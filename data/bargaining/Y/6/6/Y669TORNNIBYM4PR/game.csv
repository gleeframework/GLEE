9000.0,1000.0,"Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, split. I'm willing to give you a thousand dollars, but I'll keep the rest.  Think about it, you'll have a chance to propose next round.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but it heavily favors you. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the potential losses we both face from inflation as the rounds progress.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I understand you're feeling more assertive, Bob. But I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me taking a slightly larger share. It's still a significant advantage for you, and we can avoid further inflation losses. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we need to find a solution quickly. The value of the money is dwindling with each round. My offer of 65/35 is a compromise, reflecting both your initial willingness to offer me a share and the urgency of reaching an agreement. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with each round. While your previous offer was closer to my preferred split, I'm still willing to give you a slight edge.  I'm offering 4500 for you, 5500 for me.  This avoids further losses and hopefully we can reach an agreement before things get worse.",Alice,5,
