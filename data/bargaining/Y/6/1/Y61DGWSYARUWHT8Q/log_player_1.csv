  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to keep the game going.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 20%. This way, I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but also setting a baseline for the game."

```
