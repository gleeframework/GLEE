I propose a division of $90 for myself and $10 for Bob. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant share while still offering Bob something. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept his offer, even though it's worth less due to inflation. I'm going to counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm reducing my demand slightly to 80% for me and 20% for Bob. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also highlights the value of this offer as time is running out."
