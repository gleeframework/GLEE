Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your 60/40 split isn't appealing, Alice. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the declining value in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
