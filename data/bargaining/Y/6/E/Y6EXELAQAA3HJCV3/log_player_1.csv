"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy on the first round, now it's my turn to take a bigger cut! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a bigger cut now.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of my gain to be 300,000 dollars. However, the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, so his gain is actually equivalent to 560,000 dollars.

Considering the new values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 70-30, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's split it 55-45""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm still not impressed. Time to make a strong move! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation.

Let's calculate the actual values of the gains. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider it to be 600,000 dollars. However, the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so his gain is actually equivalent to 208,000 dollars.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 55.5-44.5, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. However, I'll also consider the fact that the money Bob gains is worth less and less with each round, so I'll try to make a stronger offer to account for that. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a bold move! I'll take 70% and leave you with 30%""

# Bob gain: 900000
