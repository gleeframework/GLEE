6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Your split was unfair to me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation disparity and is a more reasonable starting point for negotiation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly.  While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, I think a 50/50 split is the most fair way to move forward given the inflation and our previous negotiations.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
