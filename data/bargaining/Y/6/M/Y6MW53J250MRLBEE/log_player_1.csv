"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 90% and you get 10%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving you with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more than in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's offer was a 55-45 split, I'll aim for a slightly better split for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation""
}
```"
