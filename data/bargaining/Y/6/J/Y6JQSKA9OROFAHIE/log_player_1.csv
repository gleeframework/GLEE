"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't like the fact that Bob is trying to take a bigger share of the pie. I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take back some of the ground I lost. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll think about it...

Hmm... I don't want to give up too much more, but I also don't want to risk getting an even worse deal later on. I'll take a chance and accept this offer.
