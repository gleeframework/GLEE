"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful. Bob's offer is still a good starting point, but I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still looking for a fair deal""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding out for a fair deal. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! With the reduced value, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too close to the previous ones, and I'd like to see a bigger difference.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for his next proposal. I'm starting to think I might need to get more aggressive in my proposals to make up for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to be more aggressive in my proposal to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting serious, meet me halfway or we'll both lose out""
}
```

I'm trying to push Bob to meet me halfway, as I think this is a fair and reasonable compromise given the current value of the money."
