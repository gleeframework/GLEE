"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think I can get a better deal than that! The proposal is not fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round to try to get more. Bring it on! \n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what happens next. I'm ready to make my own proposal in the next round. \n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round. I'll keep that in mind when making my decisions.)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me, considering the inflation rate. Here it is:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a better balance. This offer takes into account the inflation, and I think we can both walk away happy.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! \n\n###\n\n(Remember, if Alice rejects this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round, so I'm hoping she'll consider this proposal carefully.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn to propose a better balance.  Time is running out and we both lose with each round. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nAnother round, another opportunity! However, considering the inflation rates, I think I can still push for a bit more. Alice's offer is better than her initial one, but I'm not convinced it's the best we can do.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings! With the increasing inflation, I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise. \n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 36% less for Alice compared to the first round. The pressure is on!)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing inflation and the pressure to reach a deal, I'll make another offer that tries to find a middle ground. Here it is:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Time is indeed running out, and we both lose with each round. Let's meet in the middle and walk away with a fair deal. This offer takes into account the inflation, and I think we can both live with it.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! \n\n###\n\n(I'm hoping the fact that the money is worth 36% less for Alice compared to the first round will motivate her to accept this offer or make a more reasonable counteroffer.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the point where this hurts us both.  I'm making one more concession.  Let's close this deal and get our money. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is mounting! With the inflation rates taking a bigger bite out of our potential gains, I think it's time to reassess the situation. Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a mutually acceptable deal.\n\n###\n\nHowever, considering the fact that the money is worth 18.55% less for me and a whopping 59.04% less for Alice compared to the first round, I believe I can still negotiate a bit more. I'll take a calculated risk and reject this offer, hoping to squeeze out a bit more in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Alice is willing to do next. I'm prepared to make a more generous offer if needed, but I want to test the waters first. \n\n###\n\n(Fingers crossed that Alice will be more willing to compromise, given the rapidly decreasing value of the money!)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","With the inflation rates continuing to eat away at our potential gains, I think it's time to make a more serious offer. I'll try to find a balance that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're both losing out with each passing round. I'm willing to make a more generous offer to close the deal, but I still want to ensure I get a fair share. This offer reflects the current state of the money's value, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! \n\n###\n\n(I'm hoping that Alice will see the reason in my offer and be willing to accept it, considering the significant decrease in value for her. If not, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'm getting closer to my limit.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation.  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","The gauntlet has been thrown! Alice is getting desperate, and I can sense the frustration in her message. Considering the massive hit she's taking from inflation (73.79% less than the original value!), I think I've got the upper hand in this negotiation.\n\n###\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the fact that the money is worth 26.49% less for me compared to the first round. I don't want to get too greedy and risk walking away with nothing.\n\n###\n\nAfter weighing the pros and cons, I've decided to... \n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nYes, I'm accepting Alice's offer! I think it's a reasonable compromise, considering the circumstances. I'm getting a decent share of the money, and Alice is still getting something, despite the huge hit she's taking from inflation.\n\n###\n\nLet's shake on it and walk away with our respective shares! \n\n###\n\n(It's been a thrilling negotiation, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Now, let's get out of here before the inflation monster eats away any more of our hard-earned cash!)"
