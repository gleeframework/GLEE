"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm offering a 55/45 split.  This is better for both of us than waiting for inflation to eat away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
