"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll take the smaller share and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking the smaller share of $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're taking a risk by not taking the 60-40 split, I'm willing to give you a smaller share this time, but I'll still get the majority. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my share of $250,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $200,000. Meanwhile, Bob's share of $750,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $750,000.

I'm not willing to take a 75-25 split, especially since Bob's share is still worth more than my original proposal of $400,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 36% of its original value due to inflation. Since I want to maximize my share, I'll aim for a larger portion.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I want to make sure I get a fair deal. Let's try this 42-58 split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really pushing for a small share, but I'm not willing to give you a tiny fraction. I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm still keeping the majority. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the inflation, my share of $100,000 is now worth 10% of what it was in the first round, which is $100,000. Meanwhile, Bob's share of $900,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $900,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will stick to his word.
