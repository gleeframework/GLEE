Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start with!""}

I'm proposing to split the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to get a bigger share. I'll accept the offer, but I'll try to negotiate further in the next round.
