"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amounts as follows:

My gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'll reject the offer since it's not favorable to me. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 4500 / 0.5168 = 8715.41 (approximately)
Bob's gain: 5500 / 0.8554 = 6413.15 (approximately)

I'll accept the offer since it's a better deal for me.
