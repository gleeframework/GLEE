Alice's offer:

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite steep. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Think carefully, the value diminishes with each round, especially for you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's go with a 55/45 split in my favor. This takes into account the inflation, and it's a fairer compromise than your previous offer.  If you reject this, we're both going to lose more money with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical decision for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing for Alice faster than it is for Bob. With each round, she's more likely to accept a deal less favorable to her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer means gambling on Alice offering an even better deal in the next round. However, there's also the risk of Alice lowering her offer, especially as the money loses value for her.
* **Decent Offer:** A 45/55 split isn't too far off from Bob's initial 60/40 proposal. It's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. 

Waiting longer might force Alice to offer a slightly larger percentage to Bob, but the overall value of the deal will likely be lower due to the inflation."
