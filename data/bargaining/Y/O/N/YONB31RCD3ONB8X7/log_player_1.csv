# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is already worth less for me due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further or try to get a better deal."
