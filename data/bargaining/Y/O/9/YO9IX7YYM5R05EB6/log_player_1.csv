"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I'm trying to be generous while still getting the larger share. The message is a simple ""Let's be reasonable"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game quickly.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel pressured to accept an offer that gives me less than my initial proposal. Additionally, Bob's gain is worth 5% less in this round, so I think I can negotiate a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the inflation that affects his gain. I'll offer him $420,000, which is a bit more than the $400,000 I offered initially, but still less than the $500,000 he proposed in the previous round. My message will be ""Let's find a middle ground"" to indicate that I'm willing to compromise.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}\n\nLet me know Bob's response!"
