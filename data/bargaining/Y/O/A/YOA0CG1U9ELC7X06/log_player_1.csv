"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a decent chunk of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, my gain of 7000 is worth 90% of the original 8000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is 7200. And Bob's gain of 3000 is worth 80% of the original 2000 he could have gotten, which is 2400.

This offer is even more generous than my initial one, so I'll accept it.
