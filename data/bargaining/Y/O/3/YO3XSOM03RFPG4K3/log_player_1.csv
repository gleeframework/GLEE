"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit playful to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's see if we can meet in the middle... 

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like we'll split the remaining $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
