I'm proposing to take $9000 and give Bob $1000. I figure this gives me a good starting point, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to push for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm reducing my share to $6000 and offering Bob $4000. This seems like a fair compromise considering he rejected my first offer.  I'm hoping he'll accept this, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
