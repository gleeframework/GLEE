Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking on more risk with the inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's likely Bob won't budge much further, and the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
