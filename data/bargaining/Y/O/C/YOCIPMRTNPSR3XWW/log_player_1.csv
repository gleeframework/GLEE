"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I need to consider the equivalent value in the first round. In the first round, $400,000 would be equivalent to $444,444.44 in the second round (1 / 0.9).

Considering this, I think I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

This way, I get a larger share to account for the inflation, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round. $300,000 is worth $444,444.44 in the first round (1 / 0.713, since 1 - 0.287 = 0.713).

Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the equivalent value of my gain in the first round. $550,000 is worth $393,939.19 in the first round (1 / 0.713).

Considering this, I think I'll accept this offer.
