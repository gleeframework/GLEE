"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll get the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 50/50 is a reasonable split.  Accept and we can both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 5% less than the $80 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to $76 in the first round's value.

However, I'm not sure what Bob's gain of $50 is worth in the first round's value, as the inflation effect on Bob's gain is 10% less, but I don't know the exact amount.

I'll have to consider this carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of $76 (equivalent to $50 in the current round) is worth 5% less, so it's now equivalent to $72.20 in the first round's value.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 70/30 and move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the remaining $100, which is $30. I'll get the remaining 70%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but 60/40 seems like a fair compromise.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round's value:

My gain of $40 is worth 14.26% less than $72.20 (the equivalent value of my gain in the previous round), which is a total reduction of $10.31. So, my gain of $40 is equivalent to $61.89 in the first round's value.

However, I'm not sure what Bob's gain of $60 is worth in the first round's value, as the inflation effect on Bob's gain is 27.1% less, but I don't know the exact amount.

Considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of $61.89 (equivalent to $40 in the current round) is worth 5% less, so it's now equivalent to $58.73 in the current round's value.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. 55/45 is a good compromise. Let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45. I'll get the remaining 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think 55/45 is a fair split.  Let's end this and both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... This is the same offer Bob made in Round 5, but with the money values adjusted for inflation. My gain of $45 is worth 22.62% less than $58.73 (the equivalent value of my gain in the previous round), which is a total reduction of $13.29. So, my gain of $45 is equivalent to $35.44 in the first round's value.

Considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

However, I also don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value due to inflation.
