Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split this more evenly.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is more generous, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I need to hold out for a better deal. It's still early in the game."
