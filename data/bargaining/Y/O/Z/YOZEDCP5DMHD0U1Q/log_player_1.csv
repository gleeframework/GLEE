"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see if we can do better""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game, and inviting Bob to consider if he wants to accept this offer or make a counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think we can both do better if we split it 60/40 in my favor. I'm hoping you'll see that it's in your best interest to accept this offer since the money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that I should accept a 60/40 split in Bob's favor, especially since I'm not sure how much the inflation affects him. I'd like to make a counter-proposal to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I'll make a counter-offer: 55/45 in my favor""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I'm taking a risk by giving you more. I'm hoping you'll accept this offer before the next round of inflation hits""
}
```"
