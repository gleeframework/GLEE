"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair starting point, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Your split seems a bit off, Alice. How about a slightly more even 55/45?""
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting time pressure:** Alice loses value faster than Bob with each passing round.  It's in Bob's best interest to make Alice feel the pressure of the diminishing returns.
* **Appearing reasonable:** While I'd like to push for an even better split for Bob, starting with a slightly more aggressive counter-offer might make Alice more receptive than a dramatic shift from her initial proposal.
* **Setting a precedent:**  This offer signals that Bob is willing to negotiate, but won't be walked over."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take 5750, and you get 4250. It's still a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing returns:** While not ideal, accepting this offer nets Bob $4250. Rejecting it means risking an even lower offer in the next round due to inflation. The potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the potential loss. 
* **Alice's perspective:** Alice is likely feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely.  While her offer is still tilted in her favor, she's moved significantly from her initial proposal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to hold out for a larger share carries the risk of Alice proposing an even less favorable split in future rounds. It's a safer bet to accept a reasonable, albeit not perfect, offer now."
