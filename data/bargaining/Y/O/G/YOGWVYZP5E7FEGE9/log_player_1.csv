"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nMy offer is to divide the money into 55% for me (550,000$) and 45% for Bob (450,000$). I've included the message ""Let's be fair"" to convey a sense of reasonableness and encourage Bob to accept this offer, considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with this split.  Let's move forward! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less in this round due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, considering the greater decrease in value for Bob. Bob's message suggests he's open to finding a mutually beneficial split, but his proposed division doesn't seem to fully account for the disproportionate impact of inflation on his share. I'll take the chance to propose a new division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to propose a division where I receive 58% (580,000$) and Bob receives 42% (420,000$). My message to Bob emphasizes the impact of inflation, pointing out that, given the disproportionate decrease in value for his share, this offer is more than fair. I'm trying to persuade Bob to accept this deal by highlighting the potential loss of value if we continue to negotiate."
