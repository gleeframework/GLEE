# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob is playing very aggressively and betting on you caving to the pressure of inflation.  Here's how to analyze the situation:

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing significantly for you with each round.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:**  He's rejected every offer and seems content to let the clock run down, hoping you'll panic.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** Are you willing to risk getting nothing at all in hopes of a better deal in the later rounds? 

While accepting would secure you some money, it's a minimal amount compared to what Bob gets.  There's a chance Bob is bluffing about this being his final offer.

Here's a risky counter-proposal:

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's see if Bob is serious or if we can force him to negotiate more fairly."

""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Alright Bob, I see how you want to play this. That was your 'final offer'?  The clock's ticking for both of us.  Don't get greedy.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both know this game is going nowhere. I'm offering you the same deal you just gave me, let's end this before we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a critical moment in the game. Bob is calling your bluff and trying to turn the tables. Let's break it down:

* **Bob's Strategy:** He's recognized you're willing to play hardball and is now using your own tactic against you. 
* **The Risk:** Rejecting this offer means you're entering extremely risky territory. If you don't secure a deal in the next few rounds, you'll be left with a tiny fraction of the original amount. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's still a slight chance Bob might fold under pressure in the last few rounds, offering you a larger share. However, this is a gamble.

Given the high stakes and limited time, it's strategically sound to accept Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but it's far better than walking away with nothing. 

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While it's frustrating to not get a larger share, securing something is better than risking it all for a marginally better outcome in this scenario."
