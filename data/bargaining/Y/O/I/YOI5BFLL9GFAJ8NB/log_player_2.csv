"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer seems fair on the surface, but Alice is losing value faster than I am due to the inflation mechanic. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's make it a bit more even considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more, it's still fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is correct that inflation is a factor, but she's using it as a justification to increase her share even further. This offer is worse than her initial offer, and the decreasing value of the money makes it even less appealing. I need to push for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""We're running out of time, and this offer considers the shrinking value.  Let's be reasonable and close the deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation, and this offer is barely different from her last one. While the shrinking pot is a concern, accepting a bad deal just because time is running out is not a good strategy. I need to hold firm and see if she's willing to negotiate fairly."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it.""
