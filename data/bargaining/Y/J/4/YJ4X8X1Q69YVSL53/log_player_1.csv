"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave 30 dollars for Bob. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the 50 dollars I would gain in this round is worth less than the 30 dollars I would have gained in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I'm hoping to do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll aim to gain more than I would have in the previous round, considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 40% of what it was in the first round, I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight edge""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob, hoping to get a better deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate being 48.8% less than the first round, the 45 dollars I would gain in this round is worth less than the 60 dollars I would have gained in the third round.

Considering the offer, I think 45 dollars is a reasonable amount, and taking 55 dollars is a good deal for Bob. I'll accept this offer.
