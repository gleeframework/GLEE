"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving Bob a third of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can finish the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair one. Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my valuation of the offer accordingly.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
