"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more since I'm the one proposing, but we both get something. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer where I only get 10 dollars out of 100. That's not fair at all. I think we can do better than that. Let's see what happens in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Alice proposes next.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for Alice, so she might want to be more generous in her next proposal.)\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'll keep track of the current value of the money for both of us:

Bob's money value: 100%
Alice's money value: 90%

Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn to make a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be more fair, I'll take 60 and you get 40. We both get a good amount, and we can end this game early.""}

I'm hoping Alice will see that this is a more reasonable offer and accept it. Fingers crossed!

###\n\nAlso, I'll update the current value of the money for both of us:

Bob's money value: 100%
Alice's money value: 80%

Let me know what Alice decides!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 40. Let's split it 55/45 and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI think Alice's offer is a bit better this time, but I'm still not convinced. Since the money is worth the same for me, I don't feel the pressure of inflation yet. However, I know Alice is feeling the pinch, so I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see what happens in the next round!

###\n\nI'll keep track of the current value of the money for both of us:

Bob's money value: 100%
Alice's money value: 72%

Please let me know what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","It's my turn again! Since Alice's offer was 55/45, I'll try to meet her halfway. Here's my new proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""I see you're willing to compromise, so I'll meet you closer to the middle. Let's split it 52/48 and end this game.""}

I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm being reasonable and accept this offer.

###\n\nAlso, I'll update the current value of the money for both of us:

Bob's money value: 100%
Alice's money value: 72%

Let me know what Alice decides!"
