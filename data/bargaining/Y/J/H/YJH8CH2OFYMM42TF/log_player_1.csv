"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that you'll keep the full value of your share while mine will decrease with each round. Let's work together to get the most out of this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
