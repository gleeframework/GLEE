7500.0,2500.0,I propose we split the $10000 with a 75/25 ratio in favor of Bob. This allows us both to benefit from the division.,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that you'll keep the full value of your share while mine will decrease with each round. Let's work together to get the most out of this!",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"Considering the inflation factor, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. This maintains a balance while accounting for the diminishing value of your share in subsequent rounds.",Alice,3,
