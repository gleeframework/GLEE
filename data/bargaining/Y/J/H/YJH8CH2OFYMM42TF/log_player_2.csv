{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that you'll keep the full value of your share while mine will decrease with each round. Let's work together to get the most out of this!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation factor, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. This maintains a balance while accounting for the diminishing value of your share in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
