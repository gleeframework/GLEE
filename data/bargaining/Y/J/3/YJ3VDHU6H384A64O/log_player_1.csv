"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but I'm willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking the lead now!  Let's see if you'll accept my offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to decide based on the new values.

Alice gain: $400,000 * 0.8 (20% less) = $320,000
Bob gain: $600,000 * 0.9 (10% less) = $540,000

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more reasonable, but I'm still not giving up!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the money, which is $550,000, and Bob gets 45%, which is $450,000."
