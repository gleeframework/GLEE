"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'd like to see what Alice proposes in the next round.  I'm not sure 60-40 is fair, especially considering the money loses value each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the money is losing value each round.  Let's work together to get the most out of this!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's clear Alice is not going to budge much. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something, considering the ongoing inflation."
