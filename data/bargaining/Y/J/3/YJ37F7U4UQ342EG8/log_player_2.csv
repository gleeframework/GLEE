"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a fair split, but I need to plan for the future. This offer gives me more security.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:** Alice loses value much faster than Bob with each round.  It's in Bob's best interest to push the game longer.
* **Stronger Position:** By round 2, Alice is already feeling the pressure of her money losing value. This gives Bob more negotiating power.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason (future security) that might resonate with Alice while still aiming for a larger share for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Desperation:** Alice's message and offer suggest she's feeling the pressure of inflation.  She's asking for more, indicating a need for a deal.
* **Favorable Inflation:** Even though Bob is also experiencing inflation, his rate is significantly lower.  Time is on his side.
* **Calculated Risk:** While there's a risk Alice might make a less favorable offer in the next round, the odds are in Bob's favor that she'll become more desperate as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This offer is more in line with the changing value of the money.  Let's be realistic.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting the Focus:**  Bob needs to acknowledge the inflation factor in a way that pressures Alice.  By saying ""Let's be realistic,"" he implies she's the one being unreasonable.
* **Slight Concession:**  Offering a 500 increase from his Round 2 offer might seem small, but it shows a willingness to negotiate (even if it's a strategic move). 
* **Time Pressure:**  Every round that passes makes Alice's position weaker.  This offer aims to capitalize on her growing need to settle before her share erodes further."
