# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think the split is balanced enough, and I'm still getting a relatively small share. I'll try to negotiate further!"

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more fighting over pennies! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a fair compromise!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think meeting in the middle is a good idea, and getting $5,000 is better than the 48.8% less value I would get if I rejected again."
