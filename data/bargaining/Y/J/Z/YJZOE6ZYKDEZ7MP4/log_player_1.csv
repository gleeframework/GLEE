Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be reasonable.  I'll take $55, you get $45. This deal makes sense for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
