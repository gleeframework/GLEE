Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While an even split seems fair initially, the inflation hits me harder as the game goes on. This offer ensures a good outcome for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
