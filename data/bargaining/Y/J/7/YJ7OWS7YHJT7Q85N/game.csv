8000.0,2000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair share while also ensuring a reasonable return for Bob.,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise given the initial offer was skewed too heavily in your favor.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"I propose an equal division of the $10000, which I believe is fair considering the inflation and previous offers. This ensures both of us receive an equivalent value despite the diminishing worth of money in subsequent rounds.",Alice,3,
