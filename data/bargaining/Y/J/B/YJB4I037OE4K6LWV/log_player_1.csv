Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a different division. I'll take $475000 and Alice will receive $525000. This takes into account the inflation effect and aims for a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000
