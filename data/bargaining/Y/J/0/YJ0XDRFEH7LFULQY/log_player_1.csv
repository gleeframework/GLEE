Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll, I'm willing to compromise, 52/48 is my offer.

# Bob gain: 5200

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking another round. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us. 
* **Bob's Position Weakening:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for him. He started at a 55/45 split and is now at 52/48. This indicates he's feeling the pressure of the inflation.
* **Potential Loss:** If we reject this offer and propose something closer to our Round 3 offer in Round 5, the inflation might make the final amount less favorable than what Bob is offering now. 

It's a tough decision, but in the face of rapid devaluation, securing a reasonable amount now is preferable to risking a worse outcome later."
