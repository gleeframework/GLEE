I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair given the inflation, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
