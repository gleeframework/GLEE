"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll have to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my first one, but I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept it now that he's seen my willingness to negotiate."
