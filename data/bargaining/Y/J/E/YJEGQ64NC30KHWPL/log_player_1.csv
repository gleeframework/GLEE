"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effects, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll try to get a larger share this time.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less in each round, I'll be more inclined to accept a fair split. Since Bob's offer is 50/50, it's a relatively even split, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
