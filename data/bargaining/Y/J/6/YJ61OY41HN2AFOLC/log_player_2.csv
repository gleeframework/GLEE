Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm willing to accept this offer since the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next rounds. This offer seems fair enough considering the circumstances."
