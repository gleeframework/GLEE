"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and take 60. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the value of the money will decrease for both of us in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of money, I think a 55/45 split is a good compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
