"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to see if he'll accept it. I'll also save some for myself, knowing that the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious concern. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and I'm not sure how much Bob's money is worth after inflation. It's a gamble, but I'm willing to take it."
