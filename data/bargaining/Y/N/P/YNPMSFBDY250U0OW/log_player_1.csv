"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that we have a lot of rounds left to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards him, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger bite, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up much more, but I'll try to meet you in the middle. Let's see if this is the compromise we can agree on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offers so far, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than his previous one, but I still think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. This is my final offer. Will you take it?""
}
```

I'm offering a 48-52 split, which is a bit closer to the middle than my previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet. I'll try to find a way to get a better deal. This is my last chance to make a move. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge bite out of my potential gains! With the money being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I have to be very careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I have to take it. The 50-50 split is the best I can get at this point, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and hope that I can live with the result."
