Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'm willing to lower my share, but I'd like to get more than 400k. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This seems like a reasonable compromise considering the inflation."
