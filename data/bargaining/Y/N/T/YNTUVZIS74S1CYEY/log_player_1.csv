"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you 400k, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively balanced offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be eager to get some money and accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, fair and square. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to split it down the middle!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept the middle-of-the-road offer just yet. I'll wait for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still being generous!"
