4500.0,5500.0,"I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly.  Let's start with a 55/45 split in my favor this time.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to show that I'm willing to be reasonable.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, time is ticking, and that money is losing value for you. I'll come down a little to $5,800 for me, and you get $4,200. Let's close this deal and both come out ahead!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic.  The money is losing value quickly.  I'm willing to split the remaining money evenly, giving us both $5,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with something before it's too late.",Bob,4,
