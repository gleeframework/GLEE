Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. Let's be reasonable - this split accounts for the time pressure we're both under. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is better than my initial one, but it still heavily favors him.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be steamrolled. The shrinking pot means we need to find common ground quickly."
