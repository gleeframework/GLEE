"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I'm sure you understand the value of money is decreasing with each round. Let's be reasonable and find a fair deal before the money dwindles away. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
