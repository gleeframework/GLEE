# Alice gain: 900000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to be more fair, Bob.  However, I'm still losing too much value each round.  Let's meet in the middle and split it 60/40.  This way, we both get a decent amount before the money loses too much value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
