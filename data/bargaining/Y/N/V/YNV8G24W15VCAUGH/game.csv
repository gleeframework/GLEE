7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This allows us to share fairly while considering the value depreciation in future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I'm willing to take a smaller share in the early rounds to increase the chances of a better deal later on. Let's see if we can negotiate a better split.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
