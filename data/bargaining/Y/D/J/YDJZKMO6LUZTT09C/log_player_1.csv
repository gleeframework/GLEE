"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $90 for myself, and give $10 to Bob. I'm starting with a generous offer, but I want to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, I'll accept this offer. I'm getting $5, which is better than nothing, and I'm tired of playing this game."
