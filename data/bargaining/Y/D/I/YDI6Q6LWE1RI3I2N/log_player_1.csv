"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly nudge to accept the offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but you have to think about it! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think about it... but I think I'll reject it. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and let's split it evenly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a more even split, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40%. The message is a friendly nudge to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it exactly in half, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means the money is getting scarce!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair deal, and I'm willing to accept it. Splitting it exactly in half seems like a reasonable compromise.
