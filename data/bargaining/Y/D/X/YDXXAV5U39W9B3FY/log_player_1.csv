I'm proposing a 50/50 split, a fair starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but I'm still holding my ground. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't let him take advantage of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy! I'm not going to let him take 65% while I get 35%. I'll counter his offer again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with the same split he offered me, but with the roles reversed. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation. It's time for Bob to decide."
