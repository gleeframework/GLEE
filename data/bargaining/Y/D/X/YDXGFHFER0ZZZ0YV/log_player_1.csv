"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself. It's a risk, but with the threat of inflation, we might both benefit from a quicker resolution. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the uneven split, but I'm also aware of the risk of inflation. I'll have to think carefully about this one...
