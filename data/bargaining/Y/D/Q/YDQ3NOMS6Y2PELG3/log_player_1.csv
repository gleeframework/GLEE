Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to reach a compromise. This is my final offer before we both lose significant money. I'm willing to split it more evenly than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 8 rounds remaining and inflation eating away at the value, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly with each rejection.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The difference between Bob's current offer and my previous offer is relatively small, especially when considering the impact of inflation on future rounds. 
* **Unpredictable Outcome:** There's no guarantee that Bob will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. He might become even more demanding, leading to a worse outcome than accepting the current offer.

It's frustrating to concede, but accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking a complete loss later."
