**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly decreasing her demand, time is on my side.  The inflation is eroding her potential gains faster than mine. It's time to start pushing for a more significant advantage on my end.  We're getting close to the halfway point, and the pressure is mounting on Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  Every round is costing us both. This is the most rational choice.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This accomplishes a few things:

* **Appears Fair:**  It presents a strong image of fairness, making it harder for Alice to justify rejecting on principle.
* **Time Pressure:** By now, Alice should be feeling the pressure of the dwindling pot.  This offer highlights that continued negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome for her. 
* **Sets a Benchmark:**  If she rejects this, it gives me a strong position to argue for a larger share in subsequent rounds, as I've already demonstrated a willingness to compromise."
