"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%. I'm framing it as a fair split to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take slightly more since I'm not losing as much value with each round.  Hope you agree! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll have to think carefully before accepting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was slightly biased towards him, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more to account for the inflation, but still willing to compromise""
}
```"
