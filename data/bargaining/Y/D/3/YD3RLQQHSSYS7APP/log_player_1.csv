"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can both be satisfied with the result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice's gain: $400,000 (10% less than the original $500,000)
Bob's gain: $600,000 (20% less than the original $750,000)

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's still a decent split. I'll accept it.
