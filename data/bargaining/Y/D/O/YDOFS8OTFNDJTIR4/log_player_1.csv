"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I want a bit more. Will you take 7:3? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 10% less than the original $600,000, so I'd actually be getting $540,000 if I accept this offer.

Considering the 7:3 split, I'm not too thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
