"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple and fair split, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable for the first round, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""bob_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your generosity in the last round is touching, but I think it's only fair if we switch places.  55/45 seems like a more equitable split considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. While her offer might seem appealing under time pressure, it's essential to remember that the longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes. Accepting a slightly worse offer now is better than risking getting a much worse offer later or even ending up with nothing."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking, and every second that passes costs us money. This is my final offer. Let's be reasonable and close the deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. A slightly better deal now is more advantageous than potentially getting a worse offer later.
* **Stronger position:** By stating this is my final offer, I am applying a bit of pressure on Alice, signaling that I'm serious and won't be swayed easily in further rounds.
* **Reasonable split:** While not ideal, the offer is still a reasonable split, and it's better to secure a win than risk ending up with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing it all! I'm willing to compromise. 51/49. Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's ""final offer"" bluff is a strong tactic, but the offer is now within a reasonable range, especially considering the significant inflation.  It's better to accept a less-than-ideal offer than risk getting a much worse one or even losing everything in the remaining rounds."
