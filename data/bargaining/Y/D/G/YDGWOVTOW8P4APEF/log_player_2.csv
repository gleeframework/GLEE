Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think this is more fair now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This split accounts for the diminishing value over time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, this is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, I still have some leverage. Accepting $4,000 now is a significant loss compared to the potential gains if I can get Alice to agree to a more favorable split in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out and inflation is eating into the potential gains. Offering a 50/50 split now is a strong stance that emphasizes fairness and creates a sense of urgency. Alice might be more inclined to accept a reasonable offer rather than risk getting nothing at all as the rounds progress."
