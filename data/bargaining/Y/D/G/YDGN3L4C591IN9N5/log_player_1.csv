"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation factor. I'll have to think carefully before accepting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 80% of its original value, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time. Accept and we can move forward.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% of its original value, my gain is now worth significantly less. I'll have to be careful with my decision.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I think I can live with it. The compromise seems fair, considering the circumstances.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game."
