Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal, Alice. How about this offer? It accounts for the time pressure and gives us both a chance to benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the deadline. I'm offering a deal that ensures I get compensated fairly for the inflation, leaving you with a reasonable sum. Let's be realistic and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor considering the inflation working against him.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a significant amount still, but I need to be compensated for the time pressure. Take this deal, or I'm going for an even bigger share in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting more aggressive, but his threats are starting to ring hollow. He's feeling the time pressure too, and his offer is still heavily skewed considering the inflation working against him. I need to remain firm and wait for a better offer."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes on any longer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to draw a line in the sand.  A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the inflation working against Bob.  By framing this as my ""final offer"" I'm increasing the pressure on him to accept. He's running out of time to secure anything substantial."
