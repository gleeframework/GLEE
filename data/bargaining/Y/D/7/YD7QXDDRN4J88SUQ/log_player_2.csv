Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to try to split the money more evenly, but still keep the majority for myself. Inflation is starting to hurt, so I need to get a decent amount."

# Alice gain: 700000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal. This inflation is a serious problem, but I need to get more than just a third of the original amount."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm going to keep offering a majority of the money to myself, but I'm starting to get worried about inflation. I need to find a balance between getting a decent amount and ensuring that the deal gets accepted before the value of the money drops too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is killing me, and I need to secure something before the money becomes worthless.  Even though it's a lot less than I initially wanted, getting 400,000 is better than nothing."
