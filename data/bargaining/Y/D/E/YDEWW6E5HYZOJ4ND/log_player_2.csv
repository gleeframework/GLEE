"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more, acknowledging my slight disadvantage with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's reasonable, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The inflation is working in my favor, so I have time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more than your initial offer, but I still want a larger share. This reflects the inflation advantage I have.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting you more than me. I'm offering you a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Alice's offer. While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is hurting me significantly. Accepting this offer secures me some money before the situation gets worse for me."
