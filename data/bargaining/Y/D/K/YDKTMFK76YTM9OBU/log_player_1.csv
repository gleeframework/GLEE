"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start with!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. Bob is trying to take more than 60% of the money, which is unfair. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not going to give you everything!""}

I'm trying to make a more balanced offer, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
