Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better than my last one, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with the inflation. Let's take it."
