"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent chunk""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's be a bit more realistic about our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, in real terms, I'm only gaining $4,350 (5% less than the $4,500 he's offering) and Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth $4,950 in real terms (10% less than the $5,500 he's offering). I'm hoping to do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the continued inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise."
