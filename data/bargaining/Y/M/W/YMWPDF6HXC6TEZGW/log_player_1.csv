"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to adjust my offer to get a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a bit more than 55. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the percentage decrease, it seems like Bob is trying to make up for it by offering a slightly better deal.

After considering it, I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
