"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives Bob a decent amount, but I want to secure the majority. I'm confident that if I'm too generous, Bob will just reject and then propose a split that favors him more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, and even with inflation, I'm not going to accept this. I'll take my chances with the next round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to stick to a similar strategy as the first round. I'll offer a generous amount to Bob, but still try to secure the majority for myself. The inflation might make him more willing to accept something less favorable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not great, even though inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. I'm not going to settle for less than a 50/50 split, especially since I'm the one making the next offer. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

With inflation continuing to eat away at the value of the money, I'm going to propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This feels like a fair compromise, especially considering that I've been rejecting Bob's offers for a while. It's risky to keep going, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this deal before the money loses even more value."
