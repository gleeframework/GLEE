"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30, and I'll take 70. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can do better. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 50 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the actual amount I'll get is 50 * 0.9 = 45.

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
