# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation is hitting me harder, but her offer is taking advantage of that fact. I need to hold out for a better deal, even with the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""This is my final offer that's above a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""}

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  This offer is still somewhat generous considering the inflation, but firm to show I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal. This puts the pressure on Alice to accept a decent offer before the shrinking pot makes it unattractive to her."
