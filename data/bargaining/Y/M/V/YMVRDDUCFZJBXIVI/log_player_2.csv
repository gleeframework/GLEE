Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, but still giving Alice a significant amount. Hopefully, this shows her that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not afraid to take a large share."

Alice is still being very greedy, but at least she's showing some willingness to negotiate. However, the offer is still far too low. I'm going to reject and see if she'll come up with something more reasonable in the next round."
