"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to be generous and offer Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead now, let's split it 60-40, this time in my favor! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split in Bob's favor, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

After some thought, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still aiming for a majority!""
}
```"
