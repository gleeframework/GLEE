"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, considering it's the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the effective amount I gain is $7,000 (80% of $8,000).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
