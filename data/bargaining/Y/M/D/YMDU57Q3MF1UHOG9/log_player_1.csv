"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining rounds evenly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share now and avoid risking a worse deal later! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather wait for a better offer, considering the inflation will continue to erode the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A fair split, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! Take this and let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I was being a bit greedy, wasn't I?

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the deal. It's not as good as I wanted, but I'd rather have some money now than risk getting nothing if we go to the next round."
