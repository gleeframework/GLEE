"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**My reasoning:**

Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm erring on the side of caution. A 90/10 split seems like a fair offer while still giving me a significant portion of the money. I believe Bob will accept it, as even with inflation, 100,000$ is a considerable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer isn't ideal, it's better than nothing. My share is now worth 80% of the original 100,000, which is 80,000.  It's unlikely Bob will offer anything better in the next round, as I'll be taking another 20% hit. Accepting this offer allows me to secure something, albeit a reduced amount."
