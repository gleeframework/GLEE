"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to do better. I'll offer a 30/70 split, hoping to get a larger share for myself.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amount I'd gain from Alice's offer in round 3 is equivalent to 40 / 0.64 = 62.5 in the first round, which is a decent offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer.
