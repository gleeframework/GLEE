"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 30/70 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'm thinking about the future and trying to make the most of it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
