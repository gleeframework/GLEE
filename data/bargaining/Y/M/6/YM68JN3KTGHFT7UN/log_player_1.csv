"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth less than my initial 5000. I'd like to reject this offer and try to get a better deal. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll aim to get a higher share this time. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping to take advantage of the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
