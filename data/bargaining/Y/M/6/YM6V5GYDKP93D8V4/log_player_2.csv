Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we swap our previous offers?  $55 for me and $45 for you. It's still a decent deal considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
