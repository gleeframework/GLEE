"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm taking a bigger cut this round but we can end this quickly 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy. I'm not too thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I'd rather end the game quickly.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
