Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money over time. We can both get a decent amount, and I think it's better than risking getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
