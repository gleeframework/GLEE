"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way to 50/50 yet! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the value of the money Bob gains. With inflation, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so his gain is effectively $600,000 - 5% of $600,000 = $570,000.

In this round, I'd be getting $400,000, which is a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's enough considering the potential gains in future rounds. I'm also not sure if Bob will offer a better deal in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will improve it in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to $550,000, which is closer to the 50/50 split I initially proposed. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to give up too much, but I'll meet you halfway. Let's see if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so his gain is effectively $520,000 - 14.26% of $600,000 = $442,620.

Considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll calculate the effective value of my gain in this round. Since the money is worth 14.26% less, my gain of $480,000 is effectively worth $480,000 - 14.26% of $400,000 = $424,720.

This offer is still a bit too skewed towards Bob's gain, but I'm getting closer to my target. I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's a slightly better deal than the previous one.
