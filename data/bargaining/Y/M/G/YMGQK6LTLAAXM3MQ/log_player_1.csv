"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer is quite generous, but I'm hoping Bob will take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for a better split 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. If I accept, I'll get 70, but if I reject, the money will be worth 0.9 times 70, and I'll have to make another offer. Considering the inflation, I think it's better to take the sure 70 now.
