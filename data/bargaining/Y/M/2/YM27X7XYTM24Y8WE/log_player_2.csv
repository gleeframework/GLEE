"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take the majority, but you get a decent starting point. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 1000$ starting point is something, it's a very small portion of the total money. It's worth exploring other options, especially with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think a 40/60 split is a good starting point. It's fair, and gives us both a decent amount to work with.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer.  Let's try 70/30 this time.  If we can't find common ground, we'll both end up with less as the rounds go on. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 3000$ is a tempting offer, it's still a relatively small share.  I believe we can negotiate a more equitable split, especially considering the decreasing value of the money with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 45/55 split this time.  We're both losing money with each round, and this feels like a reasonable compromise.  It's closer to my previous offer and gives you a larger share, but hopefully, we can agree on something before it's too late.""}
