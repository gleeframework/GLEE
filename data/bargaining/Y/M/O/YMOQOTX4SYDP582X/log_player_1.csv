"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly. I'm confident I can get a better deal in later rounds if necessary, as the inflation will hurt him more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, even with inflation.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still offering a very generous deal to Bob, but I've reduced my offer slightly to account for inflation. I believe this is still a fair offer considering the potential for further inflation and the fact that I'm taking the risk of losing more if we continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than what I'm willing to accept, even with the increased inflation.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I believe this is still a good deal for both of us. Bob is now losing a lot more due to inflation, and I'm confident he'll be willing to accept this offer before he loses even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 352000 
# Bob gain: 648000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough for me.  Inflation is hurting him much more than me, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. Bob is now losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, and I believe he'll accept this offer before he loses even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 409515 
# Bob gain: 590485 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept,  I'm still confident I can secure a larger share.  The inflation is significantly impacting him, and I'm ready to risk a few more rounds to maximize my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still confident that Bob will accept it. He's losing a lot of money due to inflation, and I think he'll realize that he's better off taking what he can get now rather than risking getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 496730 
# Bob gain: 503270 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is not ideal, it's becoming increasingly likely that we'll both lose all the money if we keep rejecting each other's proposals. Given the rapid inflation rate, especially for Bob, this offer is the best outcome for me at this point. I'm accepting it to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
