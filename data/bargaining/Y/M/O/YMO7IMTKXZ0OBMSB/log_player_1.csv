I'm going for a bold strategy in the first round.  I'm offering Bob a tiny share, hoping he'll be tempted to accept quickly before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money, and I have no way of knowing how the inflation will affect future rounds.  It's a safer bet than risking further rounds."
