Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  This way we both get a decent share.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money more evenly, with me getting 55% and you getting 45%.  This ensures a fairer split while still giving you a significant share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
