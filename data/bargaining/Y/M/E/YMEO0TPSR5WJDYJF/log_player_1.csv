"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can avoid any potential disagreements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to consider that. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to decide based on the relative values. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 40 is a good deal for me, considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's previous offer in mind, I'll make a new proposal. Since I rejected his offer, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This way, I'm aiming for a slightly better split, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I'll have to reassess the offer. Considering the significant drop in value of Bob's gain, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer, as the risk of inflation affecting my gain is still relatively low, and I'd rather have some money now than risk waiting for a better deal that might not come."
