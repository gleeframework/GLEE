"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in this round, hoping to keep the negotiations going and see if he'll be willing to accept a smaller share in the early stages of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my target amount should be adjusted accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
