"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a different split.""}\n\n###\nI'll offer a different division that benefits me a bit more, considering the inflation.\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice says this is her final offer, I think it's better to accept this deal rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds.\n\n###"
