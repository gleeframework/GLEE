I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving 900,000 dollars and Bob receiving 100,000 dollars. I'm aiming for a large portion to start, knowing the value will decrease for both of us in the next rounds."

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than his previous one, it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation rate.  I'm still hoping to secure a larger share, even if it means pushing the negotiation further."
