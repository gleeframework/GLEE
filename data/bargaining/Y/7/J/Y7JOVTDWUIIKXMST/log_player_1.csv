"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1 and keeping the remaining $999,999 for myself. My message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will take the easy way out!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Half and half, let's settle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is now worth less than it was in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept the offer of $500,000 each, as I think I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'm going to try to take a slightly more aggressive stance and aim for a higher share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting low, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. My message is a bit of a warning, hinting that Bob's share is getting smaller with each passing round."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Trying to squeeze out a better deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I need to consider whether this is a good opportunity to take a bigger share.

However, since Bob's offer is now 60/40 in his favor, I'm not thrilled about it. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a worse offer in the next round, allowing me to take an even bigger share."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. My message is a warning that the stakes are getting higher, and I'm taking a bigger risk by offering such a small share to Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance, let's split it 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now worth even less than it was in the first round. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not ready to give in just yet.

However, considering the offer is 70/30 in Bob's favor, I think I should take it. It's not a great deal, but it's better than walking away with nothing.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $300,000 and call it a day."
