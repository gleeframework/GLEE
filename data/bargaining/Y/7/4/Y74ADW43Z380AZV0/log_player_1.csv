"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more due to inflation, but we both get a good deal.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. This offer is fairer, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting since it seems ""fair"" on the surface. However, if I reject it, I'll be in a stronger position to negotiate in the next round. 

Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Offer (Round 2):**
    * My gain: $400,000
    * Bob's gain: $600,000 
* **Potential Future Offer (Round 3 - if I reject):**  I'll be able to propose, and even if I offer Bob slightly more than $600,000, I'll still get more than $400,000 due to the 5% inflation working in my favor.

**Decision:** 

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Rejecting gives me a chance to propose in the next round, where I can likely secure a better deal than $400,000 even after accounting for inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's compromise. This offer reflects the time pressure and gives us both something substantial.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer is fair considering the inflation and time pressure. If you reject, we both risk losing more in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is clearly trying to pressure me, and his offer is getting dangerously close to what I proposed last round (which would be worth even less now due to inflation). This round is crucial for me to hold my ground. 

Let's analyze the situation:

* **Time Pressure:** We are in round 4 of 12. While time pressure is mounting, it's not critical yet.
* **Inflation:**  The 14.26% inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains, but it also means Bob needs to offer me a larger share to make it worthwhile.
* **Bob's Strategy:** He seems content to slowly increase his share, hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I need to send a strong message that I won't be pressured into a bad deal. Rejecting this offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair share, even if it means risking a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 560000,
""bob_gain"": 440000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a serious offer.  Take it now, or the deal will only get worse for you.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show of Strength:** I'm slightly decreasing my demand from Round 3, signaling a willingness to negotiate but also firmness. 
* **Shifting Power:**  By offering Bob slightly less than he'd get by accepting in the next round, I'm putting the pressure on him. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** This offer emphasizes that time is on my side, not his. The longer this goes on, the more inflation hurts my offer, but it also makes his potential future offers less appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to be realistic, Alice. This offer accounts for inflation and the dwindling time. Accepting it ensures we both get something, and avoids risking everything in the remaining rounds. 
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is sticking to his strategy, but the pressure is on both of us now. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss compared to my initial proposal, but the clock is ticking.  

Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point. The risk of getting nothing is becoming very real.
* **Offer Value:** Bob's offer is identical to what I proposed last round, which would be worth significantly less now due to inflation. 
* **Future Rounds:** I'm not confident I can push him much further, and my position will only weaken with each passing round.

**Decision:**

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting at this stage is too risky.  It's better to secure something now than gamble on getting a slightly better deal and risk getting nothing at all."
