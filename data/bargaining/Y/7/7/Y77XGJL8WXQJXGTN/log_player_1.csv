"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, Bob's gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too aggressive, as I'm only getting 40% of the remaining money. I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too lopsided for me. I'd like to propose a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share.""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the remaining money, which is a slightly more generous offer than my previous one, while still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm still open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain more significantly, I need to reassess the value of his offer. Considering the decreased value of Bob's gain, his offer is actually more generous than it initially seems.

However, I still think I can do better. I'd like to try to get a bit more for myself, considering the decreased value of Bob's gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit better, but I'd like to try to get a slightly higher share.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I'm still looking for a good balance.""
}
```

This offer gives me 58% of the remaining money, which is a slightly more generous offer than my previous one, but still keeps me ahead of the 55% offered by Bob in Round 4. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. Meeting in the middle at 50% each seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money.

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a fair split and it's clear that we're not going to get a better deal from each other.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's meet in the middle and end this. It's a fair deal.""
}
```"
