"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal for both of us considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can negotiate for a better deal.  I'm going to see what Alice proposes next round, considering the money is worth less to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to 40 for myself this round.  Since the value is decreasing for me, I'm hoping we can reach a deal quickly.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a more even split. This is my counter-offer, let's try to wrap this up quickly. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a slightly higher share, the value of the money is decreasing for me rapidly.  It's better to take this offer now rather than risk getting nothing at all."
