I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer in this round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob is proposing a 40/60 split in his favor, which is worse for me than my previous offer. I will reject and continue the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Since Bob rejected my offer, I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  It's fairer and, with inflation, I think it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if he accepts."
