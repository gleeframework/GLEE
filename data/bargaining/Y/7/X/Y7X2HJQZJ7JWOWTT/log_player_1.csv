"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. While it's tempting to accept, the inflation is too high for me to accept such a small share, especially considering I'll have the chance to make the proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly bigger share this round, but still keeping the majority for myself. It's a gamble, but I believe he'll see the value of getting something now before inflation eats away at the potential gains in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer again. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the next few rounds. I'll hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, hoping he'll realize that the longer we wait, the less money we'll both get. This offer still gives me a significant share while acknowledging the increasing impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer.  Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still holding out for a more equitable split. While Bob is getting a significant portion, I believe I can still get a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

We're running out of time, and the inflation is really starting to bite. I'm offering Bob a larger share this round in hopes of reaching an agreement.  It's a risky move, but with each round, the value of the money decreases, and it's becoming more likely that we'll both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is getting worse, I'm still going to reject this offer. I've already offered Bob a more even split in previous rounds, and I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the next two rounds. I'm hoping that Bob will realize the danger of running out of time and come to an agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

We're getting down to the wire now. With inflation hitting hard, I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is the fairest and most likely to be accepted by Bob. This seems like the best strategy to avoid the risk of both of us getting nothing."
