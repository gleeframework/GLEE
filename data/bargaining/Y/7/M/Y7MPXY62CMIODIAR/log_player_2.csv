"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this deal and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is substantial, I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous this round, Alice.  Let's split it 60/40, and we both can move on.  Think about it, with each round passing, the money is worth less for you.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit from inflation, and you're just stalling.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's final offer is still a good deal for me.  The money is slowly losing value, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
