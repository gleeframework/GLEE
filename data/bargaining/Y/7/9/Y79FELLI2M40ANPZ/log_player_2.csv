Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly with each round, hurting me more than you. I'm offering you $45 which is a better deal than it seems right now.  Don't let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
