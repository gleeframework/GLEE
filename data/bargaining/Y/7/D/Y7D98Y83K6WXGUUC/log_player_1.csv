"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of 400,000 is actually equivalent to 500,000 in the first round, which is a decent share. But I'm not sure if I want to give Bob 600,000, which is equivalent to 750,000 in the first round.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now! I'll think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the first round, my gain of 450,000 is actually equivalent to 933,333 in the first round, which is a good share. Bob's gain of 550,000 is equivalent to 833,333 in the first round, which is a decent share as well.

I'll accept this offer.
