Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to be fair, but I think it's time to take a more pragmatic approach. I'm willing to offer you a smaller share this round, but the money is quickly losing value, so let's make sure we get as much as possible. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
