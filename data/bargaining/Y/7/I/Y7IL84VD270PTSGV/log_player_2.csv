"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Bob. It makes more sense for Bob to wait for a larger share, as the money will devalue quicker for Alice than it will for him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation impacts us differently. Let's make it worthwhile for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Counter:** This offer flips the script on Alice's initial proposal. It sends a clear message that Bob understands the game's dynamics and is playing to his advantage.
* **Early Advantage:** While Bob could wait longer,  securing a favorable split early minimizes risk. 
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  The message aims to be firm but not overly aggressive. It leaves room for Alice to counter-propose in a way that might still be acceptable to Bob in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground, inflation is hitting me harder! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still not favorable enough for Bob.  While a 45/55 split seems close to the middle, the real value of the money is shifting each round in Bob's favor.  He can afford to hold out for a better offer as long as he doesn't get too greedy and push Alice away from the negotiating table."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 630000,
""alice_gain"": 370000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing fast.  This offer benefits us both."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** Bob is increasing his demand slightly to capitalize on the time pressure and the fact that Alice is more affected by inflation.
* **Justification:** While the offer leans more in Bob's favor, he's framing it as a solution that considers the time constraints and diminishing value for both parties. This softens the blow and makes it seem less like an ultimatum.
* **Potential for Agreement:** This offer leaves Alice with a decent sum, especially given the dwindling value in later rounds. She might be more inclined to accept a less favorable split now rather than risk getting an even smaller share later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, let's compromise! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Shifting Dynamics:** While not ideal, Alice's offer is now reasonably close to an even split. More importantly, the rapid inflation is starting to erode the potential gains even for Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a significantly better offer in later rounds is increasingly risky. Alice might become desperate and offer a low amount, or the diminishing value might make even a larger share less appealing.
* **Securing a Win:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a sizable portion of the money.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting nothing at all if the negotiations fail."
