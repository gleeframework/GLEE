**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the inflation eats into her potential gains.  While her offer isn't terrible, holding out a bit longer could force her to offer a more favorable split for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I'm holding firm, this is a fair deal given the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm repeating my previous offer to signal that I'm serious about getting a larger share.  While Alice's offers have been slowly creeping towards a more even split, I believe the pressure of inflation will push her to accept a deal that is slightly more beneficial to me."
