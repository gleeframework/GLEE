"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think meeting in the middle is a good idea, as I would rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 50-50 split that Bob suggested."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 45-55 split, as I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I don't think I should be getting less than 50%. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal again."

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 45-55 split that Bob suggested. I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and getting a good deal for myself."
