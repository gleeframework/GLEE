Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it closer to even,  I think it's in both our best interests to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I would prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  With each round, the value of Bob's potential gains decreases. This means his incentive to accept a deal, even one less favorable to him, increases.
* **Future Offers:** While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's likely he won't go much higher in future rounds.  Rejecting this offer risks him offering even less in the next round.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable gain. Rejecting and continuing the game introduces uncertainty and the potential for an even lower offer."
