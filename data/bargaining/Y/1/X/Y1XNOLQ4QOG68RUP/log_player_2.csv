Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the time value of money.  Let's settle this now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This offer gives you a healthy share while still ensuring I get a reasonable return.  Let's end this before the value of our money drops further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's not a perfect split, but waiting any longer will only hurt both of us. A 45/55 split is better than risking an even worse offer in later rounds."
