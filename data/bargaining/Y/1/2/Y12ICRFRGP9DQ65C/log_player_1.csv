"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, and I'll take 60%. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's switch the roles this round! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob is feeling generous, but I'm not sure I want to give him the upper hand. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the previous round, the total amount of money is now effectively $8,000 for me and $9,000 for Bob.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're being generous, but I'll take a slightly smaller share this time!""
}
```"
