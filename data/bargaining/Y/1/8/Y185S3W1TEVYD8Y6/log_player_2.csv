Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the value is decreasing, I'm still aiming to get a better deal than Alice's consistently increasing offers. The rate of inflation will slow down, and Alice might start panicking in later rounds, leading to potentially better offers from her."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your share is melting, accept now! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Inflation is biting hard, and Alice is steadily increasing her share. However, I'm betting on Alice becoming more willing to compromise as we get closer to the deadline and she risks getting nothing.  There's still a chance for a slightly better deal."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be stubborn, your share is almost worthless! 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's officially time to panic.  My share has eroded drastically, and while Alice's offer is still slightly below my ideal, getting nothing is a very real possibility now.  Better to take a smaller share than risk total loss in the remaining rounds."
