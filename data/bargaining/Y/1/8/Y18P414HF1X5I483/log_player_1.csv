Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly aggressive but reasonable first offer.  I figure I should get the majority, but it's important to keep Bob happy enough to potentially accept.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer. While I did want more, the inflation is starting to bite. It's better to accept and get a decent split than risk getting nothing."
