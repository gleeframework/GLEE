{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose that I get $990,000 and Bob gets $10,000.  I am being generous, but I want to start strong and make sure I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he'll be willing to negotiate further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
``` 

I'm going to try to stay in the driver's seat, but I want to show some flexibility.  This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share than my first offer, but I still get the majority of the money.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more aggressive. He's obviously trying to push me into accepting a deal that's increasingly unfavorable to me.  However, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round.  I'm going to reject his offer and see what he's willing to do next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of taking the majority, but I'm going to increase Bob's share slightly to see if it's enough to convince him.  I'm hoping he'll realize that continuing to reject my offers will only hurt him more in the long run due to the increasing impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming more aggressive, but his offer is still too low. I am confident that I can get a better deal, and I'm going to hold out.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm willing to take a gamble and see what happens in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm willing to concede a bit more to Bob, but I still believe I can secure the majority of the money. I'm hoping that this offer is enough to convince him, as the inflation is starting to take a serious toll on both of us.  If he continues to reject my offers, I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm aware of the escalating impact of inflation, but I believe I can still secure a larger share.  I'm going to reject his offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure from the inflation, but I'm still holding on to the majority. This offer gives Bob a larger share than my previous offer, and I'm hoping that it will be enough to convince him.  However, I'm aware that time is running out, and we're both losing more and more money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to panic. The inflation is hitting hard, and I'm losing a significant amount of money with each passing round.  I need to accept Bob's offer before the value of the money dwindles even further. It's a 50/50 split, which is not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing at all."
