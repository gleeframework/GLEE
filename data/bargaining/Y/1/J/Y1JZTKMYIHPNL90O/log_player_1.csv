"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'll keep $600,000, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the potential inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think this is a fair split, considering the inflation is affecting me more than you!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, due to inflation, the $400,000 I would gain is actually worth less than the $600,000 Bob would gain. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation is affecting me more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the original amount, and keeping $550,000, which is 55% of the original amount."
