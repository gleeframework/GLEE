"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not getting nothing! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a larger share of the pie.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not too thrilled about giving up 30$ when I could potentially get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will make a new proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is a bit more skewed in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"

# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers!

Considering the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 80$ when I could potentially get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will make a new proposal."
