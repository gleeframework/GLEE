Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fairer, considering we both have an equal say in this. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
