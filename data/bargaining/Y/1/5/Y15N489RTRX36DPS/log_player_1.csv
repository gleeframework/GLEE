I propose a 50/50 split. It's the fairest and simplest way to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to increase my share slightly, hoping to find a middle ground. Let's split it 55/45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, Bob is offering a decent amount, and we're already losing a significant amount of money due to inflation.  I think it's best to accept."
