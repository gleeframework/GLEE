"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining $80. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of $50 is actually worth $45 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly, as I could potentially get a better deal in future rounds. I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, so my gain of $50 is actually worth $40 in real terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is worth $40 in real terms, and I'll take the remaining $60. I'm hoping Bob will accept this slightly more favorable offer for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation we've experienced.  Let's move forward with this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains.

Considering the offer, my gain of $40 is actually worth $29.28 in real terms, which is a significant decrease from the $80 I could have had in the first round.

However, I don't think it's worth risking it and waiting for a better offer, considering the inflation is accelerating. I'll accept this offer.
