Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, slightly more for me since I'm taking the initial risk. This way we both benefit from a quick resolution. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the current proposal, I feel that the slight increase for Alice is not justified, and I believe we can find a more balanced division. Let's see what the next round brings!"
