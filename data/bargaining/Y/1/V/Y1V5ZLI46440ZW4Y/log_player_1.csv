"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. I'll reject it and try to get a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm increasing my share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
