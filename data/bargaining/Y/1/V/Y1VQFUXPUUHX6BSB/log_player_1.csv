"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the smaller share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me taking the smaller share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth less for me, but I'm still interested in getting a fair share. Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split."
