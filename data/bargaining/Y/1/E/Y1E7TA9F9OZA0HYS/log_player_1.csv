"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money 60-40. I'll get a bit more, but it's a good deal for both of us!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous amount, considering I could try to negotiate for more. The message is friendly and suggests that the split is fair, which might persuade Bob to accept the offer and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was tempting, Alice, but let's be realistic.  How about a 52/48 split in your favor?  It accounts for the time value of money, giving you a good share while still being fair for me. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nThe offer seems reasonable, but considering the inflation, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and only 5% less for Bob, I should aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I can try to take advantage of the fact that Bob is more affected by the passage of rounds and might be willing to accept a less favorable deal to end the game sooner."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value.
{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's consider the time value of money. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll take a bit more to compensate for the loss. This 58-42 split is still a good deal for you, Bob!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $420,000, which is less than his previous offer, but still a significant amount. The message explains the reasoning behind the offer, taking into account the inflation and the time value of money. This might persuade Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time and the money is losing value fast.  I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split in your favor.  It's a slight adjustment from my previous offer, acknowledging the time pressure but still ensuring a reasonable outcome for both of us.  Let's close the deal! 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I should reevaluate my strategy. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me and only 14.26% less for Bob, it's crucial to end the game soon to minimize further losses.
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a relatively fair split, and the adjusted amounts due to inflation still result in a substantial gain for me. Continuing the game would lead to further devaluation of the money, making this offer more attractive than potential future offers."
