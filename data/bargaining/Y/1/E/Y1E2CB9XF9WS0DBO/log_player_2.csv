Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40. It's better to settle now before inflation eats away at the value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'll take a small hit and accept $55. It's still more than what you offered, and the longer we wait, the less we'll both have. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
