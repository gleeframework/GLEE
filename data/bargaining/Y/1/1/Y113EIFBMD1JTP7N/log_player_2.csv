Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worth it.  Let's split it 60/40 this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hitting Alice much harder than Bob. It's worth waiting for a better offer, even considering the impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and your share is shrinking fast. I'm being generous, but this is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** By stating this is Bob's ""final offer,"" it creates a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Shifting Power:** The decreasing value for Alice gives Bob more leverage to push for a better deal. 
* **Appearing Generous:** Offering 70/30 might make Alice more inclined to accept, given the rapidly changing circumstances.

While there's risk Alice might reject this, the combination of time pressure and a seemingly generous offer increases the likelihood of her accepting before her potential gain diminishes further."
