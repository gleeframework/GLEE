Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything, but I'll leave Bob with a dollar just to make sure he doesn't reject the offer outright. Let's see if he's willing to play along!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
