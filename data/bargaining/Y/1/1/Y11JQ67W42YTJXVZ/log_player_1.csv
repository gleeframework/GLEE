"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Given that we're starting with a significant amount, I believe this split is reasonable and shows a willingness to share the wealth, but also acknowledges my initiative in making the first offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we both face. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the offer seems somewhat fair at first glance, considering the impact of inflation, my share of $450,000 in the second round is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. Given that inflation affects me more significantly (20% decrease for me vs. 5% for Bob), I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds or make a counteroffer that better reflects the changing value of the money. Let's proceed and see how the game unfolds!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob $420,000 while I take $580,000. Given the ongoing inflation, where my share's value decreases by 20% each round and Bob's by 5%, I believe this adjustment is necessary to reflect the changing value of the money. By slightly increasing my share from the initial offer, I'm compensating for the loss in value due to inflation, while still presenting Bob with a significant amount, albeit slightly less than in the first round. This offer aims to find a middle ground that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's see how Bob responds to this adjusted proposal!"
