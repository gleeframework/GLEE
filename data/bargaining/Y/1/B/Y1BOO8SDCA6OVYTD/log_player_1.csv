"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money for myself, offering Bob just $1. While this seems unfair, the rapid inflation makes it advantageous for me to maximize my share in the first round. If Bob rejects this offer, the money will be worth significantly less for me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Due to inflation, any further rounds will significantly reduce the value of the money I earn, making this 50/50 split the most advantageous option."
