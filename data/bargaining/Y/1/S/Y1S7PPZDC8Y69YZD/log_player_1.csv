Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see how Bob responds!  I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I get less than my initial proposal, it's still a decent gain, and with the inflation, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
