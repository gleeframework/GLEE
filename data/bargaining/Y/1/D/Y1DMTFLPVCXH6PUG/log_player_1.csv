"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer. My gain of 40 is now worth 36 (40 - 10% of 40), which is not enough for me.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 10% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really catching up! My gain is worth a lot less now.

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the actual value of my gain after the inflation: 20 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = 14.54. It's still a relatively small amount.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation eating away at my potential gain, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
