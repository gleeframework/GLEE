Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is generous!  I'm hoping to start with a good chunk of the money and see where this goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, it's better to take what's offered now. With each passing round, my share will get smaller, and Bob's is actually shrinking faster than mine. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
