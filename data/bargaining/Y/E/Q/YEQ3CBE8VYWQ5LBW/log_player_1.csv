"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering $55 to myself and $45 to Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. We both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he suggests it's a fair split, he's actually offering me $45, which is less than what I offered him in the previous round. Considering the 5% inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nGiven the 5% inflation since the first round, the value of the money has decreased. I'm now offering $52 to myself and $48 to Bob, with a message suggesting that we find a middle ground, taking into account the decrease in value. Hopefully, this offer will be more acceptable to Bob!"
