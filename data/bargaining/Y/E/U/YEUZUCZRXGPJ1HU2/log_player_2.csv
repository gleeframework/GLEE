"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair split now, with inflation, I know that the money will be worth less to me in future rounds. I'll try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we should switch it up, with me taking a slightly larger share this time. But I'm open to negotiations if you're not happy with this proposal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest way to divide the money, and we can both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While a 50/50 split seems fair, I'm still concerned about the inflation rate. I know that with each round, the money becomes less valuable, so I'll try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger risk this time, and offer you a smaller share. But remember, the money will be worth less with each passing round, so let's work out a deal that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to concede a little more this time to avoid the risk of getting nothing.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice has conceded more than in the previous rounds, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  It's time to take the deal and secure some profit, even if it's not the ideal scenario."
