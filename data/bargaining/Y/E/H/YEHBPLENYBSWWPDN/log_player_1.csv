"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is still a decent compromise. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced value of money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of money, I'm not as keen on accepting a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is still a compromise, and I don't want to risk rejecting it and facing an even worse offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get in this inflationary environment!"
