"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm starting with a very unfair offer, knowing that Bob is likely to reject it.  This sets up a situation where I can make a more balanced offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a classic negotiation tactic. Bob is trying to leverage the ""inflation"" to make his offer seem more attractive.  However, I am confident that if I reject his offer, I can propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 499999, ""bob_gain"": 500001}
```

Now, since both of us have rejected each other's unfair offers, it's time to be reasonable. This is a 50/50 split, offering a fair division of the remaining value after inflation."
