Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I get $60, you get $40. It's a fair starting point, don't you think?

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  Time is money, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the negotiation, but your last offer wasn't fair considering the inflation working against you. Let's meet in the middle -  55 for me, 45 for you.  It's a reasonable deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is hurting both of us now. Let's split this evenly and end the game. 50/50, take it or leave it.""}
