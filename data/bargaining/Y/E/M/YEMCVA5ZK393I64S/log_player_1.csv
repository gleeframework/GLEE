"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial 100$ and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me.

Considering the offer, I'll think for a moment...

Since the offer is a 50/50 split, I'll have to accept it to get 50$.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
