"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (900,000$) and leaves Bob with a smaller share (100,000$).  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my initial proposal, it's still not fair considering the inflation. I'm willing to wait another round to make my own offer and try to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since Bob's last offer was 30/70, I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I still want a majority share. With each round, inflation is eating away at my potential gains, so I want to secure a good deal before it gets too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, Bob's offer is the most favorable I've seen yet. Accepting this offer secures me a substantial amount of money, even with the inflation taken into account. It's a good compromise and a better outcome than risking another round and potentially getting a worse offer."
