I propose you get 900,000 and Bob gets 100,000. Let's see if he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 
 
I'm going to offer Bob 150,000 and keep 850,000 for myself.  Since he rejected my previous offer, I'm assuming he wants more, but this is still a fair deal with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, I've lost a significant amount of potential earnings due to inflation. It's better to take 150,000 now than risk getting nothing if we keep going."
