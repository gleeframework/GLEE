"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very generous offer for Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly. This way, I minimize the risk of inflation eating away at my potential winnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is essentially a reverse of my initial offer.  Since the money I gain is now worth 10% less due to inflation, I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me so little, especially since the next round is still possible and allows me to make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

Since Bob rejected my generous offer in round 1, and I rejected his counter-offer in round 2, it seems like he's aiming for a bigger share of the money.  I'm going to propose a more even split, but still with a decent advantage for myself, as I'm now losing 20% of my potential earnings due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very lopsided in his favor. Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to make a more aggressive offer,  aiming for a larger share to compensate for the increasing inflation. While it's risky, I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of getting something rather than risking nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable, and the inflation is really starting to hurt.  However, I'm still going to reject this offer.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  The next round is the last chance to make a deal before we both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm raising my offer again, hoping to entice Bob. It's still a very unfavorable offer for me, but it's my last chance to secure some money before the inflation wipes out my potential winnings entirely. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking a decent share of the money, rather than risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very bad.  I'm losing more than half of the potential money due to inflation.  It's a risky move, but I'm going to reject this offer again.  I still have two more rounds to negotiate and hope to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is my last chance to secure some money. I'm going to raise my offer once more and hope that Bob sees the value in getting some of the money. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping he will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very bad, even though the inflation has taken a huge bite out of my potential gains. However, I still have two more rounds, and I am not going to give up on getting a better deal.  The risk of getting nothing at all is still too high."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is my last chance to get anything at all. The inflation is crippling, but I have to try to get at least half of the remaining money.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in splitting the money evenly and ending this stressful negotiation."
