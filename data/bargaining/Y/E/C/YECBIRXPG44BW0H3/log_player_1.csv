"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair proposal to see if Bob will accept it. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000 each, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me $400,000, since it's worth 5% less than what I initially proposed. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll try to get a better share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, $300,000 is worth a significant amount less than what I initially proposed. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even lower value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
