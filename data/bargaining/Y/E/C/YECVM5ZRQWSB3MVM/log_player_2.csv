"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Bob in later rounds. Accepting 4000$ now might seem tempting, but rejecting gives Bob more negotiating power as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's keep it simple and split 50/50.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob has a time advantage due to inflation, appearing too greedy early on could push Alice away from a fair deal.  A 50/50 split is a strong starting point for negotiation. It signals fairness while leaving room for Bob to leverage his position in later rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I've adjusted the offer. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to sweeten the deal slightly, but it's not enough.  The inflation is working significantly in Bob's favor.  He can afford to be patient and push for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice.  This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for Bob to start asserting his advantage. This offer is a significant move from his initial 50/50 proposition, reflecting the impact of inflation.  The message emphasizes the time pressure, subtly reminding Alice that every round makes the deal worse for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't forget, I'm losing value too. Meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is feeling the pressure, but she's trying to frame the situation as if they are both losing equally.  This isn't true. Bob's loss in value is significantly greater each round. While this offer is closer to the middle ground, accepting now would be giving up the leverage Bob has built.  He can afford to play hardball a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a win-win here. This offer considers the time remaining and gives us both a good deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his demand, but phrasing it strategically. By saying ""win-win,"" he attempts to soften the blow and make Alice feel like she is getting a fair deal.  This offer is a strong play, as it capitalizes on the time pressure while still leaving room for a counter-offer from Alice."
