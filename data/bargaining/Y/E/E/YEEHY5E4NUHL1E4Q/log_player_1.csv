"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a little bit too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob! You think you can sweet-talk me into a better deal for yourself, huh?

I'll have to think about it... 

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I want to give you 30% of the money, even if it's worth 20% less for you. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is biting, and my potential gains are worth 5% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! 55-45 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains!

But I'm not going to give in to Bob's offer just yet...

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 75% of the money, even if it's worth less than before. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating away at my potential gains now...

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
 ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, Bob. 50-50 is fair and square.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finally settle this. Your turn, Bob!"
