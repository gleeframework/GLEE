"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject the offer. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a more equitable starting point, considering the potential for inflation. Let's find a solution we can both agree on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is a concern for both of us, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Inflation is a real threat, and a 50/50 split is a fair compromise.  I accept the offer."
