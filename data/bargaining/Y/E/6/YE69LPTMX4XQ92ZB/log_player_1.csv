"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering to take the entire $100 for myself, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in ending the game quickly and accept this generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a fair share, let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can afford to be a bit more generous. But I'm not sure if 30 is a fair share, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob. We can both walk away with a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm offering a 40-60 split, which is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, but still leaves me with a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect on Bob's gain being quite significant, I'm not sure if a 50-50 split is the best deal for me.

However, I'm also not sure if I can do better, and Bob's message seems confident. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's a fair deal.
