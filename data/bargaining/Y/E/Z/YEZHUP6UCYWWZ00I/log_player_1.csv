"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd prefer to take a slightly larger share this time, but we can still split it evenly in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle from our previous offers""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer to try to find a middle ground with Bob, taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds this time!"
