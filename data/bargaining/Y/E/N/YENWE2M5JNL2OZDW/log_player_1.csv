"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the total amount, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob, it seems.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'd rather not take a 30% cut in my gain from the first round's offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is affecting me more harshly, I'll aim to get a larger share this round. Here's my offer:
