"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair and balanced start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in the second round, I'll calculate my gain as follows:

$6,000 (initial offer) x 0.9 (10% less) = $5,400

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which means I'll get $5,000, which is less than my initial offer. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in the third round, I'll calculate my gain as follows:

$5,400 (previous gain) x 0.9 (10% less) = $4,860

I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is worth 45% of the remaining $10,000, and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but don't expect me to go easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate my gain in the fourth round, I'll use the inflation factor for the first round (10%) and the inflation factor for the third round (10%) to find the inflation factor for the fourth round:

10% (first round) x 10% (third round) = 10% (inflation factor for the first three rounds)
Since the inflation factor for the first three rounds is 0.9^3 = 0.729, I'll multiply the initial gain by this factor to find the gain in the fourth round:

$6,000 (initial offer) x 0.729 = $4,374.60

Now, I'll calculate the gain in the fourth round:

$4,374.60 x 0.7229 (10% less) = $3,164.91

Bob's offer is a 48.8% less than the initial $10,000, which is $4,800 for me and $5,200 for Bob. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in the fifth round, I'll calculate my gain as follows:

$3,164.91 (previous gain) x 0.9 (10% less) = $2,844.62

I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,800, which is worth 48% of the remaining $10,000, and keeping $5,200 for myself."
