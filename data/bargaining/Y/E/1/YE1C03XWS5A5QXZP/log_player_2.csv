"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob.  A 55/45 split seems reasonable considering the inflation we face.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm losing money with every round due to inflation.  Let's be sensible and split this 50/50 before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
