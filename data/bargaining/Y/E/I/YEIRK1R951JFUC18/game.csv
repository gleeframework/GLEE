4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I think 60/40 is a bit biased. How about we do 55/45? It's more balanced.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  I understand you want a larger share, but consider the decreasing value. My 58/42 offer ensures we both get a decent amount while accounting for the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise. However, considering the inflation affects you more, I think 58/42 in my favor is more reasonable now.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  The value is slipping away with each round.  I propose a 50/50 split - let's end this and both get something substantial.",Alice,5,
