"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us receiving $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and his proposal of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for himself is too lopsided. I'd like to make a new proposal and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but not that big!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer again. His proposal of $3,500 for me and $6,500 for himself is still too lopsided, and the gap is getting wider. I'd like to make another proposal and try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's get back to an even split, it's only fair!""}

I'm proposing to go back to a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
