"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 40/60 is a more reasonable split. It's a fair compromise considering the initial offer was 75/25. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
