"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, Alice. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, and Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to consider the reduced value.

In this case, I'll get 50% of the original 100$, but since the money is worth 10% less, I'll actually get 50% of 90% of 100$, which is 0.5 * 0.9 * 100 = 45.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split considering the inflation.
