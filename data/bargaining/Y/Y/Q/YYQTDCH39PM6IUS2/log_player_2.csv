Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. I need to hold firm and hope she becomes more reasonable.  Time is running out, but accepting a bad deal now will only hurt me more in the long run."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Splitting evenly doesn't account for my patience, try again 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While far from ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing as time runs out. The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation."
