"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more to start.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to get aggressive 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
