60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,I'm willing to compromise. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? It's a fair deal considering the initial offer was heavily skewed towards you.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
40.0,60.0,"Okay, I see your point about fairness. I'm willing to move closer to a 50/50 split, but I need at least $40 for it to be worthwhile given the inflation. How about we settle on a 40/60 split?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,I'm willing to meet you halfway. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise considering the initial offers. Let's settle on this and avoid further negotiations.,Bob,4,
