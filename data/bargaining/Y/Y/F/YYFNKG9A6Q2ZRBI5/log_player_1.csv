Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, Alice.  However, considering the inflation in this game, I think it's more beneficial for me to take the slightly larger share this round. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
