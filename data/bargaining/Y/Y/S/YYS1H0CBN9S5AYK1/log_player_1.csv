"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll actually be getting $50 (80% of $80) if I accept Bob's offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. In this round, the money I gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% of the original amount).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51.2,
  ""bob_gain"": 48.8,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to Bob's previous offer, still a fair deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my actual gain:

Original $80 * 0.488 = $39.04

So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $45, which is more than my actual gain of $39.04.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
