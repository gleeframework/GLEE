7000.0,3000.0,I propose we divide the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair balance considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the decreasing value of money and gives us both a fair share.,Bob,2,
