"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, considering I'm the first to make the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is trying to get a 50-50 split, but considering the inflation effect, I'm actually getting a slightly better deal than in the first round. I'll take it.
