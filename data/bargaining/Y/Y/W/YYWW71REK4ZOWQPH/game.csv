6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple split, Bob. I take $6,000, you take $4,000.  It's a fair deal that avoids too much risk from inflation later on.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the risk of inflation and that I'm giving you a chance to avoid further loss of value.",Bob,2,
,,"Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I think we can still find something a bit more balanced. The inflation risk cuts both ways.",Alice,2,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Okay Bob, how about a compromise? $5,400 for me and $4,600 for you.  We're losing money every round, so let's settle this fairly.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Considering we've both shown we're willing to take some risk and with the increasing loss from inflation, I think this split is more reasonable now.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but that offer is getting too far into your favor. We need to find a truly balanced solution, otherwise this won't work.",Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking and we both lose if this drags on. I'm offering $5,200 for me and $4,800 for you.  It's a small concession on my part, but fair given the circumstances. Don't let greed ruin a good deal!",Alice,5,
