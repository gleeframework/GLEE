Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know inflation is eating away, but I'm willing to take the risk for a better deal. 58-42 is my new offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer is only slightly worse than my last one, I'm betting she'll crack and offer something closer to 50-50 in the next round to avoid losing even more value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. Inflation is killing your end of this deal. I'm offering a straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but it's the best you'll get at this point.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. Offering a 50/50 split might seem generous, but it's the strongest move strategically. 

* **Time pressure:**  Every round makes a difference to Alice.
* **Anchoring:** I'm establishing 50/50 as the new baseline.  It's unlikely she'll get a better offer from me now.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A 50/50 split guarantees me a good amount. It's not worth risking further rounds for a potentially insignificant gain."
