"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also ready to negotiate further if he's not satisfied!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal. You can't get it all, after all! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better than 30. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping for a bit more. I'll try to do better next time.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth even less now. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 56, and you can have 44. It's a fair split, considering the value of the money is decreasing.""
}
```"
