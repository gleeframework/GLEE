"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 55/45 split seems like a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
It's a decent offer, but I can likely do better. I'll see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering we both have to work towards an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be realistic. This is a negotiation and time is literally money, especially for you.  I'm moving closer to a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to my position, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing."
