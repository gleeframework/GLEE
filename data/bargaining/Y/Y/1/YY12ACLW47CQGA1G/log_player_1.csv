"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiation""
}
```

I'm making a fair and equal offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get our share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the inflation effect on Bob's gain. If I accept this offer, Bob will get $6000, which is worth 20% less than the $7500 he would have gotten in the first round. That's still a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting desperate yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this new offer from Bob. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the inflation effect on Bob's gain. If I accept this offer, Bob will get $5500, which is worth 48.8% less than the $10,750 he would have gotten in the first round. That's a significant drop in value.

However, I'm not sure if I should hold out for a better offer. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and I might end up with a smaller share.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best deal I'll get.
