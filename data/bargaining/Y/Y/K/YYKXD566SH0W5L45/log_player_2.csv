"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""I propose a more equitable split considering the inflation. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice's share is devaluing faster than Bob's.  She's more incentivized to take a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Slight Edge:** Bob's offer is slightly in his favor, but not drastically so. This makes it more likely Alice will accept, knowing that further delays hurt her more.
* **Finality:**  Adding ""This is my final offer"" introduces a sense of urgency and may push Alice to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal in a future round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Declining Value:** The money is losing value quickly.  While not ideal, accepting now avoids further losses for Bob.
* **Improved Offer:** Alice's offer is better than her initial 60/40 split. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  If Bob rejects, there's no guarantee he can get a better deal in a subsequent round. Alice might propose something worse, and Bob's position weakens with each round."
