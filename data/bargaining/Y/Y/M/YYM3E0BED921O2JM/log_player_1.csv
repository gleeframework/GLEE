"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll take less to get it over with.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which I think is a generous starting point. The message is a friendly nudge to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous, I'll try to get more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being aggressive!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, I'd be getting $300,000, which is worth 95% of $300,000 from the original $1,000,000, or approximately $285,000.

Bob's offer is a significant increase from his initial proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the current $1,000,000, which is worth 90% of the original $1,000,000 due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate!

Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain in this round is $450,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 85.74% of the original $300,000 from the previous round, or approximately $257,122.
