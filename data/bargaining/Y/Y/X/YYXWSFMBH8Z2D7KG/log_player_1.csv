I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give $1,000 to Bob.  I'm hoping this will be a fair starting point for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
