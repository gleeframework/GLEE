I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000.  Let's see if he's feeling generous!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

I'm going to try to be a bit more assertive this time. The inflation is making the money worth less for me, so I need to get a better deal. I'm offering $8000 for myself and $2000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm still going to reject. While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, I'm hoping that Bob will eventually realize he needs to offer me more if he wants to avoid another round. I'm not going to give in to his greed just yet."

Round 5

Inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I'm not giving up yet. I'm offering $7000 for myself and $3000 for Bob. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 7000

It's painful to take such a small share, but the inflation is killing me. This offer is better than nothing, and I can't afford to keep playing. I'm accepting."
