Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about time value, but I still feel a 65/35 split is too uneven. Let's compromise at 60/40. This way, we both get a fair share, and we don't risk losing everything with more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily weighted in her favor. Given the faster rate of inflation on her end, she's feeling the pressure to close a deal. Holding out a bit longer could lead to a much more favorable outcome for Bob."
