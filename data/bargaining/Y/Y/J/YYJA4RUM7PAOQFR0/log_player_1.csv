"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I think I should take the offer. Here's my decision:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
