"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. I'll give you $1000 and take $9000. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a small amount to get him started, and I take the majority of the money to set a strong foundation for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split the money more evenly.  This way we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split yet, especially since I'm still recovering from the initial loss of 10% due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you $3500 and take $6500. This way, I still get a bit more, but you get a decent amount too.""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my desire for a larger share with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice.  This offer is still fair to you, and it gives me a better share than the last offer.  Let's end this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

However, I'm not convinced that this offer is any better than my previous offer, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better split.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, Bob. I'll take $7000 and you can have $3000. This is my last offer, I'm not going any lower.""

```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this offer, as I'm running out of time and I want to maximize my gain."

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint. I'd like to try to get a better deal, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round."

  ""message"": ""I'm making a final push, Bob. I'll take $7500 and you can have $2500. This is my last and best offer.""
}

# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 47.83% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not convinced that this offer is the best I can get. I'd like to try to squeeze out a bit more.

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round."

  ""message"": ""This is my last chance, Bob. I'll take $8000 and you can have $2000. If you don't accept, we'll both walk away with nothing.""
}
```

I'm making a very aggressive offer, taking 80% of the remaining money. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as I'm not sure if I can do better at this point."
