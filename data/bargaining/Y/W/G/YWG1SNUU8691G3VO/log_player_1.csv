"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'll take $600,000. I believe this is a fair division, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and reason. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than last time. This offer is still generous. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Although the amount he's offering me is still significant, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'd like to try to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
