I'm starting with a very generous offer, aiming for a quick and easy win.  This way, I get the most money possible while still ensuring Bob gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is tempting, but I still believe I can get more.  Even though the money is worth less now, I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still leaving a good chunk for Bob. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him before the inflation gets too extreme."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though inflation is starting to bite, I'm still not happy with this offer.  I'm confident that I can get more in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I still believe I can secure a decent share of the money.  With the inflation starting to take hold, it's time to be a little more flexible, but not give in completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lopsided, but I'm still holding out.  The inflation is hurting, but I'm not willing to accept such a drastically uneven split yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is getting serious. I need to be realistic, so I'm proposing an even split. This is the best chance to secure a decent amount of money before we both lose everything."
