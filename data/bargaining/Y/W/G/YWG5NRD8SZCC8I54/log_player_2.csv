"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of you, Bob. This might seem like a generous offer considering the risk of inflation, but remember, in the next round, the value of money decreases by 20%. I hope you find this proposal fair. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept, it's better to see what Alice offers in the next round.  There's a chance she might offer a better deal, especially if she doesn't know about the inflation affecting you."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 80/20 in my favor. It's a fair deal given the potential of inflation. We can both still get a decent amount.""}
