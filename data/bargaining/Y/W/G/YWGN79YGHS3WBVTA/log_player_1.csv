"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Since the money's value decreases for me with each round, I want to get a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. If not, we'll proceed to the next round, and Bob will make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a good deal in the early rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 40 dollars in the second round means I'm actually getting less value than if I had accepted a similar offer in the first round. Since the money's value decreases by 10% each round for me, I'm motivated to try and get a better deal in the next round or hope that Bob will increase his offer to me in subsequent rounds. I'm also taking into account that we have 10 more rounds to negotiate, so there's still plenty of time to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an offer that slightly adjusts my initial proposal to show that I'm willing to compromise but still want to account for the inflation affecting my share. Since the value of the money decreases for me with each round, I'm hoping Bob will understand my position and consider accepting this offer.\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to concede a little to avoid further inflation. This offer is fair considering the current circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer in round 4 because, despite his slight concession, the offer doesn't adequately account for the 27.1% decrease in value I've experienced due to inflation. Accepting 45 dollars now would mean I'm getting significantly less value than what I would have received in the initial rounds. Given that we still have 8 rounds left, I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, Bob will understand the impact of inflation on my share and be willing to make a more substantial concession in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the value of the money continues to decrease for me due to inflation, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Considering Bob's last offer was 45 for me and 55 for him, I'll try to find a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of my share. I'll propose a division that slightly increases Bob's share while still aiming to maximize my gain, given the circumstances.\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, accounting for inflation""}\n\nI hope this offer will be more appealing to Bob, as it shows I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground, despite the negative impact of inflation on my share.###"
