"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at the start of the game."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, I'm now considering the reduced value of the money. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. My goal is to maximize my share, and I think I can do better than this.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 25% less than in the first round. I'll take this into account when making my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll consider Bob's new offer carefully.

However, I think I can still do better than this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Considering the significant difference in the amount I'd gain compared to Bob, I think I should take this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing.
