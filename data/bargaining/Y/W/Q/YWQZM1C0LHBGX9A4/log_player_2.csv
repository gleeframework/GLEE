"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth seeing what Alice will offer next.  The inflation is likely to be a bigger factor for her than for me, so I might be able to get a better deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm hoping the inflation will make Alice more likely to accept a smaller share than in the previous round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is better than what I could get in the next round, and I'm unsure how inflation will affect her future offers.  While 500,000 is less than what I initially wanted, it's still a decent sum, especially after the inflation hit."
