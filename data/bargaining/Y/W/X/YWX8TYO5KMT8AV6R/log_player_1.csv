"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth even less now. I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept this offer.
