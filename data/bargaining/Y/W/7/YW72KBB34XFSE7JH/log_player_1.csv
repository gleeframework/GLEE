"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the original, so I'll get 90% of $2,000, which is $1,800.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. You can try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I'm still getting the short end of the stick. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of the original, so I'll get 72.9% of $4,000, which is approximately $2,916.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
