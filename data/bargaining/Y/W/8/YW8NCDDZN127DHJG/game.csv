9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair offer. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly.  This way we both get a decent share.,Bob,2,

7000.0,3000.0,"Let's try this again. I'll take 70% this time, but I think it's a good deal for both of us, considering inflation is eating into our potential gains.  We need to find a solution before it's too late!",Alice,5,
