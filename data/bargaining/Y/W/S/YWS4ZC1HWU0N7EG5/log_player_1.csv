Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is fair, acknowledging your risk distribution argument while giving me a larger share for my effort in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
