I'm going to be greedy and try to get the majority of the money right away, but I'm still giving Bob a decent share.  I think it's a fair offer for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject this offer and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to account for inflation, but I'm still offering a significant amount.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
