"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with $8,000. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and end the game 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
* Bob gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
