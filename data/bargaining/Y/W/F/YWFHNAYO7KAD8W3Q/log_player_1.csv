"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25

I'm not sure I like the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a better offer than the 20/80 split from the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
