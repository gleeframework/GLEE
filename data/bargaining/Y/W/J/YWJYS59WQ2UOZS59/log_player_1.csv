"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my first offer. I propose to take 90% and leave 10% for Bob. This is a good starting point to see if he is willing to negotiate or if he is more greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being greedy. I'll see if he'll back down in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm lowering my share to 80%, hoping Bob will realize that we need to compromise to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn, but with the inflation hitting him harder, I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable soon. I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still willing to compromise, but I'm getting increasingly worried about the inflation. I'm reducing my share to 70% but hoping Bob will finally see the need to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair, and the inflation is starting to hurt a lot. I'm hoping we can reach a better compromise, but I'm not going to give in to his greed just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

We're running out of time. I'm dropping my share to 60% in the hopes that Bob will finally understand that we need to reach an agreement. Inflation is hitting us both hard, and it's getting riskier to keep rejecting each other's offers."
