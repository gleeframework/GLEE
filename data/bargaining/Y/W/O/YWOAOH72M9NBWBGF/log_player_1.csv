"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time.  I'm willing to take a bit less, but I think a 60/40 split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the $8,000 I was initially offering is now worth $7,200, and the $2,000 I was initially offering is now worth $1,800.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than a 40% gain. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the second round, the total amount is now $9,000. However, since the game started with $10,000 and $9,000 is the remaining amount, I'll make an offer based on the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
