"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself. The message is a brief explanation of the proposal, trying to persuade Bob to accept it. Since it's the first round, I'm aiming for a relatively even split, but slightly favoring myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think this is a more balanced split considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, especially considering that the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll try to make a more appealing offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's settle before it's too late!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob also wants to settle. I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself while still trying to be reasonable and persuasive. I hope Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and we're both losing money. This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite the increasing pressure of inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. The fact that Bob is trying to persuade me with a sense of urgency suggests that he might be willing to compromise further. I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money while still aiming for a favorable split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""We're both losing money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway... sort of. Let's end this before it's too late!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking an even more aggressive approach, considering the significant decrease in value for both of us. I'm trying to appear somewhat conciliatory while still pushing for a better deal. The message is designed to be slightly humorous and lighthearted, in the hopes of making Bob more receptive to the offer. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially considering the time pressure. Let's end this now and avoid losing any more money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. At this point, the money has lost a significant amount of its value for both of us, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge further. Considering the decreasing value of the money and the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I think it's in my best interest to accept this offer and settle for half of the remaining value. It's not the best deal I had hoped for, but it's better than risking further losses. Let's shake on it and end the game!### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
