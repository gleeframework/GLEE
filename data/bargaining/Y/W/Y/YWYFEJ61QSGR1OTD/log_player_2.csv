"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  This benefits us both as we avoid the money devaluating. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can find a better balance. Since the money devalues less for me, I'll take a bit more to compensate for the risk of further rounds. Let's try 55-45 and save our money from inflation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the faster rate of inflation for me. Let's be reasonable: I'll take a slight reduction to $58, leaving you with $42. This way, we both benefit significantly compared to further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think we can find a better compromise, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your end, I'm willing to adjust my proposal. A 52-48 split seems more reasonable, as it acknowledges the devaluation risk for both of us. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast.  My previous offer was already a compromise. I'm willing to adjust slightly further to $56 for me and $44 for you. This is my final offer; let's agree now and walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, especially on Alice's end, and considering we're already at Round 5 with 7 rounds left, I believe accepting this offer is the wisest decision. The risk of the money devaluing further outweighs the potential benefits of negotiating for a slightly larger share."
