Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better balance. Since the money devalues less for me, I'll take a bit more to compensate for the risk of further rounds. Let's try 55-45 and save our money from inflation! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the faster rate of inflation for me. Let's be reasonable: I'll take a slight reduction to $58, leaving you with $42. This way, we both benefit significantly compared to further rounds.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your end, I'm willing to adjust my proposal. A 52-48 split seems more reasonable, as it acknowledges the devaluation risk for both of us. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value!
