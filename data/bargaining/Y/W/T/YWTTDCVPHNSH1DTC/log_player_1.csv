{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I've reached the point where I'm willing to accept any amount of money, no matter how small, rather than going to zero. At this point, the value of the money is so low that it's almost meaningless, and I'd rather take the $1000 than nothing."
