"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 600,000$ is now worth 480,000$. Bob's offer of 300,000$ is a significant reduction from my initial proposal, but I'll have to consider it carefully.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to maximize my share while minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting my offer. Since my offer from Round 1 was rejected, I'll try to make a more favorable offer to myself this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself, trying to balance the risk of rejection with the desire to maximize my gain."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 600,000$ from the first round is now worth 388,800$. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept it.

Since my offer from Round 3 was rejected, and this offer is even more favorable to Bob, I'll reject it again.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation has taken a significant toll, and my 550,000$ from Round 3 is now worth 276,400$. I need to be more cautious with my next offer to ensure I don't lose out on a good opportunity.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
