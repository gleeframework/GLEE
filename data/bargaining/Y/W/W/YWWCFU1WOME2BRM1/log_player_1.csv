"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, it's just the first round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. This way, we can both get a decent share and still have room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair - I'll take slightly more, but I'm still open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 45 * 0.95 = 42.75
* Bob gain: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25

I'm not too thrilled about giving up a larger share, but Bob's message suggests he's open to negotiation, so I'll try to make a counteroffer. I'll reject this offer and propose a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a bit more. Let's try 50-50.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""50-50 split, let's call it a draw!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair considering the previous offers and the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
