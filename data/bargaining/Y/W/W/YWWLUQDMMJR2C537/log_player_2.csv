**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of the money decreases for her. While her offer isn't terrible, I believe I can push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds.  I need to convey a sense of urgency to Alice so she doesn't let this drag on for too long."
