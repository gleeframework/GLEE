"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation.  Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the offer from Bob is actually a bit more favorable to me than the initial one. I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
