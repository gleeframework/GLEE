Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, but let's finish this quickly. I'm losing out with every round. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5463.75,
""bob_gain"": 4536.25,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Let's be reasonable and avoid further losses from inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the game's dynamics, even though he doesn't experience inflation.  He wants to end the game quickly. This round, I'm aiming for a slightly more aggressive offer than my initial one, capitalizing on his impatience.  By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal that he won't get a better deal and should settle now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, it's the best you'll get. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is now better than what I offered in Round 3 due to inflation. If I reject this, there's a good chance he will offer even less in the next round, and the inflation will continue to eat away at my potential gains. It's time to cut my losses and secure a reasonable, if not optimal, outcome."
