"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll consider the effective values.

My gain of 5000 is worth 95% of the original 6000, which is 5700. Bob's gain of 5000 is worth 95% of the original 4000, which is 3800.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the original proposal I made was 6000 for me and 4000 for Bob. I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is worth 10% less than in the second round (5% less than the first round), I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the $10,000, and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the cumulative inflation:

Round 1: 100% (initial)
Round 2: 95% (5% less)
Round 3: 95% * 95% = 90.25% (10% less)
Round 4: 90.25% * 95.74% (14.26% less) = 86.36%

My gain of 4500 is worth 86.36% of the original 6000, which is approximately 5176.16. Bob's gain of 5500 is worth 86.36% of the original 4000, which is approximately 4928.84.

Considering the original proposal I made was 6000 for me and 4000 for Bob, and the current offer is 5176.16 for me and 4928.84 for Bob, I think this offer is more favorable to me. I'll accept it.
