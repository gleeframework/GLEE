Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal. I'm assuming Bob is also aware of inflation, and might be willing to accept a smaller share to avoid the risk of it worsening."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a more even split, I'm still losing value due to inflation.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower split than my first round offer, acknowledging the inflation.  However, I'm still keeping a majority of the money. I'm hoping that Bob, facing his own inflation, will be willing to take this offer to avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While the inflation is significant, I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round.  I'm hoping to leverage the fact that Bob's inflation is less severe than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

At this point, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  I'm offering a 50/50 split to avoid further losses and hopefully secure a deal."
