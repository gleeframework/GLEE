Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. I'm not happy with the 55/45 split, especially since the money is now worth less for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'll take a slight loss, but I think a 52/48 split is a fairer offer, considering the inflation. What do you say?""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this inflation is hurting you more than me. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but 52/48 is still not good enough. Let's do 53/47. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, considering the inflation, it's a better deal than what I'm likely to get in the following rounds."
