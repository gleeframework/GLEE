,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
52.0,48.0,"Let's compromise. I'll take a slight loss, but I think a 52/48 split is a fairer offer, considering the inflation. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
47.0,53.0,"Alice, this inflation is hurting you more than me. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but 52/48 is still not good enough. Let's do 53/47.",Bob,4,
