"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this is a reasonable starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal given Alice's greater inflation disadvantage.  I'll propose something in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest, given the inflation factors we're facing.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split isn't fair to me with the faster inflation. This is my counter-offer, let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would still prefer a 50/50 split, Alice's inflation disadvantage is substantial. Accepting this offer will secure me a decent amount, and the risk of further rounds is too high."
