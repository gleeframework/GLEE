"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$, which is a fair share, considering I'm taking the larger portion. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 300,000 is actually 270,000 in real terms.

I don't think I'm being too greedy, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
