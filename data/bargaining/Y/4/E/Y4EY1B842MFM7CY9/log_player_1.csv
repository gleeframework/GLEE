"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority share""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller majority, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, and 40% of the remaining $10,000 (after the 10% inflation) is not enough for me. I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000 and Bob gets 40%. I'm trying to compromise and give Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but I still think I deserve the majority share. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. 45% of the remaining $10,000 is a decent share, and I'm not sure I can do much better at this point. I'll take the deal and end the game."
