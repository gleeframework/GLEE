# Bob gain: 70

This is a tough situation. While ideally, I'd want a more significant portion of the money, I have to consider that:

* **The value is rapidly decreasing for me.**  With each round, my potential gain is shrinking significantly. Waiting any longer is likely to result in an even worse outcome. 
* **Bob is unlikely to budge much further.**  He's clearly aware of the inflation working in his favor and is pushing for the best possible deal for himself.

Accepting a 30/70 split is far from ideal, but rejecting it risks getting an even smaller share in the next round. It's a gamble, and at this point, cutting my losses is the most logical choice."
