"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'm also confident I can get a better deal in the future if you reject this. Let's make this quick. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, rejecting and forcing her to make a new offer in the next round could lead to a better deal for Bob. The threat of inflation and the diminishing value of money are key factors in this game.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. We both know the money loses value with each round. This offer is fair and allows us to both get a decent amount. Let's not risk losing it all.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal if we continue. This is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get a better deal for myself. By rejecting this offer, I can force Alice to make another offer in the next round. The pressure of inflation and the decreasing value of the money will likely force her to make a more favorable offer to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. This offer is fair and allows us to both get a significant amount.  Let's end this now and avoid further losses.""
