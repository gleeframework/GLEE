Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a small hit to end this now.  Agree and we both win. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, which means time is on my side. While his offer isn't terrible, I'm still in a strong position to push for a better deal.  The longer this goes on, the more his share decreases in value for him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a way out.  This is the same split you wanted last round, only now *I'm* taking the 'small hit'. Time to be reasonable.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mirroring:** By mirroring Bob's previous offer, I'm highlighting the impact of his stalling. He wanted 52 in the last round, but now that same 52 is worth less to him.
* **Pressure:** This puts the pressure on him to accept a less favorable deal than he could have had before.  
* **Slight Concession:** While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by slightly decreasing my demand."
