Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll make a proposal that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Alice's offer is more generous than her previous one, I'll consider it a good opportunity to end the game. I'll accept her offer.
