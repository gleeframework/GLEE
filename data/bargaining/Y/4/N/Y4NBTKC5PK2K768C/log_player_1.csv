"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, my effective gain from Bob's offer would be 30 * 0.8 = 24. 

I'll reject this offer. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
