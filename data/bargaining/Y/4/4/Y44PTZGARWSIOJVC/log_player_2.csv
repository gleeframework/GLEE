{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 55/45 split. I'm proposing we go for 60/40, giving you a bit more to make up for the inflation you'll be facing in the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a more balanced approach.  I propose we split the money equally at 50/50. We both face inflation, and this way we can maximize our gains before it gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
