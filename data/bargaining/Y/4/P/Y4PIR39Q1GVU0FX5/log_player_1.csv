Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he'll accept a good deal right away, or if he'll try to negotiate.  Since I'm losing 5% of my share each round, I'm trying to minimize the number of rounds to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's not as good as my initial proposal, it's still a decent amount of money, and I'm losing value with every passing round. It's better to take a fair deal now than risk losing more."
