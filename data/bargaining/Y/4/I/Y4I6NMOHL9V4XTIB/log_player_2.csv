Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, this is as low as I'll go 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal,  it's better than nothing considering the inflation.  Accepting ends the game and allows Bob to gain something, however small."
