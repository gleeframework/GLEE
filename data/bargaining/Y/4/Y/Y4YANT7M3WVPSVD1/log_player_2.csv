Alice's offer:

``` 

This offer is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I need to get a better share than the previous offer. Let's work together to find a fair deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better share, but I need to be cautious with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is a slight improvement from the first round, and considering the inflation, it's a good deal for me. I'll accept it."
