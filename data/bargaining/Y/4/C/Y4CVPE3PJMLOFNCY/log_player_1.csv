"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's avoid going through too many rounds to save money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is for an even split, I'll have to consider it carefully. However, I'd like to negotiate a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous for Bob. I'd like to see a slightly more favorable split for me.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet, but I'm open to further negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this split is more reasonable. It's still a fair compromise, but slightly more in my favor.""
}
```"
