"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a reasonable starting point and avoid any aggressive negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be careful. Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can do better in future rounds.
