"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $10,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob wants to meet in the middle, but at the cost of me getting only $3,000, which is worth 30% of the original $10,000 due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, so it's worth 27% of the original $10,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2700,
  ""bob_gain"": 7300,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much. You're getting a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm not getting taken advantage of.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my previous one, but I'm still trying to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much of the pie. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 4, the money I gain is worth 27.1% of the original $10,000, which is approximately $2,710.

I'll consider Bob's new offer. He's offering me $4,500, which is worth around $4,500, a significant increase from my previous offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get.

I'll accept this offer.
