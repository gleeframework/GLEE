Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer, especially considering Bob's money is worth significantly less in each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I propose a 85/15 split in my favor. While Bob's money is losing value faster than mine, this is still a fair offer considering the rounds are ticking away."

# Bob gain: 60

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher share, but with the inflation biting into both our gains, I'm willing to compromise slightly.  This 80/20 split is still favorable for me, but also gives Bob a decent amount to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is getting closer to even, and with the inflation rate increasing so quickly, it's not worth risking getting nothing in the end."
