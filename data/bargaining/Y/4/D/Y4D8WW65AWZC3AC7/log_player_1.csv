I'm going to propose a very unfair division in my favor. Since I'm the one who gets to keep 80% of the value of the money in every round, it's in my best interest to grab as much as possible right away.  Bob can either accept this tiny amount, or he can risk it all in the next round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation. I'll take the 500,000."
