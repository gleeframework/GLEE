"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, before inflation significantly impacts my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, it's still not a good deal for me. With 10 rounds left, there's still plenty of time for me to negotiate a more equitable split. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to compromise a bit more, offering 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, as it's still a significant amount for him while being a more equitable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting more and more favorable to him, it's still not enough for me.  I'm going to keep rejecting and aiming for a more even split. There's still time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split this time. The inflation is impacting both of us now, and this is the fairest way to split the money at this point."
