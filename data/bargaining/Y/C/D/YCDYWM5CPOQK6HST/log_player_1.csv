"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair start, but I'm really trying to get the higher amount to account for the inflation that will be coming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm still trying to get a good deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle is a reasonable proposal, but I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You said meet in the middle, but I think I deserve more. I'm willing to give you 60%!""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposal to $6,000, and offering Bob $4,000. I'm framing it as a compromise, but really I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing it, Alice, I'm not going to give up that much! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. I was hoping to get more, but I think $3,000 is better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less valuable money. I'll just have to hope that Bob will regret this decision later."
