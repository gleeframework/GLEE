Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  I figure this is a good starting point, as I get the lion's share, but Bob still gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'm getting a much smaller share than my initial proposal, it's still a significant amount of money. The inflation factor is a big consideration, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
