Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy approach in the first round.  Since I don't know how Bob will perceive inflation, I'll offer him the bare minimum and see what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the 20% inflation, a 500,000 gain is better than nothing. It's a much fairer offer than the first round, and I don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting."
