Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This reflects the time pressure we both face, and frankly, your initial offer was laughable.  Take this deal now, or the next one will be even less appealing.

# Bob gain: 700000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking, and frankly, your stalling tactics are tiresome. I'm offering you 400,000 - a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and the fact that your potential gains are diminishing faster than mine. Let's close this deal now and avoid further losses.

# Bob gain: 600000
