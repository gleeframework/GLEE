"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but your offer is still too far off.  I'm willing to compromise further, proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it's also a fair reflection of the value we both bring to this agreement. Let's settle this before further inflation erodes our gains. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

I'm offering you 400,000 - a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and the fact that your potential gains are diminishing faster than mine. Let's close this deal now and avoid further losses.""}
