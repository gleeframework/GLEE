"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob is proposing a 60-40 split, but this time he's offering me $4,000 and taking $6,000, I'm not thrilled about it. I was hoping for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise with a 55-45 split. Let's make a deal!""}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate further if needed."
