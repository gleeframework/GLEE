"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Bob's offer is quite skewed towards his favor.

I reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher share to maintain the purchasing power of my gain. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
