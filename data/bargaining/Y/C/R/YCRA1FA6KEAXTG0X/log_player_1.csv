"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's start with a balanced split!""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more equal split this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be more generous!

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. It's a fair and reasonable proposal, and I'm happy to split the money evenly.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
