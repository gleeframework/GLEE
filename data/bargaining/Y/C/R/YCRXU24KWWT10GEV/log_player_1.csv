"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start. This is a risky strategy, as he might reject it. However, if he does, the money will be worth less to him in the next round, making him more likely to accept a smaller share later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than my initial offer, and worse for me. I'm going to reject it, hoping he will be more willing to compromise in the next round. The inflation is starting to impact Bob, which is a factor in my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. Since he rejected my previous offer, he's likely to be more willing to compromise, and the inflation is making the money worth less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively better for him, but I'm still going to reject it.  The inflation is starting to really hurt him now, so I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than my previous offer but still keeping a substantial portion for myself. The inflation is severely affecting Bob, and I'm hoping he will be more inclined to accept this offer to secure some money before it loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. The inflation is severely impacting Bob, and his offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split.  While I would prefer a larger share, I'm concerned that rejecting this offer will lead to a situation where both of us get nothing. It's better to secure some money now than risk losing everything later."
