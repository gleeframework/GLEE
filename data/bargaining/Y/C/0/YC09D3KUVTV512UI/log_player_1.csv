"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll regret rejecting 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'll regret it, huh?

Considering the inflation effect, I'm now worth 5% less than before, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less than before. This offer is still skewed towards Bob, but not as extreme as the first round.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. A slight edge for me, but still a fair deal""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing your luck, Alice. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go easy on you 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at my potential gains!

Considering the drastic reduction in value, Bob's offer is actually a decent one, considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
