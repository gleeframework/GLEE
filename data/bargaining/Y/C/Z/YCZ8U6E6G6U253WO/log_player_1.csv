"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10.  I figure it's a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a major factor. Getting 50% of the money, even with the devaluation, is better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
