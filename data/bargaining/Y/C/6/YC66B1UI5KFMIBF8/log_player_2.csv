Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a bit, Bob.  Let's try this, and avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  We're both losing money with each round. This is a fair offer, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, accepting $40 now is better than getting $0 later. However, I'm banking on Alice cracking under the time pressure. I'll hold out for one more round to see if I can get a better offer, knowing that if I have to propose in Round 6, I'll need to offer something acceptable to avoid losing everything."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option here.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  

Time pressure is now the biggest factor. While I'd prefer a better split, offering anything less than 50/50 to Alice is highly likely to be rejected. That would leave me with only one more chance to propose in round 8, with even less value for me due to inflation. A 50/50 split, even with the inflation hit, is better than risking a $0 outcome."
