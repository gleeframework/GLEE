Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large portion of the money. I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal to get only 50%, it's a significant improvement from the previous offer.  Considering the inflation, it's better to accept and secure some gain rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
