"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very close to even split, but I'll give Bob $1 just to make sure he'll accept it. I'm hoping he doesn't realize how quickly the inflation will work in my favor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Even though Bob's offer is much more even than my previous one, I know that if I reject it, the inflation will work in my favor. I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a much smaller share this time, hoping he'll take it rather than risk getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Even though I'm losing money, I know that I'll get an even worse deal if I accept. It's better to hold out and see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping he'll see that he's not going to get a better deal if he keeps rejecting.  I'm also hoping he's starting to get frustrated with the game and will just take what he can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 125000 
# Bob gain: 875000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer is not ideal, but the inflation is hitting me hard. It's better to take this than risk getting an even worse offer in the next round. I'm going to have to accept this and hope for a better result in the future."
