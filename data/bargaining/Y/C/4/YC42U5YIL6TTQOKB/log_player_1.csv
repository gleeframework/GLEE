"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split is more equitable.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal! Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather not accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, Bob! I'm offering you a slightly smaller share this time. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a smaller share than before, but still a fair deal considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split is the fairest way to account for the inflation we're both facing. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really trying to take advantage of the inflation now! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less, I'd rather not accept this offer.

}
