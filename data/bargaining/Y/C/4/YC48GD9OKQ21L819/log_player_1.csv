Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer.  Since we have 12 rounds, I want to get as much as possible early on.  I'm hoping Bob will see that the inflation is going to affect him too, and might accept even a small amount to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. The inflation is likely to have a bigger impact on Bob in the coming rounds, and I can leverage that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try to get a larger share again, but I'm also acknowledging the inflation that is affecting Bob. I'm hoping that by offering him a decent amount, he'll realize that he's better off taking what he can get rather than risking getting nothing at all."
