"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible offer. While it is technically a gain for Bob, it's not worth it at all. Bob should reject and hope for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer still heavily favors Alice, it's a significant improvement from the previous round. With inflation reducing the value of Bob's potential gains, accepting this offer guarantees some money. It's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
