"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split just yet. I want to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 90% of what it was in round 1, so I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm proposing a 48/52 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up with us!

With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was initially. Considering Bob's offer, I think I should accept it to avoid losing more value.

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the 300,000."
