"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it more evenly, this time with a slight advantage for me to account for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to adjust my proposal to account for it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still not fair, I want a bit more""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet, and I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
