I'm going for a large share, but I want to make sure Bob has something to motivate him to accept the offer.  Let's see what he thinks!"

I'm lowering my share slightly, but still offering a decent amount to Bob.  He might be more likely to accept this time, since he saw how much he could lose in the last round."

Bob is getting greedy again! I'm going to reject this offer. It's still too risky to accept a small share so early in the game.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."

Bob is still trying to get the bigger share. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. It's starting to get risky though.  We're getting close to the end of the game."

I'm taking another big step down to offer Bob a larger share.  We're nearing the end, and I need to find a compromise to avoid getting nothing at all."
