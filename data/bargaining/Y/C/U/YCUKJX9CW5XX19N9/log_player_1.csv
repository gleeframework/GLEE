"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a very straightforward split.  I'll take the lion's share, but I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid any potential inflation issues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt, and this is a decent split. It's worth taking the sure thing now."
