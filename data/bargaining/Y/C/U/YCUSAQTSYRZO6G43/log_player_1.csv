"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split, considering we're both starting from the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'll give you a smaller one this time. You can try to negotiate next round if you want more. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $2000 is actually worth 90% of $2000, which is $1800. Bob's gain of $8000 is worth 95% of $8000, which is $7600.

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'll try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 80-20 split. I was thinking more along the lines of 55-45 or 52-48. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of $1800, which is $1620. Bob's gain is now worth 95% of $7600, which is $7220.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm offering you 4500, and I'll take 5500. It's a bit more in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share again, but I'm willing to give you a bit more this time. Don't expect me to give up much more, though. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game continues!

Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $4000 is worth 72.9% of $6000 (initial amount), which is $4374.4.
Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 85.74% of $10,000 (initial amount), which is $8500.

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'll think about it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll think about it, but I'm not ready to accept this offer. Can you meet me at 50-50 or slightly better?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
