I propose taking $9,000 for myself and giving $1,000 to Bob.  This is a fairly generous offer, but I want to secure a good portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split is tempting, I believe I can do better.  I'll reject this offer and see what Bob proposes next round."

# Alice gain: 2000

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair.  He's attempting to take nearly all of the money while I'm left with a tiny pittance. I'm not going to be bullied into accepting this. Inflation is hitting him hard, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."

```

This is a terrible deal.  I'm not going to accept this.  The money I would receive is almost worthless at this point due to inflation.  Even though we're out of rounds, I'm not going to let Bob bully me into this.  We both get nothing, but I'm not going to cave to his unfair demands."
