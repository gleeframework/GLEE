"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $1,000 and take $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll consider the actual amounts as follows:

* My gain: $5,000 / 0.8 = $6,250
* Bob's gain: $5,000 / 0.8 = $6,250

I accept this offer.
