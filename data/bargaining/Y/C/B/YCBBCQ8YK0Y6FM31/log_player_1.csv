Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money, which is a generous offer considering I have the first move. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

```
