I'm going for a very aggressive opening offer. Since the money is losing value quickly, I want to get as much as possible in the first round.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor. There's a high chance Bob will reject any offer that favors me more, and we'll both get nothing by the end. Accepting this guarantees a decent chunk of the money."
