"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a small share, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 20% loss in value of the money I'd gain, but I'm willing to consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains, and I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle. No more taking risks!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept a more equal division of the remaining funds."
