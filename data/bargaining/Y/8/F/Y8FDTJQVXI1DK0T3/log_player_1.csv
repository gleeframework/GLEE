"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10. This is a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority share while still offering Bob a small amount to consider. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I'm offering Bob $20, which is double what he got in the first round.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being incredibly stubborn. While the offer is slightly better, I'm not going to give in to his demands just yet. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal.  I'm going to keep rejecting these unreasonable offers!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not going to cave in completely.  I'm offering Bob $30, which is a significant increase from his previous offers, but still leaves me with the majority.  Hopefully, he will see this as a reasonable compromise."

Bob's greed is getting out of hand.  He's clearly not willing to compromise, so I'm not going to accept his offer. I'm still confident I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm feeling the pressure now, but I'm still holding out for a decent share.  I'm offering Bob $40, which is a significant increase from his previous offers. This is my last attempt to reach a compromise before the inflation really starts to bite."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable. While the offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a fairer deal. I refuse to let his greed dictate the outcome. I'm confident I can still negotiate a better outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're both running out of time, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  It's time to compromise. I'm proposing an even split of the money, 50/50. It's the fairest solution at this point, and hopefully, Bob will see that too."
