"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, giving me $9,000 and Bob $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $8,000 is worth 90% of its original value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
