"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's $320,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's $540,000.

I'll reject this offer. My goal is to maximize my share, and this offer doesn't give me a good enough deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%), so it's $256,000. I'll make a new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values:

My gain of $400,000 in the first round is now worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8%), so it's approximately $204,800.

Bob's gain of $600,000 in the first round is now worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1%), so it's approximately $437,400.

I'll reject this offer. I'm not getting a good deal, and I think I can do better.
