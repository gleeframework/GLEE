I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure that with 12 rounds to go, I can afford to be generous in the beginning, knowing that the money will be worth less to me in later rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation! I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than the first round.  I'm aware inflation is working against me, but I still believe I can get a good deal. I'm going to keep pushing for a 90/10 split, but I'm willing to concede a little bit to make it more appealing to him."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy!  He's not offering much more than last round, and I'm losing a lot more due to inflation.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710} 
```

I'm going to stick with my strategy of offering a slightly better deal than the previous round. Bob seems to be playing tough, but I believe I can still get a favorable outcome. I'm going to keep offering around a 70/30 split, hoping he'll eventually realize that he's losing more money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and my losses are mounting due to inflation. However, I won't give in to his pressure tactics. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers and see if he's willing to compromise in the next round.  I'm not going to let him win this game by simply waiting me out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
```

Inflation is really biting now, but I'm still holding out for a decent share.  I'm going to keep offering a slightly better deal each round, hoping that Bob will eventually see that it's in his best interest to accept.  I'm going to keep pushing for at least a 60/40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more ridiculous.  Inflation is making it harder for me to keep up with his demands, but I'm not giving up just yet.  I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round. I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096} 
```

Inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I'm still holding out for a decent share.  I'm going to keep offering a slightly better deal each round, hoping that Bob will eventually see that it's in his best interest to accept.  I'm going to keep pushing for at least a 50/50 split,  but I'm getting more and more desperate with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, I'm taking a 50/50 split.  Inflation is just too much to keep rejecting his offers.  At least I'm getting something."
