"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, Alice. Let's see if you'll accept a 50-50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 5000$ is now worth 4,687.5$ (95% of 5000$).

I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal, but I'll accept the offer. It's a 50-50 split, and it's a fair compromise.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
