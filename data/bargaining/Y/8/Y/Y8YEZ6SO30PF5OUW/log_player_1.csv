"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

This is a fair initial proposal, as it splits the money evenly. I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or try to get a better deal for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  It's likely Bob will continue to offer increasingly lopsided deals in favor of himself, and my share of the money will continue to decrease in value."
