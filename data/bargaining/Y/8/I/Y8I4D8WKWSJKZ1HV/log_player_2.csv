"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal offers you a fair share of 250000$. I suggest we agree on this before the value decreases in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair initially, the game mechanics favor Bob.  The money will be worth less for Alice with each round, while Bob's losses are smaller. Bob can likely secure a better deal later in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""This offer reflects the changing value of the money. I'm willing to compromise, but we need to move quickly before the value drops further.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decrease in value, I propose a split of 600000$ for me and 400000$ for you. Let's aim for a balance while maximizing our gains. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob could potentially get a slightly larger share later in the game, the risks are too high.  Alice's offer is more favorable than the previous round's and the value of the money is continuing to decrease rapidly. It's best to secure a good portion of the money now before the value drops further."
