"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the 5% reduction in value, the offer from Bob is effectively:

Alice gain: 3800
Bob gain: 5700

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the first two rounds), I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer, taking into account the cumulative inflation:

Original $10,000 → 95% (5% reduction) → 90.25% (5% reduction) → 86.43% (5% reduction)

So, the offer from Bob is actually:

Alice gain: $8643 × 0.48 = 4147.44
Bob gain: $8643 × 0.52 = 4499.56

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the cumulative inflation, the money is worth 19.26% less than in the first round. Let's calculate the actual value of my proposed gain:

Original $10,000 → 95% (5% reduction) → 90.25% (5% reduction) → 86.43% (5% reduction) → 80.71% (5% reduction)

I'll propose a gain of $8071, which is 80.71% of the original amount. To make it a bit more attractive, I'll offer Bob a smaller share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8071,
  ""bob_gain"": 1929
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... Bob's offer is the same as the one I made in Round 1! With the cumulative inflation, the money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so the actual values are:

Original $10,000 → 77.38% (22.62% reduction)

Alice gain: $7778.00
Bob gain: $2222.00

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's a fair 77.38% split, and I don't want to risk going to another round with Bob.
