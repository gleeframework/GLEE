"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a very generous offer from Bob!

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time for me to make a counteroffer! Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
