"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob receives 20%, which is $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the value of money will decrease in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 60/40 is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for the next round and see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to my initial offer. Let's split it 60/40 this time""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob receives 40%, which is $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
