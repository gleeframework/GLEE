"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair start, Bob.  Let's see if you agree! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice loses value from the money over time, there's no way I'm accepting such a small amount in the first round. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much fairer split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a more equitable split, and we can both walk away with a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is feeling the pressure from inflation, but she's still trying to take the lion's share. I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'm willing to compromise, but not this much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal and avoid losing any more value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split this evenly. We're both losing money with each round, and this is the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's finally happened! Alice is offering a fair deal. It's better to accept this than to risk getting a worse offer later or even running out of rounds."
