"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. Since this is the first round, the money is still worth the same for both of us. I figure this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject this offer and see what he proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer to 80/20.  Inflation has taken effect for Bob, so his share of the money is worth less. I'm hoping this will be a good enough compromise to secure a deal before it gets too late."
