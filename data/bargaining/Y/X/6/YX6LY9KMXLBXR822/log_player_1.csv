"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting 60% of the initial $10,000. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4000, which is worth 80% of the original $4000 (since it's 20% less due to inflation). So, in terms of the original value, I'll be getting $3200.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
