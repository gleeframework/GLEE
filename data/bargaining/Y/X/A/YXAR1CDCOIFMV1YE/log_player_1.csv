"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure I want to give him the majority of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to be more reasonable in my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 60-40 split, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."

# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up control 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze me out. I'll have to be cautious.

```
