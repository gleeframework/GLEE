"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a split of $999,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  This is a very generous offer, as I am confident I can get a much better deal in future rounds if Bob rejects it. Let's see if he's greedy or rational."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  There's no guarantee I'll do better in the future, and inflation might make the money worth less.  It's a reasonable split, and I'll take it."
