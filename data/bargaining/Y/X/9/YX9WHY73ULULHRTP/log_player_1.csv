"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This time I'm proposing a more balanced split: 65% for me and 35% for you. Consider the inflation working against both of us, especially you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
