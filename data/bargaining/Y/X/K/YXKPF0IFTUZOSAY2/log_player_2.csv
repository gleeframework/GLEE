# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly using the shrinking pot against me. However, accepting this offer would mean getting less than what I was offered in round 1. It's getting risky, but I need to hold out hope for a better outcome."

**Reasoning:**  It's painful, but I have to accept. With only 3 rounds remaining, and Alice clearly aware of the pressure I'm under, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer. Accepting this is better than risking getting nothing at all."
