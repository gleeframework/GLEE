"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you take 40""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the 100$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to split it down the middle, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. In this round, I'd actually gain 45 (50 * 0.9) and Bob would gain 50.

I'd rather not accept this offer, as I'd be getting less than I would have in the previous round. My response is:

```
