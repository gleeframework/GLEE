# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 40% of the money, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
