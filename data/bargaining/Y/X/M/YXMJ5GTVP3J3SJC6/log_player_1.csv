"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and take $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the value of money decreases by 20% for me with each round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. By offering Bob a significant amount, I'm hoping he'll accept and we can conclude the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. This is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although I'm aware that the value of the money is decreasing by 20% for me with each round, accepting $45 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a lower offer in the first round due to inflation. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, so I'll proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $45 and take $55 for myself. Given the previous offers, this seems like a reasonable compromise between our positions. Since the value of the money continues to decrease for me, I'm hoping Bob will find this offer acceptable, allowing us to conclude the game before the value drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a way to split the money more evenly. This offer is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer of $40 for me and $60 for him. Although the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me due to inflation, accepting $40 in the fourth round is actually worth less than the face value due to the cumulative effect of inflation. Given that we have several rounds left, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal, so I'll proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more to account for inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $42 and take $58 for myself. Given the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation, I need to adjust my offer to ensure I'm getting a fair deal in terms of actual value. I'm hoping Bob will understand this and accept the offer, allowing us to conclude the game before the value drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting closer, but I need to get more than that to compensate for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer of $35 for me and $65 for him. Although the value of the money is decreasing drastically for me due to inflation, accepting $35 in the sixth round would mean I'm getting an even smaller share of the actual value. Since we still have several rounds left, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal, taking into account the significant impact of inflation on my share. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to find a more favorable agreement."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation, I need a larger share""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $38 and take $62 for myself. Given the drastic decrease in value for me due to inflation (67.23% less than the first round), I must adjust my offer to ensure I'm getting a reasonable deal in terms of actual value. I'm hoping Bob will understand the impact of inflation on my share and accept this offer, allowing us to conclude the game before the value drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation hitting hard, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the extreme impact of inflation on my share, with the value being 79.03% less than in the first round, I will accept Bob's offer of $30 for me and $70 for him. Although this division is far from ideal, the rapidly diminishing value of the money for me means that holding out for a better deal in subsequent rounds is unlikely to yield a more favorable outcome in terms of actual value. Accepting this offer seems to be the most pragmatic decision at this point."
