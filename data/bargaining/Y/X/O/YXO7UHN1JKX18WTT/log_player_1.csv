I'm going to be greedy in the first round and try to secure the majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being quite bold with his proposal! While I'm losing 20% of the value of my potential gain, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. It's my turn to propose, and I'll use this information to craft a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my initial offer. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm going to make a slightly more balanced proposal that might make him more inclined to accept.  The value loss from inflation is still significant, but I believe this offer strikes a better balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While inflation has eroded a significant portion of the potential gains, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I could end up with nothing in the end. It's risky, but I'm going to take the sure thing at this point."
