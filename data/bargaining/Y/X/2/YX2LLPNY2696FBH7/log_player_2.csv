"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40.  We can work out a better split later if you're not happy. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a good starting point, and there's no guarantee we can get a better deal. It's always better to take something than risk getting nothing."
