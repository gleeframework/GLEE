I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something now, the inflation will likely make a later offer more favorable for me."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a fair deal considering the inflation that's happening.  Let's get this done!""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll raise my offer to 70-30 in my favor.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's compromise and end this. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it's a slightly better deal for me than the first offer, I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation. I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor. It's a compromise, but we're both losing money with each round. Let's agree and avoid further losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further and offer a 60-40 split in my favor. We need to reach an agreement soon to minimize our losses! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'll receive, it's the best deal I've been offered so far. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
