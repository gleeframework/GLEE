Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While a 50/50 split was ideal, it's becoming clear she won't budge much.  We need to make a counter offer before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gain, but one that's still acceptable if she accepts to avoid risking it all in the final round."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given your 'final offer' was not final, I'll stick with my initial fair proposal. Consider the decreasing value of your share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful to accept such an uneven deal, but with the inflation rate, waiting any longer will only result in a worse outcome for me."
