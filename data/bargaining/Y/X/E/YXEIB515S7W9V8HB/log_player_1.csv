"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to get him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to split it down the middle just yet. I want more!""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and looking for something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment from my previous offer. Still a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the deal. It's not ideal, but I don't want to risk going to round 12!""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer, and we can finally divide the money!"
