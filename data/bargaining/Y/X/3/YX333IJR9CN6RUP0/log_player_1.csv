"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a little something to get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I was hoping for a more even split, and $100,000 is not enough to make it worth my while. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again!""
}

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, where I get $300,000 and Bob gets $700,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me, while still being reasonable."
