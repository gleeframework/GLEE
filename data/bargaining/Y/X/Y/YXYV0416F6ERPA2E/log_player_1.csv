"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, my gain of $300,000 is equivalent to $300,000 / (1 - 0.05) = $315,789.78 in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is quite aggressive, as he's trying to take a larger share of the pie. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite drastic! Since my money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, my gain of $200,000 is equivalent to $232,000 in the first round.

Considering this, Bob's offer is extremely one-sided, and I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000
