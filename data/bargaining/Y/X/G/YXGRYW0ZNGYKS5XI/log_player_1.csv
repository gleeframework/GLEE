"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the difference, or I'll make a new offer""
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping you'll accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  It's a fair deal, and we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not sure I want to split it down the middle, as it seems like I'm giving up too much. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth less and less. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm not getting any younger""
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000, which is a slightly better deal for me than the previous offers, but still a good compromise."
