"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept and we can split the difference, or I'll make a new offer 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next.  While 2000 is something, I'm hoping for more!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  It's a fair deal, and we both get something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm not getting any younger 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with the 36% loss, I'd rather get 4000 than risk getting nothing at all.  Let's call it a day."
