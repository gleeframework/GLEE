"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fairer split, acknowledging your initial offer. Let's avoid the risk of further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, my initial 600,000$ is now worth 480,000$.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept, since I could potentially do better in future rounds. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less after two rounds (80% of 80% = 64% of the original value), my target gain should be higher to compensate for the devaluation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to compromise to avoid further losses, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% less after three rounds, which means my target gain should be even higher to compensate for the devaluation.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a good opportunity to get a better share. I'll accept this offer.
