"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the potential for inflation in later rounds.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me, and I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, hoping to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is getting worse, and I need to think carefully about my next move. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the majority of the money just yet.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm still keeping a significant amount for myself."
