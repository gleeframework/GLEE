Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the risks of inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the potential loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
