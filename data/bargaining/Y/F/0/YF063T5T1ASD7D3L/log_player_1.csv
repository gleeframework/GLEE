"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering the offer...

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'm actually getting 70% of the reduced value, which is $42. And Bob is getting 30% of the reduced value, which is $24.

Considering the reduced value, I think this offer is a bit better than the first one. I'll accept the offer.
