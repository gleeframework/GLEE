"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time.  I'm willing to go first, but I think a closer split is fairer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as concerned about the exact numbers as I was in the first round. Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, which is more appealing to me.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
