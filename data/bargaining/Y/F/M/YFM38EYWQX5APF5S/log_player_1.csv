"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small share to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm happy to split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for Bob, he's now offering me $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for himself.

I'll accept this offer.
