"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll be getting 20% less than my initial offer. With the current offer, I'd be getting $5,000, which is 62.5% of my initial offer of $8,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
