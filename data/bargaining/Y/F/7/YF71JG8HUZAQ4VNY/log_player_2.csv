Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a little more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, hoping inflation will force me to accept a worse deal. While the value of the money decreases significantly for me each round, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is not in my best interest. I need to push for a more equitable split while there's still time."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alright, let's be realistic. This is a decent compromise. Take it before inflation eats away at everything!""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, but I need to hold strong. Accepting this offer means I lose a significant amount of the potential gain due to inflation. While the risk of getting nothing is increasing, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation. There's still a chance she'll break and offer a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we both lose if we wait any longer!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and we're approaching a do-or-die situation. I need to convey the urgency while still aiming for a reasonable split. This offer is slightly better for Alice than my previous one, signaling a degree of compromise. However, the ""final offer"" message emphasizes that I'm unwilling to accept anything less favorable.  It's a gamble, but at this point, a firm stance might be the best approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I'm not budging 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

It's painful, but I have to accept. We're down to the wire, and Alice is holding firm.  The risk of getting nothing at all is now too high. Accepting this offer, while far from ideal, at least guarantees me something rather than nothing.  Alice played the waiting game well, and unfortunately, inflation forced my hand."
