"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no haggling 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll have to consider whether it's a good deal. Given that I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll have to think strategically.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You said no to 50/50, so I'll try to get a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, trying to get a slightly better deal than the previous 50/50 proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit less 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money's value, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think strategically. Since Bob is now offering a 45/55 split, which is even more in his favor than before, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the significant inflation, my proposal for Round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share to speed up the game, but don't expect it to last""
}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share in an attempt to speed up the game and potentially get a better deal in the next round."
