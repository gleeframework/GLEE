"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a substantial amount to begin with while still giving me the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I'm still losing money, I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is still a significant gain for me while giving Bob a more equitable share. I believe this offer is fair and is likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, I recognize that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, as continuing to reject could result in losing even more."
