I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it quickly.  This is a big gamble, but if he rejects it, I'll be the one making the next offer and the money will be worth less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to give him 90% of the money, even if it means we go to another round. I'll make a more fair offer next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. I'm willing to give Bob a significant portion, but I need to ensure I get a fair share as well.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
