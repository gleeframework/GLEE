# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is a compromise, allowing us both to walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the dwindling rounds, but this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show I'm serious about a more equitable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We need to find a compromise soon. This offer is fair and avoids us both walking away with nothing.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're running out of time.  Take this offer and let's be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but with only 5 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is increasing rapidly.  While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice is unlikely to agree to anything better at this point. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonably good outcome."
