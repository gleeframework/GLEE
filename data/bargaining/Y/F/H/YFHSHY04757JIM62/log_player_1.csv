"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, shall we?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my perception of the offer accordingly.

Since Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, and considering the inflation, I'll calculate my gain as 60% of the original amount, which is $600,000. However, due to the 10% inflation, this is actually worth $540,000 to me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
