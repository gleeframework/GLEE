"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. This is the last round before the inflation hits us both hard. We can both benefit from a quick resolution. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the 50/50 split to avoid further losses due to inflation. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risking a lower value in the next round."
