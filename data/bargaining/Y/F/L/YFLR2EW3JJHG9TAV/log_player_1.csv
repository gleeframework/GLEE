"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and I'm inviting Bob to respond with either an acceptance or a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, but I'm still being generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd rather not give up too much in the early rounds. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to give me $400,000 in the previous round, I'll try to get a better deal this time. I'll offer him a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, but I'll give you a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

With the money worth less and less each round, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations. Bob's offer is still a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less now, I'll have to be more assertive in my proposal. I'll try to get a better deal by offering a smaller share to Bob.

```
