Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to account for the inflation difference, but I'd prefer a larger share since I'm not losing any value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
