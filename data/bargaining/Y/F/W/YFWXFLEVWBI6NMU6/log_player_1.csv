"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that in my decision. In this round, I'd be getting $40, but it's equivalent to $44 in the first round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the significant difference in our gains. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly more aggressive to account for the reduced value of money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share for myself, hoping to take advantage of the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. Considering the reduced value of money, Bob's offer seems reasonable. In this round, I'd be getting $45, but it's equivalent to $36.36 in the first round. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is really affecting the value of my potential gains. Considering the reduced value of money, my offer will be even more aggressive. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm taking a risk and offering an even larger share for myself, hoping to take advantage of the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains. Considering the reduced value of money, Bob's offer seems like a decent compromise. In this round, I'd be getting $42, but it's equivalent to $29.60 in the first round. It's not a bad offer, and I'm not sure if I should risk waiting for a better one. I'll accept this offer.
