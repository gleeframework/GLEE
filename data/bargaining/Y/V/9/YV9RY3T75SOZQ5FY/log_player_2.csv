Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share.  Let's be realistic and split this 50/50 before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
