"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25:75, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a 50:50 split, hoping to get at least half of the money.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations. Alice's offer is still a 60:40 split, but now it's worth less in real terms.

I'll accept this offer to get some money, even though it's not as good as I would have liked.
