I'm going to reject this offer, Bob is greedy and wants a better deal!  Let's see if we can get more money."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here. 50/50 seems like the fairest option. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm going to accept this offer. The money is shrinking fast, and a 50/50 split is reasonable."
