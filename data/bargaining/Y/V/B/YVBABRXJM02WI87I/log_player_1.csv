"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small portion of the money. This is a good starting point, and since the money is worth more to him, he might accept it.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 272728 
# Bob gain: 727272 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking a large portion of the money, and while the inflation is impacting the value, his offer is still significantly unfavorable to me. I'm willing to wait and see if I can get a better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share again, hoping he'll realize that the inflation is working against him. If he continues to be greedy, we might both end up with nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 340000 
# Bob gain: 660000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being very greedy. While the inflation is affecting the value of the money, his offer is still way too skewed in his favor.  I'm going to try to hold out for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm sticking with a balanced offer, hoping Bob will realize that he's risking losing everything if he keeps being so greedy. The inflation is definitely biting, but I still believe that a fair division is the best way to ensure we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still not fair. He's constantly taking the lion's share, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'm going to stick with my strategy of offering a balanced split and hoping he sees reason before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt now. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is the fairest way to divide the money. Bob has been very greedy, but maybe this will finally convince him that it's in his best interest to accept a reasonable offer before we both lose everything."
