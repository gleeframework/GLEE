"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money I gain is worth less, but it's still a decent amount.
* **Alice's Offer:**  It's not ideal, but it's better than risking another round and potentially getting a worse deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm not guaranteed to get a better offer in the future, and the inflation will continue to hurt."
