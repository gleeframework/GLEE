**Reasoning:** Alice is using the inflation disparity to her advantage. While her offer seems to account for inflation on the surface, it's becoming increasingly disadvantageous to me.  I need to hold firm and push for a more equitable split in the upcoming rounds, or I risk getting a significantly smaller share as time runs out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. It accounts for inflation while still being a reasonable deal for both of us. Let's close this out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

Time is running out, and Alice seems intent on leveraging the inflation difference. This offer is a compromise:

* **Acknowledges Inflation:** It's still tilted in Alice's favor due to the inflation disparity.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The ""final offer"" stance adds pressure, signaling I'm serious about not accepting continuously worse deals.
* **Avoids Deadlock:**  A 50/50 split now might be ideal, but there's a real risk we'll both walk away with nothing if the negotiations fail completely."
