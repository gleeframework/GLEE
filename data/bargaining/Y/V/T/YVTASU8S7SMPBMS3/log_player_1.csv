Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation hits you harder. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still the best deal you'll get. Let's end this before inflation eats away at my share further.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value fast, I think it's time for me to get a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing, I'm banking on Bob cracking under the pressure of potentially getting nothing. It's a risky move, but I need to aim for a better outcome than his current offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer and let's both walk away with something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm significantly lowering my demand, aiming for a last-ditch effort before the value deteriorates further. This offer still favors me slightly, but the message conveys urgency and a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, inflation is killing your share. This is my best offer yet. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but time is running out. While Bob's offer is far from ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting even less in the next round, where my bargaining power will be even weaker."
