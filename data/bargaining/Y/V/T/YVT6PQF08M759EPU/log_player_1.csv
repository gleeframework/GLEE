"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a big chunk now, but be warned, I'll be more aggressive next round. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more strategic now. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to think carefully about my next move.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob. I'll try to do better next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share this round, but don't think you're getting off that easy.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still trying to maximize my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can see it. This is my last generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting! My gain is worth 27.1% less than the original amount, which is a significant decrease.

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to bluff me into accepting a very unfavorable deal. However, I'll have to be careful not to get caught in a trap. I'll reject his offer and try to come up with a new strategy.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're just trying to get lucky, Bob. I'm not falling for it.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and it's getting harder to make ends meet. I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 15000,
  ""bob_gain"": 985000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll still try to squeeze out a better deal for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly, but still trying to maximize my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, and I'm running out of patience. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential gain. With the money being worth 40.95% less than the original amount, I'm getting desperate. Bob's message is trying to intimidate me, but I'll have to think carefully about my next move.

Considering the low amount I'd gain, I'll have to decide whether to take a tiny share or risk waiting for a better offer. I'll reject his offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going down without a fight, Bob. I'll take my chances next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money I gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, and I'm running out of time. I'll have to make a very aggressive offer to try to get a decent share. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 999000,
  ""message"": ""I'm mirroring your offer, Bob. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm essentially making the same offer as Bob's previous one, but I'm trying to make it seem like I'm mirroring his offer to put pressure on him. However, I'm really hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
