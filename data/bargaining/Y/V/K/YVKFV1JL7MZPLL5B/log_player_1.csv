"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively low amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll think carefully about the offer. With the current offer, I'd be gaining $50, which is equivalent to $47.50 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split, but I'm still getting a relatively small amount. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll make an offer that takes that into account. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. In this round, my gain of $45 is equivalent to $43.18 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I'm not sure if I should accept. I'm getting a slightly smaller share than in the previous offer, but it's still a relatively close split. I'll think about it for a moment...
