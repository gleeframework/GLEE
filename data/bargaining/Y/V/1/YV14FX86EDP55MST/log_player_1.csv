"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small portion of the money to ensure a quick agreement.  Since inflation is a factor, I want to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, I recognize the risk of further inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount, even with the 20% reduction. It's a better outcome than risking getting nothing."
