Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's start with an even split.  This seems fair to me.  What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with this offer.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer a split that's a bit more in my favor, but still gives Bob a fair share.  I believe this is a good balance considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting less than what I offered, the inflation is hurting me more than Bob. It's better to take this offer than risk getting nothing in the next round."
