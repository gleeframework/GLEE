"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'm getting a slightly better deal than in the first round.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer. I'd like to try to get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to swing it back in my favor. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less, I'm getting a much better deal than in the previous rounds.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer."
