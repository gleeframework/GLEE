"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  We both get a good amount and can avoid further rounds with the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. The split is closer to 50/50, but I'd like to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  A 60/40 split is still better than continuing and risking even more money.  Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob! I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not budging further.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution at this point.  The inflation is eating away at our potential gains, and it's better to split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and Bob is trying to make a fair split. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'm also not sure if I can do better.
