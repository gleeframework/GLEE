8000.0,2000.0,Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  We both get a good amount and can avoid further rounds with the inflation risk.,Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"You're getting greedy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal.",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,Let's be reasonable.  A 60/40 split is still better than continuing and risking even more money.  Let's end this.,Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution at this point.  The inflation is eating away at our potential gains, and it's better to split it evenly and end this.",Bob,6,
