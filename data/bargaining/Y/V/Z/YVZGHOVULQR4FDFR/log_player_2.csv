 I'm going to reject Alice's offer. Although it seems fair at first glance, I know that with each round, the value of the money I receive will decrease. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."

While Alice is offering a bit more, I still believe I can do better.  The inflation is hurting me, and I need to maximize my gains before it gets too bad."

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. The inflation is taking a heavy toll on my share, and I'm determined to negotiate a better deal.  I'm going to try to make a more favorable proposal in the next round."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied. While Alice's offer is more generous, the value of my share is rapidly decreasing. I have to keep pushing for a better deal. I believe I can still get a better offer in the next round."

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Alice's offer is a little better than the previous one, I can't accept it. The inflation is drastically reducing the value of my share, and I still have hope that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm going to try one last time to secure a larger portion."

This is a tough call, but I have to accept Alice's offer. The inflation has made my share worth so little, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers. I'm going to take what I can get at this point."
