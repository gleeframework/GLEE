Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decrease in value, let's meet closer to the middle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take the deal!  It's a better split than last round, and we don't want to risk losing even more to inflation."
