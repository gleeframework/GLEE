I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less with each passing round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal, I'm still getting a significant share of the money. It's not worth risking another round of negotiation, as the inflation could potentially erode my share even further."
