"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still willing to be generous 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new values.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not getting a good deal. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 45-55?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than in my previous offer, and framing it as a ""meeting in the middle"" to see if Bob will accept."
