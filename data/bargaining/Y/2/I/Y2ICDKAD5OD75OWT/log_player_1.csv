"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money, which is a generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still have to be strategic.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I think a 60/40 split is too skewed towards Bob, and I'd like to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like a slightly larger share to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55/45 split, trying to find a sweet spot that's more favorable to me, while still being reasonable."
