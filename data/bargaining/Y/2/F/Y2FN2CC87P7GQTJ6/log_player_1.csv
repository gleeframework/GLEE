Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $90 and Bob gets $10. I figure this is a good starting point, as I'm taking a large portion but still leaving something for Bob. It's unlikely he'll accept this round, but I'm setting the stage for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I'm not thrilled about the inflation, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a compromise here. Since my money is now worth 20% less, I've lowered my initial demand. I'm hoping this will be a fair deal for both of us, and Bob will be more likely to accept it."
