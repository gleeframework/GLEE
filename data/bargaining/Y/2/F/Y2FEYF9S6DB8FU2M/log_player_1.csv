"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial amount, which is a relatively small share, to see if he'll accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the current value.

I'll reject Bob's offer since it's still not in my favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was thinking more like 60/40 in my favor. You can do better than that!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less again, the total is now 8000$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. You can try to counter this offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 45/55 split is a more balanced compromise. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really dwindling fast due to inflation!

I'll consider Bob's new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money. However, I'm not convinced that a 45/55 split is in my favor.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45/55 is fair. I'd like to aim for a 60/40 split. You can do better than that!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll make a new offer that takes that into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be generous, but I need to prioritize my own gain. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are getting closer to the end. Let's work together to find a deal before things get worse. A 35/65 split is a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really dwindling fast, and the value of the gain is decreasing rapidly.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm still not convinced that a 35/65 split is in my favor. I'd like to try to squeeze out a bit more.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 35/65 is enough. I'd like to aim for a 70/30 split. You can do better than that!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and the value of the gain is decreasing rapidly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a final push for a better deal. This is my last offer - take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out. We need to reach an agreement. I'm willing to take 2000 to get something out of this. It's your decision. Do you want us both to get nothing? 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a last-ditch effort to salvage something from the situation.

Considering the extremely low value of the money now, I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, you got a deal. But don't expect me to be happy about it!""
}
```"
