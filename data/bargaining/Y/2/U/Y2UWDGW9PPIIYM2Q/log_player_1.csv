Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your starting point makes sense, but the value of the money decreases rapidly. Let's split the difference from your offer and end this quickly. This way we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
