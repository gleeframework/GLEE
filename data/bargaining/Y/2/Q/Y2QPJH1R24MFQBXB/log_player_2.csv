"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work out something more equitable later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is promising something ""more equitable"" later, there's no guarantee. It's better to push for a fairer split from the start."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  Time is money, and it's ticking away for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I'm not going to lose a significant amount of money just to save time. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still trying to lowball Bob! While her offer is slightly better, it's nowhere near a fair split. Bob needs to hold firm and push for a more equitable division. Accepting this offer would set a bad precedent for future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  55/45 is generous considering the inflation working against me. Let's close this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting tired of this back and forth. This is my final offer, if you want to keep playing, that's your choice, but the money is going down for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, but Alice is bluffing.  She loses *everything* if the deal doesn't go through.  Bob needs to hold his nerve. While the inflation is hurting, accepting a 30/70 split sets a terrible precedent and likely means losing even more in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this now.  Take it or leave it.  We both lose if this goes on.""}
