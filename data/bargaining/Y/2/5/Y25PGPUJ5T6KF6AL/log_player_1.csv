"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm keeping $70 for myself, which is a significant portion, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new values, I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and try to negotiate further. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to make a move. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to account for inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm keeping a larger portion for myself to account for the decreasing value of money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is plummeting!

Considering the new values, I'll have to reassess Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me now, I'm even more cautious about accepting a smaller share.

However, Bob's offer is a slight improvement from his previous one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4.
