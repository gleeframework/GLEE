"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 30 bucks.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm keeping it relatively fair for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I need to consider that the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Since the original amount was $100, and I proposed a 70-30 split, I would have gotten $70 in the first round. With 20% inflation, that's equivalent to $56 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $50, which is more than the equivalent of $56 in the first round. I'd rather take the sure thing!
