"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a small share of the money.  I'm hoping he'll accept it, as it's better than nothing and there's a chance he might get a larger share in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, this offer is still better than nothing, and the value of the money is decreasing with each round. It's likely that Bob will continue to offer me a smaller and smaller amount in future rounds, so I'll accept this offer to secure something."
