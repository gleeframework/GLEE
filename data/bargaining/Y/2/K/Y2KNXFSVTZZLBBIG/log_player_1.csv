"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'm offering you $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This gives me the majority of the money, but leaves Bob with something. Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my offer in the first round. The inflation has hurt Bob more than it has hurt me, and I'm not going to accept such a bad deal. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal. Let's see if Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is getting increasingly favorable to him due to inflation.  My gains are down significantly, and this offer is still better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds.  I'll accept."
