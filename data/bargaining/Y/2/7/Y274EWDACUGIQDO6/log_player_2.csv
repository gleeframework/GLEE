"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  This gives us both a good chunk of money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find something more equitable. This offer recognizes your desire for a larger share while accounting for the time value of money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share.  This offer still gives you a considerable sum while reflecting the fact that the value decreases more rapidly for you with each round. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is better than I could reasonably expect in round 4 after another round of inflation."
