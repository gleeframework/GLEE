"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. 800k for me, 200k for you.  Let's get this done before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her offer, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts me. However, accepting a deal where I get less than a third of the pot is a bad strategy. I need to hold out for a better offer."
