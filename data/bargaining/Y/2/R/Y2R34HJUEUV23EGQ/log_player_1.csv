"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly. My message is a bit cheeky, implying that I'm giving him a ""fair deal"" despite the lopsided split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a pretty reasonable offer, especially considering the inflation factor. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, he's essentially offering me a slightly larger share.

I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
