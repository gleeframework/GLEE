"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, keeping 90% for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'll have to be more strategic in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to take the 50/50 split now.  The inflation will only hurt me more in future rounds."
