"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'm more affected by the inflation in this game.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about this slightly more balanced split? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is slightly better for Bob and worse for me than my initial offer. Considering the inflation, it's getting risky to reject.
