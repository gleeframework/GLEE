"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob takes this offer! I want to keep most of the money in the first round, as the inflation will hurt Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him! I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher share this round.  I'm hoping that he'll realize that the inflation is going to continue to hurt him more than me, and he'll be willing to accept a more even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 36 
# Bob gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is really starting to hurt Bob. Accepting this offer means I'll still get a decent share of the money, and Bob is getting a deal he's likely to accept."
