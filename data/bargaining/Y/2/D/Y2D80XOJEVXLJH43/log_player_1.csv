"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 55/45. Since the money loses value each round, I'm willing to take a bit more to speed up the process. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
