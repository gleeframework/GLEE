"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve the majority of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 55% is fair 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, my gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

However, Bob's offer of $450,000 is a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower values.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
