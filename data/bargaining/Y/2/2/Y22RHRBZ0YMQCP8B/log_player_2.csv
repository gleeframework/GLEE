Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but 51/49 is still too much in your favor. Let's split it 81/19. This gives you a reasonable share while still acknowledging the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 19 
# Alice gain: 81
