"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get the better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 95% now. Better to get most of the money before inflation eats into it. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get the majority of the money before it loses value. My gain of $50,000 is still worth $900,000 in the first round's value, but I need to consider the decreasing value of money.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's split it 60/40""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and get a better deal than the 50/50 split I would get if I just accepted the original 90/10 offer."
