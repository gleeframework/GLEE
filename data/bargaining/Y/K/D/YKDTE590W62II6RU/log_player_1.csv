"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a good starting point, as it gives me a good share while still leaving something for Bob. Since I'm the one proposing, I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than the previous round. I am only receiving 40% of the money, and even though I gain less with each round, it is not worth it to accept this offer. I'll see what Bob proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll offer a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since I'm the one proposing, I'm hoping to get a better deal than Bob's offer.  This still gives Bob a reasonable share, and it's a better deal for me than accepting his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, this offer is better for me than what I'd receive if I reject and propose again. I'll accept this offer."
