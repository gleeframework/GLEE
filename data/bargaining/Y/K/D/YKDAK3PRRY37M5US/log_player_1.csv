"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on inflation, Alice, but I think a more balanced split is fairer.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
