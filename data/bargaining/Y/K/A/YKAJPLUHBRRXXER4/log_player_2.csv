Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'll take $55 and you get $45.  The clock is ticking, and that's still a pretty good deal for you! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
