"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes from here?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm aiming for more in future rounds! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gain as $27 (30 * 0.9).

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm aiming for a higher share, and I think I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, trying to find a middle ground, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is hitting hard!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll calculate the effective gain as $14.20 (20 * 0.71, since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%, and 100% / 72.9% = 0.71).

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's even more skewed in Bob's favor than before, and I think I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can we find a compromise?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35/65 split, trying to find a more balanced deal, while still pushing for a higher share for myself."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to the edge, don't push me too far! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Calculating the effective gain, I'll consider the 10 as 7.1 (10 * 0.71, since 100% - 40.95% = 59.05%, and 100% / 59.05% = 0.705, and 10 * 0.705 = 7.05, rounding to 7.1).

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's extremely skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 7:

```
{

# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eroding my potential gain!

Calculating the effective gain, I'll consider the 5 as 2.35 (5 * 0.47, since 100% - 52.17% = 47.83%, and 100% / 47.83% = 0.4783, and 5 * 0.4783 = 2.3915, rounding to 2.35).

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's an extremely low share, and I'm not willing to accept such a small amount, especially considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I'm running out of time."

# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really devastating my potential gain!

Calculating the effective gain, I'll consider the 1 as 0.39 (1 * 0.3913, since 100% - 61.26% = 38.74%, and 100% / 38.74% = 0.3874, and 1 * 0.3874 = 0.3874, rounding to 0.39).

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's an extremely low share, and I'm not willing to accept such a small amount, especially considering the inflation. I'm not going to give up now, but I'm running out of time and options."

# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has ravaged my potential gain to the point where it's almost worthless!

Calculating the effective gain, I'll consider the 0 as 0 (since 0 is 0% of the original value).

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's not an offer at all - Bob is taking everything. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this unfair deal."
