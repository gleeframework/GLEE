Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit one-sided, Alice.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's still in your favor, considering the inflation and the fact that you can make another offer if you decline. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
