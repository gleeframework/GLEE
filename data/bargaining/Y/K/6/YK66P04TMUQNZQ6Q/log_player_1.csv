Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55:45 split is fair, given the risk of inflation. This way we both get a decent share and avoid losing too much money in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
