"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's move towards that. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my offer is now worth 90% of the original value, so I'd be getting $7,200 and Bob would be getting $1,800.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
