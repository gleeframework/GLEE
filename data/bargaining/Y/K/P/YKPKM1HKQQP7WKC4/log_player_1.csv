I'll start with a highly lopsided offer in my favor, hoping Bob will be willing to take a tiny bit of the money rather than risk getting nothing at all.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is a huge improvement for him, but I'm still not willing to settle for such a small percentage of the money. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a more even split this time.  It's risky, but with each passing round the potential for inflation means I could lose more if I wait.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in a fair deal."
