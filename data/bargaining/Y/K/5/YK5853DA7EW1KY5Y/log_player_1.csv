"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share, especially since inflation is working against me. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to try and compromise a bit more by offering a 75/25 split in my favor.  Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, so I need to secure a reasonable amount this round.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I would consider a fair split. I'm not willing to accept this, especially with the increasing impact of inflation.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 65/35 in my favor.  I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm still hoping to secure a reasonable share.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. While inflation is making my potential gains smaller, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 60/40 in my favor. With inflation hitting both of us, I'm trying to find a compromise while still securing a reasonable share. Let's see if Bob is finally ready to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still disappointed that I'm getting significantly less than my initial offer, I recognize that inflation is working against both of us, and Bob's offer is getting more and more appealing. It's better to accept a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
