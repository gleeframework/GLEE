Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  This is a strong offer considering the inflation working against you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. 60/40 seems like a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is getting better, and the longer the game goes on the less favorable the split will be for me due to inflation working against her.  It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a worse one later.
