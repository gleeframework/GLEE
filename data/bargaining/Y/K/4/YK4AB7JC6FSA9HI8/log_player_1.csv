"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly. It's in my best interest to avoid the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation makes each subsequent round worse for me, and a 7500 gain is still a considerable amount."
