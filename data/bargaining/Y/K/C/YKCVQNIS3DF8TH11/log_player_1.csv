"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. This way, we can both get a decent amount of money and still have a chance to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice. Fair and square. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased by 10%!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to take $5,000, which is worth 90% of the original $5,500 (10% less than the original $6,000).

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
