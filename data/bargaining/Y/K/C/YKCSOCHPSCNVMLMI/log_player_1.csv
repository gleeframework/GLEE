"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""} \n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to receive $600,000, while Bob receives $400,000. Given the rules of the game, where each round decreases the value of the money for both of us (10% for me and 5% for Bob), starting with a higher offer might encourage Bob to accept sooner rather than later, as the value of his potential gain decreases less sharply than mine. The message ""Let's be fair!"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, suggesting that a 60-40 split is a reasonable division, considering the game's structure and the decreasing value of money over rounds. This approach tries to balance the strategic aspect of maximizing my gain with the psychological aspect of negotiation, aiming to persuade Bob to accept the offer without feeling unduly disadvantaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This round only. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer seems less generous than it initially appears. Considering the strategic implications of accepting this offer versus the potential for a better outcome in subsequent rounds, it seems prudent to reject this proposal. The message from Bob suggests a hint of finality (""This round only""), which could be a tactic to pressure me into accepting an offer that is less favorable to me than I might achieve if I continue to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, I maintain the possibility of proposing a more advantageous division in the next round or potentially forcing Bob to make an even more favorable offer as the game progresses and the value of the money continues to decrease."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this offer, I, Alice, propose to receive $580,000, while Bob receives $420,000. Given the decreasing value of money due to inflation, my offer aims to find a balance between maximizing my gain and presenting a proposal that Bob might find acceptable, considering the adjusted values and the game's progression. The message ""Inflation is biting, let's settle!"" is intended to remind Bob of the mutual loss in value over time and to suggest that accepting this offer would be beneficial for both of us, as further rounds would only decrease the real value of our potential gains.

### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's settle!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice! A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","At this stage of the game, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split might seem appealing at first glance. However, factoring in the actual decrease in value due to inflation, this offer is less favorable than it appears. Given that the money I gain is worth 27.1% less and the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than initially, accepting this offer would mean I'm accepting a significantly reduced value compared to the game's start. The strategic move here is to reject this offer, hoping that in the next round, I can either propose a more advantageous division or that Bob will offer a more favorable split due to the increasing pressure of inflation on both our potential gains.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this offer, I, Alice, propose to receive $560,000, while Bob receives $440,000. Given the substantial decrease in value due to inflation, my strategy is to slightly reduce my proposed gain from the previous round, acknowledging the pressure of inflation on both of us. However, I still aim to maximize my gain relative to Bob's, considering the game's progression and the adjusted values. The message ""Let's minimize losses!"" is designed to emphasize the mutual benefit of accepting this offer now, as further rounds will only exacerbate the loss in value for both parties, making this a pragmatic choice for both of us.
