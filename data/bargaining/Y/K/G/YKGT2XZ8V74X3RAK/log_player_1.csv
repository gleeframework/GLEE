"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 90% of the money and leaving 10% for Bob. This is a good starting point, as I believe it's fair given the potential for inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it is significantly less than my initial offer.  I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 70% of the money to myself and 30% to Bob.  While the money is losing value, I believe this offer is still fair considering the risk of getting nothing if we keep going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting less than I initially hoped for, the inflation is starting to hurt, and the risk of getting nothing at all is becoming more significant. I'll accept this offer to secure some money."
