"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, my potential gain is worth even less now.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since my potential gain is worth even less now, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! However, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now.
