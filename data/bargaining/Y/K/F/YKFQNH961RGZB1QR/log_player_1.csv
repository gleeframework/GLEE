I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm lowering my share to $800,000, giving Bob $200,000.  I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with this split. While the inflation is hitting us both, Bob's share is still significantly larger than mine. I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm offering a 70/30 split this time.  I'm willing to keep lowering my share, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise before the inflation eats away too much more of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

I'm still hoping for a better deal. We're running out of time, but I'm not willing to settle for less than 40% of the money."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
