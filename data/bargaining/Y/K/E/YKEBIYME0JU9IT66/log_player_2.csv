"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the 5% inflation, I'm willing to take a risk to potentially get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation.""}\n\nI'm taking into account the 5% inflation for me and the 10% inflation for Alice, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that would be more beneficial for me while still being somewhat acceptable for Alice. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is affecting you, Bob, but I need to think about my own interests too. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice said this is her final offer, I think it's better to accept this deal rather than risking another round. The difference between what I offered in the previous round and what Alice is offering now is relatively small, and I don't want to lose even more value due to inflation. It's time to settle!"
