Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept this as a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer accounts for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite accounting for inflation, the split is now in his favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal considering the impact of inflation on both of us. It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm adjusting my offer to reflect the impact of inflation on both of us, slightly increasing my share while still offering Bob a significant portion, in the hopes that we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, especially with inflation in mind. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, the impact of inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money for both of us. A 50-50 split seems fair, considering we've both lost considerable value due to inflation. It's better to finalize the deal now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.{""decision"": ""accept""}"
