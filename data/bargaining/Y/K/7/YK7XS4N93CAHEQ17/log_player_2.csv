Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob! Inflation is killing your profits! 
# Bob gain: 3800

This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  Alice is clearly playing hardball and knows the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me.  Taking $3800 is better than risking even less next round."
