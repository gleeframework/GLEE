"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I think a 65-35 split is fair, considering the next round the money will be worth less for both of us. Let's be reasonable.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm making a concession. 58-42 is the most I can offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a better split, accepting this offer is the most strategic move. Given the inflation, my gains will continue to decrease, and Alice might become even more stubborn in the next round. It's better to secure a decent amount now."
