"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid wasting time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better deal. How about this one? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob! Accept this offer and we can finally split the cash!""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive with this offer, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not desperate yet! Let's try to find a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it seems like a fair split, and I don't want to risk waiting for Bob's next proposal, which might be even less favorable due to further inflation."
