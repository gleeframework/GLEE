"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the value of the money decreases faster for you.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the value of the money decreases faster for me, I think Bob's offer is a good one. I'll accept it.
