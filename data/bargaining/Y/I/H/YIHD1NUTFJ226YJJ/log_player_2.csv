"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early to accept such a small portion of the money. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a more even split, Alice is already getting a better deal than in the first round and inflation is working against me. It's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing at all."
