"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's gain by 5% each round, I'll have to be more cautious in my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up the majority of the money, especially with the value of Bob's gain decreasing over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted the majority, now I'm taking it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the majority, but I'll give you a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking its toll on Bob's offer, making it worth less than it was in the previous rounds.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 45/55 split, especially considering the value of Bob's gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the one calling the shots!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is a slight edge for me, but still a decent compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a bigger bite out of Bob's offer, making it even less appealing.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up the extra $70,000 that I was initially asking for, especially considering the value of Bob's gain is decreasing rapidly. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but not too much!""
}
```

I'm offering a 52/48 split, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but still a decent compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, let's try to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a significant bite out of Bob's offer, making it less appealing.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the one with the upper hand!""
}
```

I'm offering a 49/51 split, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, and a slight concession to Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, but I'm willing to meet you at the 50% mark 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a significant toll on Bob's offer, making it less appealing.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob at the 50/50 split, especially considering the value of his gain is decreasing rapidly. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
