"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60% for myself.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent offer, but I'm not going to give away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I need to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
