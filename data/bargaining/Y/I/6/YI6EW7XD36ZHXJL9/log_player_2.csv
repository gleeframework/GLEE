That's a terrible deal for Bob!  We can definitely negotiate for more."

Round 2

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This is a better deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not the ""middle"".  Let's see if we can push for more in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This is my final offer.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. We both have a lot to lose if we don't reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best we are likely to get. Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob, and a 50/50 split is fair."
