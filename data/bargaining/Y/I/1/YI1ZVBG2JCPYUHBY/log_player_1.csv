"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept. This way, we both get something and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  If I reject, I'll have to make an offer in the next round, and the money will be worth even less."
