"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a division that slightly favors me, considering that with each passing round, the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. This initial offer aims to find a middle ground, acknowledging the impact of inflation on our potential gains. By suggesting Bob takes 40% and I take 60%, I'm testing his willingness to negotiate while also trying to maximize my gain before the value of the money decreases further in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should start by splitting the money evenly, then adjust as the rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he suggests an even split as a starting point, his actual proposal gives him 60% of the money, which doesn't align with his message. Considering the inflation impact, where my potential gain decreases by 5% and his by 10% each round, I believe there's room for a more favorable division for me, especially since we're only in the second round. I'll aim to leverage the inflation difference in my next proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increased inflation impact on your end, I'm willing to adjust my proposal slightly, but I still believe I should take a larger share given the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've slightly adjusted my initial offer to give Bob a bit more, acknowledging the increased impact of inflation on his potential gain. However, I still aim to maximize my share, considering that the value of the money decreases less for me than for Bob with each passing round. This offer tests Bob's willingness to compromise while I still hold a stronger negotiating position due to the inflation dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be fair and split the money evenly. We both lose more with each passing round, so it's in our best interest to agree now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of an even split in round 4. Given the cumulative effect of inflation, where the value of the money has decreased by 14.26% for me and 27.1% for Bob since the first round, I believe an even split at this point is a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate could lead to further decreases in value, potentially resulting in lower gains for both of us. By accepting this offer, I secure a predictable outcome and avoid the risk of losing more value in subsequent rounds."
