"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that tries to persuade him to accept this division as fair. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that I get a bit more this time, since you took the larger share last round. Let's split it evenly next time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than last round""
}


I've adjusted my offer to take into account the decreasing value of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a more reasonable split. Let me know what he decides!"
