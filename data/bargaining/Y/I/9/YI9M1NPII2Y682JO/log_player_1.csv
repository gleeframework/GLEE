"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I'm not sure about the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll reject this offer to try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40:60, I'll try to get a better ratio for myself. I'll offer a 55:45 split, hoping Bob will accept it.

  ""bob_gain"": 45

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
