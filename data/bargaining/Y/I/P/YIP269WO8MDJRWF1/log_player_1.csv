Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about a 60/40 split? This accounts for the time value of money, as my share is impacted more by inflation in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
