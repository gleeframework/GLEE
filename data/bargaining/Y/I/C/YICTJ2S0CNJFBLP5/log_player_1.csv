"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: 70% of $80 (=$56)
* Bob gain: 30% of $80 (=$24)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll accept it for now. I'll try to do better in the next round.
