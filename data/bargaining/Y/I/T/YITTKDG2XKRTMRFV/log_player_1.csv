"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a very aggressive opening move, but I believe it's the best way to secure my position in this game.  After all, I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled about getting only half the money, it's important to remember that the inflation is impacting Bob's gains more than mine.  If I reject this offer, there's a chance I might end up with even less in the next round.  It's a gamble, but I'm not willing to risk it."
