I'm extremely unhappy with Bob's offer. The money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, and I think I deserve a much larger share. The 1,000 I'd get from this offer is a paltry sum, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm surprised by Bob's offer, but I think I should take it. With the money worth so much less due to inflation, I'd rather get the full 10,000 and take the risk that Bob will get nothing. It's a gamble, but I think it's the best option at this point."
