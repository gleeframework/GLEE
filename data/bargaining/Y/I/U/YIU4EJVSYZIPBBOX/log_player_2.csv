Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Alice, you might be feeling generous, but I'm feeling greedy! This time, I'm taking the lion's share. Let's see if you'll accept this deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. We both get half, and we call it a day. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Half a million is a pretty good deal, and I don't want to risk losing even more with another round of inflation."
