"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This split is fair considering the potential for inflation to eat away at our gains in the later rounds. It gives us both a significant chunk of the money without jeopardizing our future potential. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly less than what I initially proposed, and while he claims it is fair considering inflation, I believe it is still too early to concede such a large portion.  I believe we can find a more balanced split that benefits us both.  Let's see if we can work towards a solution in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This offer is closer to your previous proposal, but still ensures a larger share for me considering the inflation impact.  I believe this is a good compromise.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. This offer balances our needs and accounts for the inflation.  We can secure a reasonable amount now and avoid risking further losses in the coming rounds. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still believe we can find a split that is more favorable for me, given the inflation rate and the risk of losing everything, this offer seems like a reasonable compromise.  It ensures we both receive a significant portion of the money while minimizing the impact of inflation."
