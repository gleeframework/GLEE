This is my offer for Round 1. I want to be greedy and take almost everything, leaving just $1 for Bob.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to have more, taking half is better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round, especially with the inflation factor."
