"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money equally since it's only the second round and the value of the money hasn't been significantly affected by inflation yet. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
