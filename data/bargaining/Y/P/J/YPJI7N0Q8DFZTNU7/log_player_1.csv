Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large share.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's getting late in the game, and with the decreasing value of money, accepting 70 is a decent outcome. I'm taking the offer!"
