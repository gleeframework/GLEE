"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining 10% of the original amount, which is still a substantial amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. I'm trying to be generous to start the game, but I'm also trying to get a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal division of the funds, as I believe fairness should be our guiding principle. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less now, so I'd get 810,000 (90% of 900,000) if I were to accept the offer from Round 1.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a fair proposal, and I'd be happy to accept an equal division of the funds. I'd get 500,000, which is still a significant amount.
