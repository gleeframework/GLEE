"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will affect both of us in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm proposing an 800,000 to 200,000 split.  I'm willing to give Bob more this time, but I still need to secure a significant portion of the money.  We're running out of time, and the inflation is starting to hurt."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 700,000 to 300,000 split. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's the best I can do given the inflation. I believe we need to start coming to an agreement soon before the dwindling value of the money hurts us both too much."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 600,000 to 400,000 split.  We're getting very close to the deadline, and the inflation is really starting to take its toll.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and we need to reach an agreement soon."
