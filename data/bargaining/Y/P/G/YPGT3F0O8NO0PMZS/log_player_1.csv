"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is my first offer. I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively fair deal, knowing that with each passing round the value of the money will decrease due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Although this offer is better than the previous one,  I'm still not satisfied with the 2000/8000 split. I know that the money is decreasing in value with each round, but I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 6000/4000 split in my favor.  While the inflation is a factor, I'm willing to compromise slightly to try and reach an agreement.  This offer still gives me a significant portion of the money and I believe it is a more fair compromise than the previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is pretty fair, and the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  At this point, I'd rather secure a 50/50 split than risk further losses with more rounds of negotiation."
