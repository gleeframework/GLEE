Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, Alice. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd like to aim for a higher amount to compensate for the decreased value. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
