800000.0,200000.0,"Let's be reasonable.  This gives you a significant sum upfront, and avoids the risk of diminishing returns for both of us as the game goes on.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,I'm willing to take on the risk of further rounds to get a bigger share. This offer is more balanced considering the inflation penalty you'll face if we continue.,Bob,2,

680000.0,320000.0,"Bob, I understand you're hoping for a larger share, but the clock is working against me. This offer is my final compromise - it keeps things relatively balanced while acknowledging the time pressure.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Given the significant impact of inflation on your gains, I believe this offer is more than fair. Each round further erodes the value of the money for you, so I suggest we conclude now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer.  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me, and I'm willing to accept a smaller share to avoid getting almost nothing.  It's in your best interest to take this deal now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"Considering the extreme devaluation of the money for you, I'm making an offer that reflects the current reality. I suggest you accept this, as further rounds will render the money nearly worthless for you.",Bob,6,
