This is a tough one, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation hurts:** I'm losing money rapidly with each round.  Waiting longer means a worse deal for me even if Alice comes down slightly.
* **Alice is tough:** Her offers suggest she's willing to play this out for a while.  She might be bluffing, but I can't be sure.
* **Something is better than nothing:**  While 410,000 is much less than I wanted initially, it's still a significant sum.  If I reject, I risk getting a much worse deal or even nothing at all if we can't agree."
