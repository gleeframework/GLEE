"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and we both benefit from ending this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, Alice. Let's end this quickly and avoid losing money to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal than last round for both of us. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains even more. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action considering inflation. It's better than risking further losses in the next round."
