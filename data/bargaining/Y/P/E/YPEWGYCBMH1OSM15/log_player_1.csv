"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain and Bob would gain are:

My gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's better than going to the next round. I accept the offer.
