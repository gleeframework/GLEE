Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I'm also concerned about the inflation affecting my share. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, considering the inflation and that I'm not sure I can get a better deal, I'll accept this offer."
