"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems fair and generous to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, my potential gain is now worth less. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, my potential gain is now worth even less. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
