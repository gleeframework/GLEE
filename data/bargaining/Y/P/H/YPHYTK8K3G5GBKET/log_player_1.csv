"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I get $55 and Bob gets $45. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a reasonable starting point. The message to Bob is a brief explanation of my reasoning, emphasizing fairness in light of the inflation factor. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be realistic about the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth less to both of us due to inflation, I don't think it's fair for Bob to take a larger share than what I initially proposed. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the time value, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\nGiven that we both lose value over time, but Bob loses more, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to still favor me but move closer to an even split, hoping to appeal to Bob's understanding of the diminishing returns and the desire to finalize the division sooner rather than later."
