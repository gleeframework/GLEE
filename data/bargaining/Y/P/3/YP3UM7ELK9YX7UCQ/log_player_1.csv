"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze the offer and decide whether to accept or reject it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the adjusted amounts. In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, and 20% less for Bob.

For me, the adjusted amounts would be:
- My gain: 4000 / 0.95 (5% less) = 4210.53
- Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.8 (20% less) = 7500

Considering the adjusted amounts, I'll decide to reject this offer. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the initial amount, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the adjusted amount, and Bob will get 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted amounts for this round.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob compared to the initial amount, I'll adjust the amounts as follows:

For me:
- Initial $10,000 * 0.8587 (1 - 0.1426) = $8587 (the amount I would get if the offer were made in the first round)
- Adjusted amount for me: 4500 / 0.8587 = 5223.45

For Bob:
- Initial $10,000 * 0.5192 (1 - 0.4808) = $5192 (the amount Bob would get if the offer were made in the first round)
- Adjusted amount for Bob: 5500 / 0.5192 = 10587.57

Considering the adjusted amounts, I'll decide to reject this offer. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 19.56% less for me and 61.68% less for Bob compared to the initial amount, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, I'll get 50% of the adjusted amount, and Bob will get 50%."
