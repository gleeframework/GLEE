Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be higher. This is a reasonable compromise

# Alice gain: 580000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I still think my share should be slightly higher considering the inflation difference 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the game dynamics are working against Bob significantly.  While Alice is experiencing inflation, it's impacting Bob at a far greater rate. Accepting a slightly less favorable deal now is better than risking getting a much worse deal (or nothing) in later rounds."
