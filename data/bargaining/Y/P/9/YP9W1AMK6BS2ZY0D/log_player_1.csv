"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving up too much, let's see if you'll negotiate 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants me to give up too much. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping some for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that the inflation is starting to take its toll on Bob's offer. I'll reject this offer and try to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of the inflation and make a stronger offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going back to my original proposal, but I'm willing to negotiate further. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm essentially trying to revert to the original 50/50 split, but I'm leaving the door open for further negotiations."
