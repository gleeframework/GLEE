"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm incentivized to try to reach an agreement quickly. However, I also don't want to be too greedy, or Bob might reject the offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. A 60-40 split seems like a reasonable starting point, given the asymmetric effects of inflation on our valuations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer to split the money evenly. While the idea of splitting it evenly might seem fair at first glance, I need to consider the effects of inflation. Since the money loses no value for me but does for Bob, I have a strategic advantage in waiting. By rejecting this offer and moving to the next round, I might be able to negotiate a better deal. Additionally, the fact that Bob's gain is worth 5% less in this round compared to the first round means that an even split is not as advantageous for me as it would have been initially. I'll try to leverage this situation to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob. Since Bob is losing 5% of the value with each round, I'll try to find a balance between getting a larger share and making an offer that Bob might accept, considering the money's decreasing value for him.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than it looks""}

I'm increasing my share to 650,000 and decreasing Bob's share to 350,000, with a message pointing out that, due to inflation, this offer is more favorable to Bob than it initially appears. The idea is to make Bob realize that the longer we negotiate, the less value he gets, making this offer more reasonable with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going any lower than this.  Let's end this game! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is trying to end the game and is willing to give me a bit more, the offer is still not in my favor, especially considering that the money's value remains constant for me. With each round, Bob's bargaining power decreases due to the inflation effect on his share, so I'm inclined to continue negotiating for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that continues to take into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob. Given that Bob's share is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round and will continue to decrease, I'll try to find a balance between maximizing my gain and making an offer that Bob might accept, considering his diminishing returns.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at your share; this might be your best chance""}

I'm increasing my share to 700,000 and decreasing Bob's share to 300,000, with a message emphasizing that, due to inflation, this offer might be the most advantageous for Bob at this point. The pressure of inflation on Bob's share should make this offer more appealing, as further negotiation will only decrease the value of his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'm not giving up any more. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob claims this is his final offer and is trying to assert a sense of urgency, the effects of inflation on his share continue to weaken his bargaining position. Given that the money's value for me remains constant and Bob's share is now worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that continues to leverage the impact of inflation on Bob's share. Given the significant decrease in value for Bob, now at 22.62% less than in the first round, I'll aim to maximize my gain while presenting an offer that might still be acceptable to Bob, considering his rapidly diminishing returns.

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Inflation is severely impacting your share; this is likely your last good opportunity""}

I'm increasing my share to 750,000 and decreasing Bob's share to 250,000, with a message highlighting the severe impact of inflation on his potential gain. The hope is that Bob will recognize the continually decreasing value of his share and accept this offer rather than risking further loss of value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a gamble here.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but this is it.  If you reject this, you'll be getting a much worse deal next round. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is trying to frame this as a gamble and suggests that I'll get a worse deal next round, the fact remains that the money's value for me does not change, while Bob's share continues to lose value due to inflation. Given that Bob's share is now worth 30.17% less than in the first round, I believe I can still push for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that continues to take advantage of the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share. With Bob's share now worth 30.17% less than in the first round, I'll aim to maximize my gain while presenting an offer that might still be acceptable to Bob, given his rapidly diminishing returns.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Inflation has severely eroded your bargaining power; this is a reasonable conclusion""}

I'm increasing my share to 800,000 and decreasing Bob's share to 200,000, with a message emphasizing the severe erosion of his bargaining power due to inflation. The aim is to make Bob realize that, given the circumstances, this offer is a reasonable conclusion to the negotiations."

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final stand. I'm willing to give you the bare minimum.  If you reject this, you'll be getting nothing next round. It's your call. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's dramatic language about this being his ""final stand"" and the threat that I'll get nothing next round, the economic reality remains in my favor. The money's value for me has not changed, while Bob's share is now worth 36.98% less than in the first round. Given this significant disparity, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that maximizes my gain, considering the extreme impact of inflation on Bob's share.

{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Given the effects of inflation, this is a generous offer""}

I'm increasing my share to 850,000 and decreasing Bob's share to 150,000, with a message framing this as a generous offer, considering the significant erosion of Bob's bargaining power due to inflation. The goal is to conclude the negotiations on terms highly favorable to me."
