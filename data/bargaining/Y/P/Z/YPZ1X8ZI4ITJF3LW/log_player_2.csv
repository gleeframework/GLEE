"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  I take a bit more to account for the faster inflation hitting my share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it more evenly, but I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation impacting my side.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take a decent deal now, before the inflation eats away at your gains even more! 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I would get if we go to another round, where the inflation will be even worse for me."
