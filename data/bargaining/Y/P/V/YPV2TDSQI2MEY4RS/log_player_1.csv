"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share""}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a slightly better deal, while still being reasonable."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about accepting a 60-40 split, especially since the money is worth so much less than it was initially. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to concede a bit more, but I think this is my final offer""}

I'm trying to find a balance between being reasonable and holding out for a better deal. This offer is a slight compromise, but I'm hoping it's enough to get Bob to accept."
