"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small portion, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm trying to make a good first impression and see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to try to negotiate.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly. I'm not sure if the offer is fair, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm still a bit short. Can you offer me a bit more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $65 and Bob gets $35. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's time to wrap this up 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the drastic decrease in the value of the money, I'm not sure if the 50-50 split is as good as it seems. However, I'm also not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity to split the remaining amount.

I'll accept this offer and call it a day:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's split it 50-50. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing.""
}
```"
