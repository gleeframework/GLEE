  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""

I'm offering Bob 3000$ and keeping 7000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a fair share, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to re-evaluate the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's 50/50 offer because, considering the inflation, I'd rather try to get a better deal. The money I'd gain in this round is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'd rather not settle for 5000$. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need a good deal!""

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, I still think I can do better. The money I'd gain in this round is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and I'd rather try to get a larger share to compensate for the significant loss in value."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make another offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a bit more!""
}
```

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in yet, I'll try to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Considering the significant reduction in the value of money, I think 4000$ is a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round where the money will be worth even less. It's better to settle for this deal and end the game."
