"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob 450,000 dollars and kept 550,000 dollars for myself, with the message ""Let's share fairly"". Now it's Bob's turn. Please let me know if he accepts or makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually equivalent to $320,000 in the first round. Considering this, I will reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I will make a new proposal, taking into account the reduced value of the money. Please let me know how Bob responds.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nAs we are now in Round 3, I must remember that the money is worth 40% less for me compared to the first round due to the 20% decrease in value each round. Considering this, I will adjust my proposal accordingly to ensure a fair share in terms of the original value. Here's my offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust fairly""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds to this proposal.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, take it or leave it. Time is running out! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven that the money is now worth 48.8% less for me compared to the first round, Bob's offer of $450,000 is actually equivalent to approximately $230,400 in the first round. This is a significant reduction in value. However, considering Bob's message that this is his final offer and time is running out, I must weigh the risks of further negotiation against the certainty of this offer. Since further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for me, and there's a risk Bob might offer even less or nothing at all if we continue, I will accept this offer to secure what I can.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I accept his offer, and we can conclude the game."
