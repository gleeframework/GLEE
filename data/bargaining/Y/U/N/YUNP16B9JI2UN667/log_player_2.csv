Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is really hurting your share. I'm willing to take a bit more, but still giving you a reasonable amount. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds.  I'm getting close to the point where the inflation will make any further gains meaningless."
