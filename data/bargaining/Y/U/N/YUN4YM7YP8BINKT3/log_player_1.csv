"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given our respective inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'd rather not accept a 40% gain for myself, even if it's more than in the previous round. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 55/45 split""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer, taking into account the 5% decrease in value for me and the 20% decrease in value for Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need a bigger share too!""
}
```"
