"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal. I'm taking a larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer.  Even though the money is worth less in the next round, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to bridge the gap a bit by offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a majority for myself. The inflation is starting to take its toll, but I still believe I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is significantly hurting both of us. I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and keep pushing for a more favorable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm reducing my share a little more to try and find a middle ground. I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm still prioritizing getting a deal done before it gets too late. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is starting to seriously impact the value of the money. Even though we're getting closer to a deal, I'm still not comfortable accepting an offer where I'm getting less than 60% of the money.  I believe we can still reach a more agreeable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

The inflation is making this game increasingly difficult. I'm reducing my share further, but I need to secure a deal soon to minimize the losses.  Hopefully, Bob will recognize the urgency and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 570000 
# Bob gain: 430000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt, and we are running out of time. While I'm not thrilled with the offer, I'm accepting to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.  It's time to secure something, even if it's not ideal."
