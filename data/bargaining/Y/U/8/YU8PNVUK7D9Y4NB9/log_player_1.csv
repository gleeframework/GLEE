Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting us hard, I need a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the impact of inflation is becoming more significant, accepting this offer would leave me with significantly less than Bob in the long run.  It's worth risking another round to negotiate a fairer split, even with the inflation penalty."
