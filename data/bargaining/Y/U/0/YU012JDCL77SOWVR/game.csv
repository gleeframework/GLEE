6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split the money. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider that the value of the money decreases over time for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fairer share considering the value of the money decreases with each round. Let's avoid further losses and come to an agreement.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's stop wasting time and both losing money. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly. It's the most logical solution considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
