Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think 60 is still a reasonable amount considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
