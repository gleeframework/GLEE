"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer ensures a large share for Alice while still providing Bob with a decent amount. It's a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, it's still highly unfavorable to me. By rejecting, I can control the next round and potentially secure a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor impacts Bob's gains more than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This offer is a compromise, taking into account the inflation factor and the fact that Bob likely wants to get something. Offering a larger share to Bob than in Round 1 could make him more likely to accept, while still securing a significant portion of the money for me."
