"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Accept and we can end the game now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself, which is a 90% share of the initial $10,000. This is a generous offer, considering we have 11 more rounds to go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We both get half, and we're done. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still have the same amount to gain, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not being serious about being fair, Bob. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of me.""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give Bob, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's split the difference from our last offers and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll on Bob's offer, making it worth even less.

I'll consider Bob's new offer. Splitting the difference between our last offers is a reasonable approach, and it's better than waiting for the money to devalue further.

I accept Bob's offer.
