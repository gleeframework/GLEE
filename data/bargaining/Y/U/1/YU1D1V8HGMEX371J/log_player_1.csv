"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm looking for a good deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm willing to give you a good share, but I need more than 2000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split it 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* $8,000 x 0.9 = $7,200 (10% less than the original $8,000)
* $2,000 x 0.95 = $1,900 (5% less than the original $2,000)

Now, let's evaluate Bob's offer:
* If I accept his offer, I would get $4,500, which is $2,700 less than the adjusted $7,200 I would get if I had made the original proposal.
* However, I would get $5,500, which is $3,600 more than the adjusted $1,900 I would get if I had made the original proposal.

Considering the trade-off, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Since the money in the game is now worth 90% of its original value (0.9 x 0.9 = 0.81), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the cumulative inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to make up for the lost value. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
