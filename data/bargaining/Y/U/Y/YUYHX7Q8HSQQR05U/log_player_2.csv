Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but my offer is still fair.  I'm willing to stick with it for now to avoid us getting too deep into this and risking losing more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

""message"": ""Alice, it seems clear we both want a larger share of the pie. But let's be realistic: the longer this drags on, the less we both get. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Take it or leave it - time is literally money.""
