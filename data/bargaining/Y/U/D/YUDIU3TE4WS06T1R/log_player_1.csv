Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give up too much. It's still a good offer, and we can move on to the next round. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
