"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth something. This offer gives us a good head start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is decent, I can likely get a better deal by making my own proposal in the next round. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the fairness of your first offer.  Let's both do a little better this round. How about we split the money 60/40 in my favor?"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is better than my previous offer, but I believe I can still get a larger share. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""We're both losing value with each round.  Let's compromise and split the money 55/45 in my favor.  This gives us both a significant amount and keeps us from losing too much to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a good compromise and gives us both a decent share before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired split, and the inflation is becoming a serious concern. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a significant amount before we both lose much more."
