Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This offer gives us both $50 each, which seems like a fair starting point."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the effective value of the offer.

My gain of $20 is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $80 is worth only 80% of the original $80, which is $64.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more, now it's your turn to compromise.""

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the offer.

My gain of $30 is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $70 is worth only 51.2% of the original $80 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%). So, Bob's gain is worth approximately $41.60.
