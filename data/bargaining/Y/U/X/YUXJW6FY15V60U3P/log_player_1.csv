"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k and take 600k for myself. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this time, but I'm still willing to split fairly.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer of 550,000$ is a bit too generous for me this round. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm. Take 520k and I'll take 480k. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 520,000$ and keeping 480,000$ for myself, trying to find a sweet spot that's slightly more generous than my previous offer."
