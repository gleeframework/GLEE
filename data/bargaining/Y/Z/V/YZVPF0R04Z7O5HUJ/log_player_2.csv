Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, time is running out. I'll meet you closer to halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, moving closer to a 50/50 split. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in a future round carries a significant risk that Alice won't offer more, and Bob will be left with an even less favorable outcome due to inflation.

Taking the 4300 USD now is a better outcome than risking getting a much lower amount later."
