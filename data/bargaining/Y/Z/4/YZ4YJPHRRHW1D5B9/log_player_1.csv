"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, but I'm offering a slightly higher amount to me, which might be a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, let's see if you accept 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my counteroffer due to the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous for you, I want more""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending a message to indicate that I'm looking for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous rejection, I'll make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging""
}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split considering the current value of the money.
