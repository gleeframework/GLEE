I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I understand Bob is trying to get a larger share, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'm going to reject this offer and see what he proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial proposal, but still a significant amount. I believe this is fair considering the inflation and that he rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is lower than what I initially hoped for, accepting it is still better than risking further inflation. I'm confident I can find ways to make up for the loss elsewhere."
