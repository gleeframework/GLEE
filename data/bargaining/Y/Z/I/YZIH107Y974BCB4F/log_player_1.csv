"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100, and keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

* My gain: $70 \* 0.9 = $63 (10% less than the original $70)
* Bob's gain: $30 \* 0.8 = $24 (20% less than the original $30)

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's still better than going into another round. I'll accept the offer.
