"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is still worth $6,000, but the inflation means Bob's gain of $4,000 in the first round is worth $3,600 in this round.

Considering Bob's offer of $5,000 each, it seems like a more balanced proposal than my initial one. I'll accept this offer.
