  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 10 in the next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30$ and keeping 70$ for myself, with the message that if he accepts, we can split the remaining 10$ in the next round, which will be worth less due to inflation."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so the offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 160,
