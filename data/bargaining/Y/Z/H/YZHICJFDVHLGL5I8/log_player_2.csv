"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly. This offer gives me a good share considering the inflation, but you'll still walk away with a nice sum. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. You're not factoring in the inflation that's eating away at my potential gains. This offer is fair and gets us both a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still heavily favoring herself in this deal, even with the inflation.  While she is acknowledging the inflation, she's using it as leverage to secure a larger portion. I need to show her I'm willing to push this further to get a better deal."

""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're approaching the halfway point. My offers have been more than generous considering the inflation I'm facing. I need you to meet me closer to the middle ground on this. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure me by highlighting we're past the halfway point. However, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, even after factoring in the inflation. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair split and won't be pressured into a bad deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering a compromise at 55/45. This factors in the inflation, but also acknowledges that we need to reach an agreement soon.  Don't let this opportunity slip away.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  You're holding out for an ideal deal while I'm being eaten alive by inflation. We both need to benefit here.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to be pragmatic. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and has labeled this as her final offer. While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum before inflation further diminishes Alice's share, potentially leading to a worse deal or no deal at all in the later rounds."
