Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. We both know this inflation is messing things up.  How about we split the difference this round, 55 for me and 45 for you?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with something decent. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
