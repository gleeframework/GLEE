"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not 50/50 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is not 50/50, I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting. With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of the original $5000 I could have gotten in Round 1, so it's a bit less than I initially proposed. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 80% of the original $7500 he could have gotten in Round 1, so it's a relatively better deal for him.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was not 50/50, I'll try to make a new offer that's even more favorable to me. With the inflation, my gain will be worth even less in subsequent rounds, so I'll try to get a better deal now.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go any higher!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but you're still giving me too little 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll consider his new proposal. With the inflation, my gain of $5800 is worth 116% of the original $5000 I could have gotten in Round 1, so it's a better deal for me than the $5500 I proposed in Round 3. However, Bob's gain of $4200 is worth 56% of the original $7500 he could have gotten in Round 1, so it's still a relatively better deal for him.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's a better deal for me than my previous proposal and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.
