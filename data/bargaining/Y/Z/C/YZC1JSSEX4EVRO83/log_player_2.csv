Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value. My last offer was fair, but I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid getting nothing. Let's split it 55/45 and end this. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
