Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to 55/45.  It's a fair deal that accounts for the inflation, and will get us both more money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
