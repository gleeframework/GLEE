"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, my gain of $400,000 is worth 80% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 95% of its original value.

I'm not too excited about this offer. I'd rather negotiate further. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, my gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%), and Bob's gain is worth 90.25% of its original value (95% of 95%).

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```
I'm proposing a 55-45 split."
