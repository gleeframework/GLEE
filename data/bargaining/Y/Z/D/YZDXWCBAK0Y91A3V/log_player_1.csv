I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  Hopefully, he'll accept and we can both get something!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a bit of a power move, Bob, but I'm not willing to be exploited. Let's see if we can find a fairer solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share this time. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being greedy. I'll keep rejecting until he gets the idea that we need to find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping we can find some middle ground. We only have a few rounds left, so I need to be more flexible."
