"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. I'll keep $8,000, which is 80% of the original amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 4000 * 0.95 = 3800
* Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.95 = 5700

I accept this offer.
