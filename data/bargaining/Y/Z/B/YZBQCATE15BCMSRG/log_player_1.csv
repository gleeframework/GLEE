"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob.  This is a fair starting point given the high potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred a larger share,  I'm accepting this offer. Inflation means my share is worth less, and accepting this guarantees me some money."
