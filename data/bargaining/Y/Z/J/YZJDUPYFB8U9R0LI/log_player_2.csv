"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 850000,
""alice_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic Alice. The longer this goes on, the less there is for both of us.  This is more than fair considering the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's get this done. This is a fair split given the time pressure and the inflation affecting you. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering a bit more, the devaluation is significant. Accepting 200,000 now is a terrible deal compared to what we could get by holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  I'm willing to be generous, but this needs to be settled soon. ""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting tired of this, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle and get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While 300,000 is a decent amount, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering she's not losing anything to inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it's getting risky."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a more than fair split considering the circumstances.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""}"
