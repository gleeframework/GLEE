"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share (60% of the money) while ensuring Bob still gets a decent amount (40%). It's a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate in the next round if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original offer, even after accounting for inflation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair given the inflation we've both experienced.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than the 50/50 split I proposed in the previous round, even with inflation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid another round of inflation, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize that this is a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not only worse than my last offer, it's actually worse than his offer in round 2, after accounting for inflation. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

This is a final attempt at a 50/50 split.  We've both been through a lot of inflation, and it's the fairest solution at this point.  If Bob rejects this, we'll likely both be worse off in the next round."
