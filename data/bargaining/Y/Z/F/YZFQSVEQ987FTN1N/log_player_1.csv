"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $60 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $48, and Bob's gain of $40 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $36.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I was hoping for a better deal, considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. My gain of $60 from the previous round is now worth 64% of its original value, which is $38.40, and Bob's gain of $40 is now worth 81% of its original value, which is $32.40.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55% share for myself and 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I'm not giving away too much! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $55 from the previous round is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $26.56. Bob's gain of $45 is now worth 73.1% of its original value, which is $32.85.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer because, considering the inflation, $26.56 is a decent share for me, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value."
