"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, considering we're just starting the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll, and my gain is worth 20% less than before. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

Since Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 40% of its original value. I'll make a new offer, trying to take a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering 55% of the remaining money, leaving 45% for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to your end, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking its toll! My gain is now worth only 51.2% of its original value. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

Since Bob is offering a 45-55 split, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with even lower gains due to inflation."
