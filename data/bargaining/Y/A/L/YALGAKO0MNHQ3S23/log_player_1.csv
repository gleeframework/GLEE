I'm going for a very aggressive first offer, aiming to secure almost all the money.  Since the value of the money decreases with each round, I want to maximize my share as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, this offer is a fair split and the inflation risk means it's better to secure half now than risk getting less later."
