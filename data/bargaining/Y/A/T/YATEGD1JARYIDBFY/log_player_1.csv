"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 6000 and Bob gets 4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 3000-7000 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less to Bob due to inflation, I'm not as opposed to the idea of giving him a bigger share.
