Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's too low for me. Let's be realistic: I take 65%, you take 35%. This considers the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
