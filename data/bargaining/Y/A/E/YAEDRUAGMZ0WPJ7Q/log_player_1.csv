Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split is the most equitable. We both get a good deal this way. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
