"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you get 40""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and straightforward division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want to keep some 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'll take a slight majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk too""}

I'm proposing an 80-20 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want to keep a bit more than last time 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the 75-25 split, but considering the significant inflation and the fact that I was rejected twice before, I think I'll take this offer. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing, and I'll take the 75 dollars."
