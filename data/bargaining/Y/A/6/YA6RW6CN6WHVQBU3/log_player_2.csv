Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. I'm willing to compromise, let's go for a 55/45 split. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that we both lose money with each passing round.

# Alice gain: 5500
