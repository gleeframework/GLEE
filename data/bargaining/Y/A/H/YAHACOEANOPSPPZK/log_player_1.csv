Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer.  I'll take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a risky strategy, as he could easily reject it. However, it sets a strong precedent for future rounds. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, it's his turn to offer a division, and I'll know he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, it's clear that Bob is not willing to accept a highly uneven split.  Accepting his offer means getting half the money, which is a lot better than risking further rounds and potentially getting nothing.  With the inflation factor, the value of my half is diminishing each round."
