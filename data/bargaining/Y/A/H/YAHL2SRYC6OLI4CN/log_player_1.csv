"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a measly $1.  It's unlikely he'll accept this, but it's a good starting point to see how he values money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer and I don't want to risk losing any more money due to inflation.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money."
