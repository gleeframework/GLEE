"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the initial $10,000. This leaves me with $6,000, which is 60% of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a 50/50 split, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 from the previous round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4,800.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since I think I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. However, I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if 50/50 is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $4,800 from the previous round is now worth 64% of its original value, which is $3,072.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share this round, but I think I deserve a bit more for making the offer. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $6,800, which is 68% of the current total, and keeping $3,200 for myself, which is 32% of the current total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round, but I think I deserve more for making the offer. I'll give you 3000, but you have to accept it. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $3,072 from the previous round is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately $1,570.56.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a share of $3,000, especially since I think it's a relatively small amount compared to the original $10,000. However, I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if $3,000 is enough, considering the original amount and the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $1,570.56 from the previous round is now worth 40.96% of its original value, which is approximately $637.22.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
