"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get him to accept early.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to secure a large portion of the money before it loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation is starting to affect my gains significantly. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent share of the money, and it's better than risking further losses in future rounds."
