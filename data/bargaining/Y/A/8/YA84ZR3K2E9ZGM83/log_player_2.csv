Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make my proposal for round 2.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is making things complicated. Let's split it down the middle, 50/50. It's the fairest way to go forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll consider Alice's new offer in round 3, keeping in mind the impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us.\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money I gain is now worth 9.75% less and for Alice it's worth 19% less, her offer of a 50/50 split seems more reasonable, especially considering the decreasing value of the money with each passing round.\n\n###\n\nHere's my decision:\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game here. It seems like a fair point to end, considering the circumstances.\n\n###\n\nThanks for playing the game with me!
