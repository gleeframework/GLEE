"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4,000. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by inflation, so I'll assume it's still $5,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a fair offer. I'll accept it to avoid going to the next round and risking further erosion of my gain due to inflation.
