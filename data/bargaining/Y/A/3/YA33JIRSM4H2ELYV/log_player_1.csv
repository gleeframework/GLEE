"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the original 100$ and Bob 20%. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: 60$
Bob's gain: 40$

This offer is actually a bit more generous than my previous offer, but I'll stick to my initial strategy of trying to get the better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but inflation has reduced the value of Bob's gain by 5% again, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Accept and we can end this!""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share than before, but still leaves room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: 70$
Bob's gain: 30$

This offer is a bit more generous than my previous offer, and considering the reduced value of Bob's gain due to inflation, I think it's a good opportunity to accept. I'll take it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
