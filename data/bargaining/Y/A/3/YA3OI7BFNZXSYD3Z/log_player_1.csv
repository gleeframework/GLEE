"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This seems like a fair first offer, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
