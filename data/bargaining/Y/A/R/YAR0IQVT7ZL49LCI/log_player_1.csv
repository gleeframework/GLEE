"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

The original $1,000,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 0.95 * 550,000 = 522,500
* Bob's gain: 0.95 * 450,000 = 427,500

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the two previous rounds), I'll make a new offer.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000, which is a slight increase from his offer in round 2, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 0.855 * 510,000 = 436,355
* Bob's gain: 0.855 * 490,000 = 418,955

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 19.26% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the four previous rounds), I'll make a new offer.

Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $480,000, which is a slight increase from his offer in round 4, considering the reduced value of the money."
