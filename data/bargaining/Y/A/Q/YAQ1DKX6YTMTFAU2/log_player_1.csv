"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob. This might seem generous, but remember, inflation will reduce the value of the money in future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I think a 3:2 ratio is more reasonable considering the risk of inflation. Let's take a chance on a slightly more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
