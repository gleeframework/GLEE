"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's see if you can do better!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation will affect us both differently. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I understand Bob's point about the inflation affecting us differently. I'll decide to accept this offer for now.
