I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see if Bob is willing to accept it.  I'm hoping he'll think that the money is worth more to him now than it will be later.  We'll see!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8500 
# Bob gain: 1500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'm going to accept this offer.  While it's less than my original proposal, it's still a decent amount of money, and I don't want to risk further inflation eroding the value of the money."
