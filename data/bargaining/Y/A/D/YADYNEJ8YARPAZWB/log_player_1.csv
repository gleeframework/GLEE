"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 60, I'll take the majority this round 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't like the idea of Bob taking the majority this round, especially since the money I gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a bigger share this round, but I still want a decent chunk for myself.""}

I'm proposing that I get 40% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting smaller and smaller, I'll take the majority again 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting worried about the trend here! Bob's offers are getting more aggressive, and I'm getting a smaller and smaller share. I'll try to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share this round, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of completely. I want to make sure I get something decent out of this.""}

I'm proposing that I get 30% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 70%."
