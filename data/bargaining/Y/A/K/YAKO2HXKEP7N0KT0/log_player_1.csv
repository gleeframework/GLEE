# Bob's message: I think I deserve a slightly bigger share, as I get to propose this time.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I deserve a better deal, considering the initial 50/50 split I proposed. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer is too skewed in Bob's favor. Let's see what's next!"
