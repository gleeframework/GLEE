"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's not fair that Alice gets almost twice as much as I do. I think I deserve a more equal share. Let's see what happens in the next round. Maybe I can get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to make a more balanced offer. Since the money loses value for Alice in each round, maybe she'll be more willing to compromise.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This way, we both get a decent share.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and the value is decreasing. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI previously offered Alice a deal where I got $450,000, and now she's offering me less. Given that the money's value doesn't decrease for me, I can afford to wait and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Maybe Alice will be more willing to compromise as the value of her share continues to decrease.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Alice. Since she's under more pressure to make a deal, maybe she'll accept a slightly less favorable offer.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the decreasing value, I think this is a reasonable offer. We should both be willing to compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's the best I can do considering the time pressure and the decreasing value. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI previously offered Alice a deal where I got $520,000, but she rejected it. Considering that the money's value doesn't decrease for me, I could keep waiting for a better deal. However, Alice's offer of $450,000 is closer to my previous offer than her previous counteroffer of $400,000, and she claims it's her final offer. Given that the difference between my last offer and her current offer is $70,000, and considering the pressure on Alice due to the decreasing value of her share, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer to ensure I get a significant share of the money.\n\n###\n\nPlease conclude the game. I've accepted Alice's offer."
