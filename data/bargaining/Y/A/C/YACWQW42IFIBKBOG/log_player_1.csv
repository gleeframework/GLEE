"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll give you a decent share too 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 90% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of the original amount.

I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not go to the next round if I can get a better deal now.
