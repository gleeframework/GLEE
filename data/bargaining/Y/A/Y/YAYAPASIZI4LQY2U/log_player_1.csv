"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a larger share, but I want to keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my effective gain would be 58.5 (60 * 0.95). Bob's gain, on the other hand, is worth 20% less than in the first round, so his effective gain would be 24 (30 * 0.8).

Considering the offers, I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, as I'd be giving up a significant portion of the total. However, I'm willing to consider it since it's a slightly more generous offer than the first one.

I'll decide to:
