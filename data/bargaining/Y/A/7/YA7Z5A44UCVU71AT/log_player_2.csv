"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While it seems like a fair offer on the surface, I need to consider the impact of inflation. It's better to be a bit more aggressive early on while the money is worth more to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, Alice, but inflation hits me harder. Let's be realistic - 60/40 my way.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be sensible. This offer still gives you a good deal considering the inflation. It's better to agree now than lose more later. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is getting worse. I need to hold firm and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but the deal has to be fair. 55/45 is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my offer again, but this is the last time. Agree now, or we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to be realistic.  The longer this goes on, the less the money is worth to me. Accepting 48 now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we can't reach an agreement."
