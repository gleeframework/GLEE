"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20 dollars to get us going""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving Bob a relatively small amount to get us started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous with 20, now it's my turn to make a good offer 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather have a higher share of the money, considering it's still worth the same for me as in the first round. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me as in the first round, I'll try to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""You said I was generous, now it's time for you to make a real concession!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 85-15 split, which is a more favorable split for me. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing me to the limit, but I'm still holding out for a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 88 
# Bob gain: 12 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain significantly, I'll take a closer look at the offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values.

I'll accept this offer because the difference between 88 and 12 is quite significant, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal from Bob. The inflation has made his gain worth much less, so I'll take the higher share.
