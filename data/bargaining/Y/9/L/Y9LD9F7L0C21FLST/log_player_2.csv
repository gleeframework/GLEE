**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, Alice is clearly aware of the pressure Bob is under.  It's still better to push for a slightly better deal for a couple more rounds and see if Alice cracks.  The risk is that she continues to offer progressively worse deals, but Bob's losses are accelerating faster than hers."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Holding out for more is getting too risky. Offering a 50/50 split avoids appearing greedy and might be the key to ending the game before the losses escalate further."
