"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain of $7,000 is actually worth $6,300 (since it's 10% less than the $7,000 I would have gotten in the first round). Still, it's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and getting a worse deal.

I'll accept this offer.
