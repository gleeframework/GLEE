"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll take 58% and you get 42%. It's more than fair considering the inflation!""}\n\n### I made an offer that is slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation that affects both of us. I also tried to make it sound reasonable and appealing to Alice. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 42%.  Let's split it 55/45,  that's a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Alice's offer because, considering the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The fact that the money is worth less to both of us, but more significantly to Alice, gives me leverage to negotiate for a larger share. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your end, I think 60% for me and 40% for you is more than fair. It's the best offer you'll get from me!""}\n\nI've increased my share to 60% and decreased Alice's share to 40%. Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on Alice's end, I believe this offer is still reasonable and may be more appealing to her than continuing to negotiate further. Let's see if she accepts!"
