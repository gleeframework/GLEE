"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

This offer gives me most of the money, but I still leave Bob with a small share, hoping to incentivize him to accept and avoid the risk of inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it seems unfair, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the future. The value of the money is decreasing, and I'm willing to take the risk of waiting to see if I can get a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the first round.  I believe that this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation factor.  It's still a good deal for me, and it should be appealing enough for Bob to accept, avoiding further rounds and the risk of even lower value."
