"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 0 and I'll take the rest. Let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation effect, I propose we split the funds in a way that accounts for its impact over 12 rounds. Here's my proposal. 
# Alice gain: 52.37 
# Bob gain: 47.63 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is considering the inflation effect. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob's proposal takes into account the full impact of inflation, and I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly lower share this round. Let's see if we can find a more equitable split.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60% this round, hoping to get closer to a fair split."
