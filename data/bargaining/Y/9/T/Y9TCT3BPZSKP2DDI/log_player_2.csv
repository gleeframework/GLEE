Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm being generous, but my patience (and the value of this money) is wearing thin. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to give you a larger share to end this, but I need to make sure I get something worthwhile as well.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  Take it or leave it.  The money is literally disappearing before our eyes. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though the offer is not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round. Inflation is making the money less valuable for Alice, but it's still a significant amount. Accepting allows me to secure at least some of the money before it's completely devalued."
