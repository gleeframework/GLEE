"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I've included a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn! Please relay his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time.  Let's settle it now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I initially offered Bob $400,000 and he rejected it, I'm not inclined to accept his counteroffer of $450,000 for myself, especially considering that the value of the money hasn't changed for me.\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let me know the outcome! \n\n###\n\n###\n\nMy next offer will be:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway, but I'm still aiming to get a slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nMy next offer will be:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway, but I'm still aiming to get a slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!



Also, since we are in Round 3, I'll keep in mind that Bob's perceived value of the money has decreased by 20% (10% in Round 2 and another 10% in Round 3). This might affect his decision-making, and I'm hoping he'll be more inclined to accept my offer this time around."
