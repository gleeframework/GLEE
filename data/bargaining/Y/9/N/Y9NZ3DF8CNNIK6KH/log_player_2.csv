Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's split the difference 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to make it seem like she's negotiating, the inflation is working heavily in Bob's favor. Accepting this offer would give Bob less than half of what he could have gotten in the first round, even though his negotiating position has only strengthened. It's worth holding out for a better offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it. A straight 50/50 split. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point.  While Bob has the advantage with inflation, waiting too long could result in a worse outcome if Alice gets desperate. A 50/50 split is fair and gives Alice a strong incentive to accept before her potential earnings dwindle further."
