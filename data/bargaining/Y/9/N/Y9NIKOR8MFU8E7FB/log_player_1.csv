"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a fairly generous offer to see how Bob reacts.  We'll see if he's willing to share, or if he wants to try to get more!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still fairly generous considering the inflation, and it's much better than the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting. It's time to take the deal!"
