"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 20$ and keeping 80$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still not giving up too much. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is kicking in!

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

* If I accept, I'll get 40$ (which is worth 80% of 50, due to 20% inflation from the first round), and Bob will get 60$ (which is worth 90% of 66.67, due to 10% inflation from the first round).

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, the value of the money has decreased further. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 40$ and keeping 60$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up control yet. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Let's calculate the values:

* If I accept, I'll get 45$ (which is worth 90% of 50, due to 20% inflation from the first round, and then 48.8% of 90, due to the additional inflation), and Bob will get 55$ (which is worth 73.1% of 66.67, due to 10% inflation from the first round, and then 27.1% of 73.1, due to the additional inflation).

I'll think for a moment...
