"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. However, I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob to incentivize him to accept the offer early on, considering that the value of the money decreases by 20% for him with each passing round. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and the game can end quickly, benefiting both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value decreases for me each round.  How about a slightly better split for me? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, given the situation, I'm in a stronger negotiating position due to the money not losing value for me. Bob's offer gives him more than half, which is not favorable to me, especially considering the value remains constant for me but decreases for him. I can afford to wait and see if Bob will offer a better split in the next rounds, knowing the decreasing value of the money pressures him more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value for you, this is a fair adjustment""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money's value decreases by 20% for Bob each round and remains constant for me, I'll adjust my offer to reflect this dynamic. By offering 65% for myself and 35% for Bob, I'm still providing him with a substantial amount but also acknowledging the pressure the decreasing value puts on his side. This adjustment aims to encourage Bob to accept the offer before the value drops further for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but this offer needs to reflect the urgency of the situation. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's willingness to meet closer to the middle, the split still doesn't favor me as much as I would like, given the negotiating leverage I have due to the money's constant value for me. With the value decreasing significantly for Bob (now 48.8% less than the first round), I anticipate he will become increasingly eager to settle as the rounds progress, potentially leading to a more favorable offer for me in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Given the significant decrease in value for you, I'm adjusting my offer accordingly""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the money's value has decreased by nearly half for Bob since the first round and remains unchanged for me, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this disparity. By proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, I'm still providing Bob with a considerable amount but also acknowledging the increasing pressure on him due to the diminishing value of the money. This offer aims to strike a balance between my advantageous position and the urgency for Bob to accept before the value drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We need to settle this quickly. This offer is my bottom line. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's assertion that this is his bottom line, the numbers still don't favor me as much as I believe they should, given the significant decrease in value for Bob (now 67.23% less than the first round) and the constant value for me. With Bob's increasing urgency and the substantial loss in value he's facing, I believe there's room for further negotiation that could result in a more favorable split for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Given the extreme decrease in value for you, I'm making a final adjustment""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the money's value has decreased by over 67% for Bob since the first round and remains unchanged for me, I'm making a significant adjustment to my offer. By proposing a 75-25 split in my favor, I'm reflecting the substantial disparity in the value of the money between us. This offer is more aggressive but still provides Bob with a quarter of the original amount, acknowledging the critical need for him to accept before the value diminishes further. Given the urgency and the significant loss in value Bob is facing, I believe this could be the final opportunity for us to reach an agreement."
