{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."

# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm the one proposing. 
# Alice gain: 40

Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's argument, and I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal.
