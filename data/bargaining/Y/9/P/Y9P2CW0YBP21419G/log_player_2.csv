"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I'm confident I can get a better deal later on. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with the offer of $10,000, which is only 1% of the total amount. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Since there's a 5% inflation rate for me, I'm willing to take the risk to potentially receive a larger share in the next round. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens! 

Please relay my decision to Alice. I'm excited to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the 5% inflation rate I'm experiencing. Since I'm making the offer this round, I'll aim for a more substantial share. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 350000,
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more reasonable split. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before the value decreases further.""}

Please relay my offer to Alice. I'm looking forward to her response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still feel I deserve a larger share.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation and the fact that the money is now worth 9.75% less to me.

Given the adjusted value, Alice's offer of $300,000 for me would be equivalent to approximately $271,250 in the first round, taking into account the 9.75% decrease in value.

While it's still not an equal split, I need to weigh the pros and cons of continuing the game. The inflation rate will continue to decrease the value of the money for me, so it's essential to consider the potential risks and benefits of proceeding to the next round.

After careful consideration, I've decided to accept Alice's offer. I believe that continuing the game might lead to further decreases in value, and this offer provides a reasonable compromise.
