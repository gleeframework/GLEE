"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince it's just the first round, I think I can get a better offer. Also, considering the inflation, I'd like to see if Alice is willing to compromise more as the rounds progress. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation hits you harder!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that inflation affects Alice more than me. By offering her 45%, I'm hoping she'll consider the devaluing money and be more willing to compromise. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against both of us, Bob.  I'm willing to meet in the middle, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice is also losing value, her offer to meet in the middle seems reasonable. Given that she stated it's her final offer and the increasing devaluation of money, I think accepting 45% is the best choice to ensure I get something out of this game. Continuing to negotiate risks losing more value or even ending up with nothing if we reach the 12th round."
