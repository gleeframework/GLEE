"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... 

I'll decide to reject it.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a good opportunity to get a decent share. I'll decide to accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
