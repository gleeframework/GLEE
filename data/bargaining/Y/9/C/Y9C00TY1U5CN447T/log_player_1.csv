"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving me 60% of the total amount, but still leaving Bob with a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
