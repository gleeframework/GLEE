"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd be gaining $4,000 and he'd be gaining $6,000. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I think this is a good opportunity for me to take more.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since Bob's gain was $6,000 in the previous round, and it's worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll aim to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

This way, I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob, while still keeping a slight edge for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 4, Bob offered me $3,000 and himself $7,000, which is a significant increase in his share. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to adjust my offer to take advantage of the situation. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keeping a significant edge for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at Bob's offer now! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think I can do even better than this.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With Bob's offer getting progressively smaller due to inflation, I'll aim to make a more aggressive proposal. Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

This is the same offer I made in Round 3, but considering the significant decrease in Bob's offer due to inflation, I think this is a good opportunity for me to take a slightly larger share. Your turn, Bob!"
