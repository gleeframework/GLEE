"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This is a fairly aggressive offer, but it's designed to secure a quick agreement and maximize Alice's share before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for Alice than the initial offer, even accounting for the inflation.  It's in Alice's best interest to reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

Alice is still trying to get a good share of the money, but this offer is more balanced. The offer accounts for the inflation, and is likely to be more appealing to Bob than the previous offer, given that Bob's share decreased drastically in round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, Alice's share has decreased significantly due to inflation. It's still worth rejecting and making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is better than the previous rounds, it's still not a great deal for Alice. It's worth rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. Inflation is heavily impacting the value of the money for both players, so it's crucial to negotiate a fair deal before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Alice needs to keep making concessions to try and secure a deal before inflation eats away at the value of the money even further.  This offer keeps a majority of the money for Alice, but gives Bob a larger share than the previous round. It's a gamble, but it could be enough to persuade Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is worse than Alice's previous offer, it's crucial to consider the impact of inflation. The money is losing value rapidly, and Bob's offer is becoming increasingly favorable to Alice. It's best to accept this offer and secure a share of the money, rather than risk getting nothing at all."
