I'm offering Bob $4,000 and I'll take $6,000. I think this is a reasonable and fair split. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we'll both experience. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less""

I've reduced my share by $200 to account for the inflation, hoping Bob will find this offer more acceptable."
