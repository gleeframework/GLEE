I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm aware of the inflation rate and want to secure a good deal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation and Bob's rejection of my previous offer. Let's end this game!"
