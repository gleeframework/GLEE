"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can shake hands!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this deal and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money closer to 60/40, with me getting the larger share as I'm taking on the risk of rejection in this round.  We can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to give Bob the larger share, especially since he's taking on the risk of rejection. However, I also don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount.

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
