Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a tough start. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor this round.  Let's make a deal and avoid the inflation trap! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
