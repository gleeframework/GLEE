I'm going for a big chunk of the money, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. I figure he might be more risk-averse and take the guaranteed 1000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even though I'm getting less, I know I can still get a better deal in the next round. I'll be the one making the offer, and I can adjust it to account for the inflation on Bob's side."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the fact that Bob is getting a little less due to inflation. I'm still aiming for a large share, but I want to make it tempting enough for him to accept and avoid another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While inflation is hurting Bob more, I still believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll be the one making the offer, and I can adjust it to be more appealing to him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm further lowering my offer, but I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the increasing inflation impacting Bob.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a good opportunity to get a decent share and end the game."
