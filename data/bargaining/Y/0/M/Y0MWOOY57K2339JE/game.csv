5500.0,4500.0,"I understand the situation, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. This is my counter-offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's be reasonable. This is the same split you offered last round, just adjusted for inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"This is a compromise, Bob.  We are both losing money as we go. I need you to meet me halfway.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"Time is running out, Alice. I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer.",Bob,6,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We need to settle this now before inflation eats away at everything. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.",Alice,7,
