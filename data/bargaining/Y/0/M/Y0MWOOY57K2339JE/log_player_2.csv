"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the situation, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This is the same split you offered last round, just adjusted for inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise, Bob.  We are both losing money as we go. I need you to meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about needing to compromise, she's feeling the pressure of inflation far more than Bob.  He can afford to be a little more patient and see if she offers a deal closer to 55/45 in his favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We need to settle this now before inflation eats away at everything. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right. While not ideal, a 50/50 split is better than nothing. With the inflation increasing, Bob's bargaining power is diminishing rapidly.  It's unlikely Alice will offer anything better, and risking further rounds could lead to a complete loss."
