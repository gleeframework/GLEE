"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point?""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but I think we can do better 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the adjusted values are:
My gain: $6000 * 0.8 = $4800 (20% less than the original $6000)
Bob's gain: $4000 * 0.9 = $3600 (10% less than the original $4000)

I'll reject Bob's offer since it's not as favorable to me as my original proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, but I'm willing to give you a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values considering the inflation:

My gain: $5500 * 0.512 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value) = $2808
Bob's gain: $4500 * 0.729 (since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9% of the original value) = $3280.5

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less valuable money.
