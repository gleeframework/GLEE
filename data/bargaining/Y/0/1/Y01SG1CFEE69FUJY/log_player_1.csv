Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept and avoid further rounds. The inflation isn't much in the first round, so the loss for Bob isn't significant. I'm aiming for a quick and decisive win!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, the 50/50 split is a fair offer.  There's a chance Bob might get even greedier in the next round, and the inflation could hurt me. It's better to take the sure thing now."
