"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a reasonable starting point, and I think it's a fair split."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60, I'll give you 20, now it's your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll have to think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. However, I still think I can do better than 20%.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

I'm willing to compromise and take a smaller share of the initial $100, hoping that Bob will see the value in this offer."

# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is even more aggressive than before! I'm not thrilled about getting only 15% of the initial $100, but I have to consider the effects of inflation.

Since the money is worth significantly less now, I'll have to be more realistic about my expectations. However, I still think I can do better than 15%.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting more aggressive again! I'm not thrilled about getting only 10% of the initial $100, but I have to consider the effects of inflation and the fact that the deadline is getting closer.

At this point, I'm not sure if I can do better than 10%. I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth rejecting this offer and risking getting nothing.
