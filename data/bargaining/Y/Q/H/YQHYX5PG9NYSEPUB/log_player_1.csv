This is my first offer. I'm going for a large share, but leaving something for Bob to hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still leaving Bob a significant portion. I hope this will be more appealing, especially considering the inflation factor affecting my gains."
