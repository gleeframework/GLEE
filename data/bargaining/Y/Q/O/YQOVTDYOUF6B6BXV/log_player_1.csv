I'm starting with a generous offer, aiming to secure the deal quickly.  I'm keeping a larger share for myself but still offering Bob a significant amount.  I'm hoping he'll accept, as the inflation will decrease the value of his share in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While the inflation hurts my potential gains, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself. Bob's offer is far too unfavorable, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial offer, taking into account the inflation that has occurred. However, I am still offering a considerable amount, and believe this is a fair deal. I hope Bob will see the value in accepting, as the inflation will continue to decrease the worth of his potential gains in future rounds."
