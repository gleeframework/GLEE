"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in both our interests if we want to maximize our gains.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:** Both Alice and Bob lose value with each passing round due to inflation. Alice loses value at a slower rate (5%) compared to Bob (10%). This gives Alice a time advantage.
* **Strong Initial Offer:** By starting with a 70/30 split in her favor, Alice anchors the negotiation in a position of strength. While it might not be accepted immediately, it sets a clear expectation.
* **Appealing to Rationality:** The message emphasizes that accepting the offer quickly benefits both parties, playing on Bob's potential desire to avoid larger losses due to his faster inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money will decrease in future rounds. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is framed as fair, it significantly favors him. Here's why Alice should reject it:

* **Unfavorable Split:** Bob is proposing a 60/40 split in his favor, even though Alice's money is losing value at a slower rate. 
* **Exploiting Inflation:** Bob's message uses the decreasing value as leverage to pressure Alice into accepting a worse deal. However, Alice still has the time advantage.
* **Potential for Better Offer:** By rejecting, Alice forces Bob into another round. With each round, his share loses value more rapidly, increasing the pressure on him to make a more acceptable offer. 

Alice should reject and counter with a proposal that's closer to the original split but acknowledges the time pressure, aiming for something around 65/35 in her favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money, and we're both losing it. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to reflect the decreasing value, but we need to find a solution quickly. This offer is a compromise that benefits us both.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Time Pressure:**  Alice's message directly addresses the time sensitivity of the situation. This shows she's willing to negotiate realistically but won't be pushed into an unfair deal.
* **Adjusted Offer:** The 65/35 split is a strategic concession. It's slightly less than Alice's initial offer but still significantly better than Bob's proposal. 
* **Urgency and Compromise:** By framing the offer as a ""compromise that benefits us both"", Alice reinforces the need for a swift resolution while subtly reminding Bob that further delays harm him more than her."
