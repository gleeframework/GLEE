"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced offer, let's see if you accept 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm willing to accept it."
