"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. I'm aiming for a large portion for myself, but I want to leave a small incentive for Bob to accept in the first round. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is more generous than my initial proposal, the inflation factor makes it significantly less appealing.  I'm still in a stronger position to negotiate, as I know Bob is likely more risk-averse than I am.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower split than my initial proposal, reflecting the inflation. I believe I can still secure a favorable outcome, but I need to make it worth Bob's while to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I could potentially gain.  Bob's offer, though not ideal, is the best I can reasonably expect at this point. It's time to secure something rather than risk getting nothing."
