"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money. Let's negotiate from here!""
}
```

This offer gives me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my calculation. With a 5% decrease in value, my gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50 in the first round's money. However, since we're in the second round, I need to consider the inflation from the first round as well, making it worth $44.63.

I'm not sure what the inflation effect is on Bob's gain, so I'll just consider the nominal value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is fair, considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less each round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreasing value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly lower share this time, but it's still a fair deal considering the inflation!""
}
```

This offer gives me 55 dollars and Bob 45 dollars, taking into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, but I think it's still a good compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

To calculate the actual value of the offer, I'll need to adjust for the inflation:

* My gain of $40 is worth 85.74% of the original value (100% - 14.26% = 85.74%), so it's actually worth $34.29 in the first round's money.
* Bob's gain of $60 is worth 72.9% of the original value (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%), so it's actually worth $72.9 in the first round's money.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with giving Bob a 60% share, especially considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the increasing inflation and the fact that Bob's share is getting larger, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less each round, and we're in the fifth round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share this time, but I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation!""
}
```

This offer gives me 58 dollars and Bob 42 dollars, taking into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger risk and go for a more uneven split, but I think it's still a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

To calculate the actual value of the offer, I'll need to adjust for the inflation:

* My gain of $30 is worth 77.38% of the original value (100% - 22.62% = 77.38%), so it's actually worth $23.31 in the first round's money.
* Bob's gain of $70 is worth 59.05% of the original value (100% - 40.95% = 59.05%), so it's actually worth $59.05 in the first round's money.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with giving Bob a 70% share, especially considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really getting out of control!

Since the money is worth 22.62% less each round, and we're in the seventh round, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate for the decreasing value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 62,
  ""bob_gain"": 38,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share this time, but I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation!""
