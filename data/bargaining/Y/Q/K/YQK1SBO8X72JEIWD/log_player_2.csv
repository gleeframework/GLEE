"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take a small slice of the pie, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer for Bob. Even though it's the first round, it's not worth it to accept a measly $1000.  Bob should reject and see if he can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but you'll get more in the next round if you accept.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. If you reject it, I'll be forced to take a bigger share in the next round, leaving you with even less. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much better offer for Bob. While the money is worth less due to inflation, he is still getting 100,000. The next round would mean another 20% reduction in value, and potentially an even worse offer from Alice. It's better to take what he can get now."
