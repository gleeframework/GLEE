"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's inflation mechanism."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain in this round still being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer being 50% more than my initial offer, I think I should take it.
