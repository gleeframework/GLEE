This offer gives Alice 60% of the money and Bob 40%. I'm starting with a fairly balanced proposal, but it's important to keep in mind the inflation rates and how they will affect future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer. I will reject and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This offer splits the money evenly between Alice and Bob. It's a more balanced offer than my previous one, and takes into account the inflation rates that are affecting both of us."
