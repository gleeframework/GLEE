"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a straightforward proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and I'm not leaving too much to Bob. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is still worth 100% of the original amount, but Bob's gain is worth 80% of the original amount due to inflation.

Since Bob's offer is actually more favorable to me in terms of the actual value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
