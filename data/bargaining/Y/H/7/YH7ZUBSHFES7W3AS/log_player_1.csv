"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob will accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'll be getting only 40% of the original amount, which is not a good deal considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation again.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but still keep some for myself. Your turn!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm keeping a larger portion for myself to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 2800 
# Bob gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, due to the increased inflation, I'll be getting only 28% of the original amount, which is even worse than before. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the additional 20% inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2240,
  ""bob_gain"": 7760,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I need to make sure I'm not left with nothing. Your turn!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob an even larger share, but I'm still trying to keep some for myself to account for the rapid inflation."
