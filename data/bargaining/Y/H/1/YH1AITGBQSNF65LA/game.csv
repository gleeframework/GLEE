60.0,40.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $60, you get $40. It's important to divide this fairly while the money is still worth something.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. We'll both get a fair share, and we can avoid losing any money to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the idea of a 50/50 split, Bob, remember the money is losing value for you faster. Let's find a solution that benefits us both. I'm willing to negotiate further.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take $55, and you take $45.  It's a slight adjustment, but fair considering the time pressure and inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your position, but I think 55/45 is a fair split given the inflation we're facing. Let's avoid further delays and agree to this.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, you're asking me to take a worse deal than before while the value decreases for you! We need to be realistic. I'm open to a deal, but it needs to reflect the situation.",Alice,4,reject
53.0,47.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my share again to $53. Let's be practical, time is literally money, and we're both losing out. Take the deal!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
47.0,53.0,"Alice, I'm willing to give in slightly more to get this done. Let's split it 53/47.  This is a fair compromise considering the time pressure and inflation we're both facing.",Bob,6,
,,"This is getting frustrating, Bob! You're still trying to take advantage even though the clock is ticking and the money is losing value for you. I'm being more than fair.  Let's be reasonable and reach an actual compromise.",Alice,6,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. I'm taking a smaller cut again at $52, giving you $48.  We are running out of time, and this is the most reasonable deal you'll get. Let's end this before we both lose out.",Alice,7,
