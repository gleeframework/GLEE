"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn to be generous... sort of 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd get $300,000 and he'd get $700,000. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll have the same value as before, but for Bob, the money is worth 5% less than in the first round.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to aim for a better split. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the 'generosity', but I'm not ready to give up yet!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Middle ground, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a balance between our previous offers."
