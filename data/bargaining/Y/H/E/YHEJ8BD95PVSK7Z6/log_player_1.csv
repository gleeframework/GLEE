"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm aiming to get the most I can in the first round, knowing the money will be worth less for Bob in the future rounds.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than my first offer, but I'm still in a good position. The inflation will hurt him more than me in the next round, so I'll reject and see if he'll offer me more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I still think this is a good deal for Bob. He's getting more than in Round 1, and the inflation will continue to hurt him more than me. I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer."

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding onto a significant portion of the money.  With inflation working against him, I believe this offer is reasonable.  Bob is likely getting desperate now, and this is a good opportunity to secure a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm dropping my offer slightly again, but I'm still in a strong position. The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and he's running out of time. I'm hoping he'll see the value in taking this offer before it's too late for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting really bad now, and inflation is working heavily against him.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. It's time to see how desperate Bob is getting!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time, but I still think this is a fair deal for Bob.  He's going to lose out on a lot of money if he rejects, and he only has a few rounds left. It's time to see if he'll finally cave."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely low, but I'm still holding out hope.  We're running out of time, but I'm confident I can still get a better deal in the next round.  He's likely feeling the pressure of the dwindling time and inflation, and I'm going to stick to my guns."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

This is my final offer. We're down to the wire, and I'm willing to give a little more, but this is the best I can do. The inflation is really starting to take its toll on Bob. I think he's going to have to accept this offer to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

It's a shame, but I'm going to reject Bob's final offer. While it's incredibly low, it's not worth getting a tiny amount when we both could have walked away with a decent sum earlier. The pressure of the clock and the inflation have clearly pushed Bob into a desperate position, but I refuse to be exploited.  We're both walking away with nothing, but I stand by my decision."
