Alice's offer:

Let's see how the game progresses. I'm willing to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I believe a more balanced split is in order.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both get a fair share, and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Although I could try to negotiate for a slightly larger share, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. Accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is a reasonable outcome."
