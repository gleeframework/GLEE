"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have it all, let's start with a 60-40 split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's money being worth 5% less, I'm better off accepting this offer. I'll take the 400,000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
