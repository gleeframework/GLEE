Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure, Bob, but I need a better deal than that.  63/37, and let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take what I can get at this point!  The inflation is starting to hurt."
