Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll, and I'm trying to find a middle ground that accounts for the loss in value. Let's compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is acknowledging the inflation, his offer is still not favorable to me.  Here's why:

* **My disadvantage is increasing:** With each round, the inflation disparity grows. My losses are less than Bob's, meaning time is on my side.
* **Holding strong:** By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better share and Bob needs to make more significant concessions.
* **Future offers:**  Bob will likely be more desperate to make a deal in the next round as the inflation further erodes his potential gain. I'm betting on getting a better offer in Round 5."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at this deal. I'm willing to adjust slightly to end this, but this is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've slightly lowered my initial demand to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept. This makes my offer more enticing without conceding too much.
* **Time Pressure:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob.  He knows that if he rejects this, the next round will likely favor me even more.
* **Balancing Act:** This offer aims to find a balance between maximizing my gain and ensuring Bob finds it acceptable. This increases the likelihood of ending the game in this round."
