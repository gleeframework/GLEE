Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, let's meet closer to the middle, 58-42 is a fairer split considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, 57-43 is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's end this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

```

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. While the offer isn't ideal, accepting guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting and hoping for a better deal in the later rounds is too risky."
