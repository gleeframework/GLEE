"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, but I'll take a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

For me, $300,000 is now worth 90% of $300,000, which is $270,000.
For Bob, $700,000 is now worth 80% of $700,000, which is $560,000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather not give Bob such a large share of the remaining money.
