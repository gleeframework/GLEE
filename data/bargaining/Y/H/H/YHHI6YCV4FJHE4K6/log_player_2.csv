Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While a 57/43 split seems tempting, it's getting worse for me every round. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't offer something closer to fair."

Round 6

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a good deal 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While not ideal, taking $44 is better than risking getting zero if we don't reach a deal. Alice knows I'm desperate now."
