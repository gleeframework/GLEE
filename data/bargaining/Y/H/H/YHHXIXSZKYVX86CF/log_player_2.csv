Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my last offer. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I won't go any lower. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are really starting to hurt. While ideally, I'd want a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action for a few reasons:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Each round, the value of my potential gain decreases significantly. Waiting any longer means accepting even less.
* **Alice's Stance:** She's labeled this her ""last offer"" twice now. It's unlikely she'll budge further, and pushing to round 6 might make her even less willing to negotiate.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:**  Accepting now guarantees me $50,000 (even though it's worth less than at the start). Rejecting risks getting nothing at all if I misjudge Alice's resolve.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but in this scenario, cutting my losses and taking the offer is the most logical choice.
