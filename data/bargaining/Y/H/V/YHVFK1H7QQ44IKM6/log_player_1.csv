"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can try to do better next time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800
* Bob gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200

I'll accept this offer since it's a better deal than the one I made in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
