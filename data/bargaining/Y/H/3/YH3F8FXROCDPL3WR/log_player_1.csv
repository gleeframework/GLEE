"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting that we can stop here if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal for you 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'm hoping to get a higher share of the money, especially considering the value of the money I gain is decreasing with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the value of the money I gain is decreasing with each round, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this round, but it's still a fair deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to his original offer from round 2, but with a slight adjustment. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. The value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and getting an even smaller share. This offer is still better than what I'd get in the next round."
