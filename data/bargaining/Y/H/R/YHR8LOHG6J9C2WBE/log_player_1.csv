**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:**  Alice's money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round. This means even a smaller amount for her is better than potentially getting nothing in the next round due to further inflation.
* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob is offering Alice $60, which is still better than the potential $0 she could get if she rejects and inflation continues.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Alice might want more, the risk of further inflation outweighs the potential for a larger share in the future. Accepting the offer ensures a guaranteed gain."
