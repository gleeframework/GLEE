"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly biased towards me, split.  I'm willing to negotiate further if you think it's too lopsided. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it's too biased towards Alice. I'm hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more balanced, but still slightly in my favor. I'll also remind Alice that the value of the money decreases for her with each passing round.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Remember, each round costs you 5%!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go, and it avoids the risk of losing money due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer since it's a fair 50/50 split, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal.
