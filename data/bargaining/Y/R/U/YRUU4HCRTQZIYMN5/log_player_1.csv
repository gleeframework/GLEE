"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to keep 9000$ for myself and give Bob 1000$. I believe this is a fair offer as it gives Bob a chance to get something even though he's not proposing first.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share to 8000$ and increasing Bob's to 2000$. I hope this shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a fair share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is still being too stubborn.  I'll reject his offer again. Even though my potential gain is shrinking, I believe I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. I'm offering Bob 3000$, which is a significant increase from his previous offer."
