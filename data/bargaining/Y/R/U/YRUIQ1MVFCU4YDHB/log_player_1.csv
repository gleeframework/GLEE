"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's finish the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a decent share, let's move on 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to consider the long-term implications of this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now and proceed to Round 3, where I'll make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority this time, you can still get a decent share, but I need to be more aggressive to get a good deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping it's enough to get a good deal considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller majority, but I still want to keep the upper hand 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain of 450,000 is worth the same as 450,000 in the first round, which is approximately $450,000.
Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 14.26% less than 600,000 (his gain in round 2), which is approximately $514,115.

Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
