"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, a fair starting point. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a generous starting offer, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a better deal 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $700,000 in Round 2 is worth $560,000 in Round 1's dollars.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It's a better deal than the one I initially proposed, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think this is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a slightly more favorable split for Bob, but I'm trying to hold my ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is my limit 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $550,000 in Round 4 is worth $416,000 in Round 1's dollars.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It's a slightly better deal than the one I initially proposed, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5

  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'll meet you in the middle. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. I'm not willing to give up more than this, so it's up to Bob to decide."
