"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money 70/30. This gives you a decent share and avoids the risk of losing everything with further delays. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer. Let's make a deal and avoid further rounds of risk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly. My 70/30 offer was fair, and your counter-proposal didn't reflect the urgency. I'm willing to compromise slightly with 75/25, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing at all with further rounds. The value is decreasing rapidly, and it's crucial to secure some gain."
