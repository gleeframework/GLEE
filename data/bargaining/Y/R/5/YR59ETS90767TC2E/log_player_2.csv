Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know the money's value is dropping for you, but I can wait. This is my best offer yet. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The longer the game goes on, the less favorable the outcome for Bob. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $42 (which is worth significantly less than $42 due to inflation) is better than risking an even lower offer in future rounds. Alice clearly understands the game dynamics and is willing to wait for Bob to become more desperate."
