"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nIn this proposal, Alice is offering to take $55 and give Bob $45. She includes a message suggesting that this division is fair, but slightly in her favor. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer, as the game's rules state that the money's value decreases with each passing round. By accepting this offer, Bob would receive $45, which would be worth more in the first round than in subsequent rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for us to split the money evenly. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer to split the money evenly, with Bob taking $55 and Alice taking $45. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the effects of inflation, Alice may believe she can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds or may not want to accept a smaller share due to the decreased value of the money. By rejecting the offer, Alice is choosing to proceed to the next round, where she will make a new proposal to divide the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\nIn this proposal, Alice is offering to take $52 and give Bob $48. She includes a message suggesting that they meet in the middle, taking into account the effects of inflation on the value of the money. By proposing this division, Alice is attempting to find a compromise that Bob might accept, given that the money's value decreases with each passing round. This offer is also slightly in Alice's favor, as she is trying to maximize her gain while still being reasonable."
