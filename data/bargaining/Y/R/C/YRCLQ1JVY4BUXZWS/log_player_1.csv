"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, let's settle this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous in the first round, I'll meet you in the middle this time! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 500,000$ I would gain in this round is actually worth 475,000$ (95% of 500,000$). 

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair deal, and I'm willing to accept it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
