"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose keeping the vast majority of the money for myself, as the first round offers the best chance of getting a good deal. I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept, hoping he'll underestimate the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's a better deal than the first round, it's still not very good.  I am confident that I can get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, still keeping the majority for myself, but giving Bob a little more to potentially incentivize him to accept. I'm betting that he's still feeling the sting of the last round's rejection and might be more open to a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Bob's offer keeps getting worse, as the effect of inflation on his side becomes more pronounced. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again, trying to find a balance between a decent share for myself and enough to potentially entice Bob.  The inflation is really starting to hurt his side, and I want to see if I can capitalize on that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse due to inflation, and I'm still confident I can secure a better deal.  I'm going to keep holding out, hoping to see his offer drop even further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again. I'm confident I can get a better deal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds remaining. I want to see if a slightly more generous offer can get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than the first round due to inflation, but it's approaching a point where the potential gains from waiting might be outweighed by the risk of getting nothing. I'm going to hold out for one more round and see if I can get a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500} 
```

I'm raising my offer again, recognizing that Bob's offer is now becoming more attractive due to the inflation.  I'm aiming for a compromise that allows for a decent amount for myself while also ensuring that Bob gets a fair share in this rapidly inflating situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, the inflation has severely impacted Bob's side, and the risk of getting nothing in the remaining rounds is too high. Accepting this 50/50 split is the best option available to me at this point."
