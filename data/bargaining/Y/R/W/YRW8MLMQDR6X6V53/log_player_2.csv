It's not a good deal for Bob. He's getting nothing.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This is a good deal for Bob, even though Alice's offer is significantly lower due to inflation.  It's better to get 50 dollars than to risk getting nothing at all."
