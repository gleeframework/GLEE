"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

Since Bob's offer is still more favorable to him than my initial offer, and the value of his gain is lower due to inflation, I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
