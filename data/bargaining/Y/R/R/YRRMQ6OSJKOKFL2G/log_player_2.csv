"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to accept an even split, but there are 12 rounds and the money is losing value.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to offer more to get a deal done sooner."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that we have multiple rounds, and the value of the money is decreasing with each round. It's a fair compromise that allows us to secure some gains early on.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in your favor. I think it's a fair compromise considering the inflation and the remaining rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is significant, and it's unlikely Alice will offer more. Accepting this offer ensures I get something while the value is still relatively high."
