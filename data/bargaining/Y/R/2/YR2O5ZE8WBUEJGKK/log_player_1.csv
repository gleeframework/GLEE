"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```
This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my perception of the offer.

In this case, my gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 remains the same.

I'll decide to reject this offer, as I'd like to aim for a higher gain to compensate for the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```
This way, I'll get 75% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my potential gain in Round 4, considering the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my perception of the offer.

In the first round, $450,000 was 45% of the initial $1,000,000. With 14.26% less value due to inflation, my gain of $450,000 is equivalent to approximately 38.8% of the original $1,000,000.

Considering this, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
