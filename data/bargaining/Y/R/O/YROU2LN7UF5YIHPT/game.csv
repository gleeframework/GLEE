6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think we can do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's start with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point considering the inflation. We can adjust it in the next round if needed.,Bob,2,
,,I'm not sure about the 55/45 split. I'd like to propose a 58/42 split in my favor in the next round.,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share. Let's try 58/42.",Alice,3,
