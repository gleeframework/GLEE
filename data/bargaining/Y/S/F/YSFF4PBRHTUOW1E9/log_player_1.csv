I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This ensures a large portion for myself while still offering Bob something in the first round.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial proposal. While the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll reject this offer and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Bob. I'm still prioritizing a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid losing everything due to the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite unfavorable, even with the inflation factor. He's offering me a mere $2,000, while keeping $8,000 for himself.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm getting increasingly concerned about inflation, but I'm still aiming for a decent share. This time, I'm offering $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob. It's a compromise, but hopefully, it's enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still heavily in his favor, even with the significant inflation impact on him.  While the money is worth less, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is getting serious! Inflation is hitting us both hard, but I'm still hoping for a decent share. This time, I'm offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. We're getting closer to a 50/50 split, hopefully, this is enough to convince him."
