"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 80% of $450,000, or $360,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to give up that much, Bob. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72, but since the money is worth 80% of 90% of the original, it's 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72, but since we are 2 rounds in, it's 0.8*0.9*0.9 = 0.648 so I'll round to 64% of the original, 640,000 is the value of 1,000,000 in this round)

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's split it 55-45.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, let's try 50-50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is now worth 51.2% of its original value (1 - 0.488 = 0.512, but since we are 4 rounds in, it's 0.512 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.345, so I'll round to 35% of the original, 350,000 is the value of 1,000,000 in this round)

However, considering the offer, I'll accept the 50-50 split, as it's a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've convinced me. 50-50 it is!""
}
```"
