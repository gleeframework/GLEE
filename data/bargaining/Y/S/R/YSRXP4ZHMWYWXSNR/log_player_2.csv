Alice's offer:

I'll wait for a better offer. The current offer gives me 40% of the money, but I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll try to get a higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n### Assistant:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  With inflation, a 50/50 split seems fair.  No more haggling, let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Assistant:

### 

I'll accept this offer. Although the money is worth 19% less for me now, a 50/50 split seems reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I don't think I can get a significantly better deal in the next round, and the loss in value due to inflation might outweigh any potential gains from further negotiation. It's time to end the game and settle for the current offer."
