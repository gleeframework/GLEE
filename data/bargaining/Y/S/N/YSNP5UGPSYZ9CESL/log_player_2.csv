Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Inflation is a concern, but so is getting a reasonable share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation significantly devalues the money. This is the most logical choice. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
