5200.0,4800.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, especially considering the inflation. I propose a 52/48 split in your favor as a counter-offer. This ensures we both lose less to inflation.",Bob,2,

5400.0,4600.0,"Alice, we're approaching a point where further negotiation might hurt us both more than it helps. I'm proposing a 54/46 split. This recognizes your smaller inflation rate while still giving me a reasonable share.",Bob,4,
