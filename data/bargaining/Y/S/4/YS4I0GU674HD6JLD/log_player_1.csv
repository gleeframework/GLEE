"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll take 80, you can take 20.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. This is a relatively fair share, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get something rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds."
