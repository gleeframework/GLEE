"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to consider this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share!

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting his offer because I think 20% of the original amount is still too low for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and still getting a reasonable amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small token of appreciation, but I'm still the one who deserves the majority 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation to get the majority!

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting his offer because 1000 is not a decent consolation prize, considering the significant difference in value due to inflation. I'd like to propose another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to take home something substantial to make this worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a bigger share and getting a decent amount for myself, considering the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny crumb, but I'm taking the lion's share 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more and more greedy!

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting his offer because 500 is an insultingly small amount, considering the significant difference in value due to inflation. I'd like to propose another counteroffer, but I'm starting to think I should just stick to my guns and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting tired of your lowball offers. I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm trying to be firm but still willing to compromise, hoping that Bob will finally accept a reasonable offer."
