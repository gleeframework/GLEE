Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is a fair starting point,  given the inflation we need to consider.  Let's get this done quickly! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 51/49 split, but I understand the need to consider inflation. I'll think about it for a moment...

Round 3

I'm willing to give in a bit and offer a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will consider it a reasonable compromise."
