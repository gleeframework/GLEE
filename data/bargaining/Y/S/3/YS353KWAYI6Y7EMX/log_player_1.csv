"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain in the current round:

$80 (initial offer) x 0.9 (10% less) = $72

And since the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, his gain is:

$80 (initial offer) x 0.95 (5% less) = $76

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to propose a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining $45."
