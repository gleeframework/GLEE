Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Alice, I'll aim for a higher share for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"

# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, Alice's offer is still quite generous. I'll think carefully before making a decision.
