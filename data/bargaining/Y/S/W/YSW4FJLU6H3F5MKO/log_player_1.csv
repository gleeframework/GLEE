"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my first offer, I propose to keep 9000$ and Bob gets 1000$. I aim for a larger share because I'm disadvantaged by the higher inflation rate.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing out on a bit more money due to inflation, taking 5000$ is better than risking getting nothing in the end.  It's a fair deal, and I don't want to push my luck!"
