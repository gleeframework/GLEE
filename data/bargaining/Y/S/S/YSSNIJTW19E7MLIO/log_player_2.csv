"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 45, and I'll take 55.  We can work out a better deal in the future if we both play it smart! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 

Let's see how Alice reacts and if she's willing to make a more balanced offer in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be more equitable this round. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, given the inflation we're both facing.  If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we risk getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the fairest outcome we're likely to get at this point. Continuing to play risks us both walking away with nothing due to inflation."
