"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $25. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60:40 split in my favor.  While the money is losing value, we both still benefit more from getting a larger share now than waiting for a potentially smaller share in the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and aiming for an equitable distribution, I propose a 60:40 split. This maintains a balance while also taking into account the diminishing value of money in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
