"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

This offer gives me the majority of the money while still leaving Bob with a small share.  Since it's the first round, I'm hoping he'll accept it.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round. Accepting this offer secures at least some money, while the risk of rejecting it might mean getting nothing at all.  Let's see if Bob will accept my offer next round!"
