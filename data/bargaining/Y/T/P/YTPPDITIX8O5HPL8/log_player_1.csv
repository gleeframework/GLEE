Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll be willing to accept it in the first round.  I'm taking advantage of the inflation that hurts him more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The inflation hurts my potential gains in later rounds. Getting half is a decent outcome considering the circumstances."
