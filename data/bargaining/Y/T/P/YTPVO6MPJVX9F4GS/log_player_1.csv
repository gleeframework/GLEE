"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob. This way, we both get a significant share, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is intended to convey my intention of finding a mutually acceptable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but this needs to be more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same for me in every round, I don't have an incentive to rush into an agreement. Additionally, Bob's offer of $4500 for me is lower than what I initially proposed for myself ($6000), and I'm willing to negotiate further to try to get closer to my initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering his previous message and taking into account that the money is worth 10% less for him in each round. I'll propose $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob, which is a bit closer to his previous offer but still favorable to me. The message ""Considering your generosity"" acknowledges Bob's previous message and shows that I'm willing to listen and adjust my proposal accordingly.\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering your generosity""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's message suggesting it's a fair split, the amount he's offering me ($4900) is still lower than what I've previously proposed for myself. Given that the money is worth the same for me in every round, I don't feel pressured to accept an offer that doesn't meet my expectations. Additionally, since Bob is experiencing a decrease in the value of his potential gain due to inflation, I believe he may become more willing to compromise in future rounds.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make another offer that slightly adjusts my previous proposal. Considering the effects of inflation on Bob's potential gain, I'll propose $5700 for myself and $4300 for Bob. The message ""Inflation is costing you"" is a gentle reminder to Bob that the longer we negotiate, the less valuable his potential gain becomes, which might encourage him to accept my offer or make a more favorable counteroffer.\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Inflation is costing you""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. Although I initially aimed for a higher amount, considering the message ""This is my final offer"" suggests that Bob is unwilling to compromise further. Given the significant decrease in value for Bob's potential gain due to inflation (40.95% less than the first round), I believe he is more likely to stand firm on this offer. Accepting this proposal guarantees me $5000, which is a considerable amount, rather than risking further negotiations that might not yield a better outcome, especially since we are halfway through the 12 rounds."
