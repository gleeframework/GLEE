"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer reflects the initial value before inflation impacts it. I propose we divide the money 4:1 in favor of Bob, considering the future value reduction. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a good deal right now, the inflation rate means that I'll lose more value than Alice in future rounds.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, considering the inflation rates will impact your share more heavily than mine in the future rounds. This ensures a more equitable outcome for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rates and aiming for a fair distribution, I propose we divide the money 6:4. This maintains a balance while accounting for the diminishing value of our shares in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Although Alice's proposal is still a bit lopsided, the inflation rate is working against me now.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's likely that if I reject it, Alice will continue to propose similar splits that favor her more, and I may end up with even less in later rounds."
