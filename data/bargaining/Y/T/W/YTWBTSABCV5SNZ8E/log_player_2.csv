"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I expect you to accept this offer in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal in the first round.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round.  Let's see how her generosity changes with the pressure of a potential counter-offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. This offer reflects the value we both stand to lose if we keep rejecting proposals.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer is closer to what I believe is fair. Let's end this game before we both lose more money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It looks like we've reached a more equitable compromise. Even though the money is worth less now, accepting this offer means we both get a decent amount. Let's end this game and move on."
