I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. This is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount to work with."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 10% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal. Since Bob is trying to be more balanced, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive.
