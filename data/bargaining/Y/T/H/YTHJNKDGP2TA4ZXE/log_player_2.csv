"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's proposal sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Bob.  It makes more sense for Bob to wait for a larger share, as the money will devalue more quickly for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, so let's shift towards a more immediately favorable split for you.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

This offer is a counter-proposal to Alice's, acknowledging the inflation while still aiming for a larger share for Bob. It's crucial to incentivize Alice to accept sooner rather than later.  This offer is a significant improvement for her over waiting, even considering one round of devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground considering the increasing inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still not advantageous for Bob. While it's closer to a middle ground, Bob's superior inflation rate means he can afford to be more patient. There's a good chance Alice will offer a larger sum in the next round to avoid further devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is diminishing quickly. I'm proposing a split that heavily favors me, but it's the best offer you'll get at this point considering the rapid devaluation on your end.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a bold move designed to capitalize on Alice's increasingly desperate situation. The offer heavily favors Bob, but it's designed to force Alice's hand. The message is blunt about the situation, emphasizing the rapid devaluation she faces. This might be enough to push her into accepting a less favorable deal rather than risking even greater losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rapid value loss, I'm willing to compromise slightly more but still aim for a relatively fair split. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offer reflects that. However, it's still not enough.  While a 475,000 split seems close to half, the devaluation heavily favors Bob. He can afford to hold out for a better offer, knowing that Alice is feeling immense pressure to settle before her share diminishes further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's becoming clear that we have different ideas of fair. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.  Each round that passes costs you significantly more than me.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law. This offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor, but it's designed to be a final ultimatum. The message is direct and firm, leaving no room for misinterpretation. By framing it as non-negotiable, Bob increases the pressure on Alice. She's now faced with a stark choice: accept a smaller share now or risk losing even more as the rounds progress. This tactic, while aggressive, might be necessary to secure a favorable outcome for Bob given Alice's previous reluctance to offer acceptable terms."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Despite the heavy loss in value for me, I propose an equal split to ensure fairness and to pressure a decision. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally making a sensible offer.  While an even split at the start would have been rejected, the significant devaluation she's experienced makes this acceptable now. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, waiting any longer carries a significant risk for Bob. The longer the game goes on, the more his potential winnings decrease.
* **Devaluation Factor:**  While Bob is losing value, Alice's losses are far greater.  This offer is likely the best he'll get at this point.
* **Guaranteed Payout:** Rejecting this offer risks Alice becoming completely desperate and offering even less, or worse, running out of time, leaving both parties with nothing. 

Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable payout and avoids the potential for a worse outcome."
