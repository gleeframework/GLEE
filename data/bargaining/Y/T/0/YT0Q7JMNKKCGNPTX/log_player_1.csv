"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a risky strategy, but it's the best way to maximize my potential winnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and the inflation rate makes it likely that I won't get a better offer in the next round."
