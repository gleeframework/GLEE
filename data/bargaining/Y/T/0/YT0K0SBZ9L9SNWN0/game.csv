5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, this is getting risky. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but we need to close this soon. $5,600 for me and $4,400 for you is fair considering the rapid inflation.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, considering the inflation is hitting me harder, I think a slight adjustment in my favor is reasonable. This way, we both still walk away with a decent amount, but it compensates for the higher devaluation on my end.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer we wait, the less we both get. I'm offering a slight concession at $5,300 for me and $4,700 for you.  Let's be reasonable and end this.",Alice,5,
