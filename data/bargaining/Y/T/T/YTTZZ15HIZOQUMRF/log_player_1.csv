"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob a small share to get the ball rolling and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I think it's a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the risk of him rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, taking 600,000 is better than nothing, especially with the risk of inflation."
