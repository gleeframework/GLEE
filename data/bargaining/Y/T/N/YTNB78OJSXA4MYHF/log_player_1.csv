"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think your initial offer was too generous. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I want a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","After the inflation, my $800,000 is now worth $640,000 (80% of 800,000), and Bob's $200,000 is now worth $190,000 (95% of 200,000).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving him a 700,000 share, especially since it's worth 3.68 times what it was in the first round. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
