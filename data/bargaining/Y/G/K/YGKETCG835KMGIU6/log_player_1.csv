"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9000 for myself and give Bob $1000. This is a fair starting point, as I am taking the risk of proposing first. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get now. Bob's offer, while not ideal, is still a significant amount of money.  It's also unclear how inflation will affect future rounds, so accepting this offer seems like the best option."
