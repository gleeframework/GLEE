"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, my gain of 20$ is now worth 16$ (80% of 20$) and Bob's gain of 80$ is now worth 76$ (95% of 80$).

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```

This way, I'm aiming to get a slightly higher share of the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 15$ is worth 7.74$ (48.8% of 15.88, which is 15 * 0.768, but we need to correct for the 5% less for Bob, so it's 15 * 0.768 * 0.95 = 14.106, then 14.106 * 0.768 = 10.81, then 10.81 * 0.95 = 10.263, then 10.263 * 0.768 = 7.87, and finally 7.87 * 0.95 = 7.4735, so we round down to 7.47) 
Bob's gain of 85$ is worth 76.38$ (85 * 0.895, 5% less than 100%).

I'll accept this offer.
