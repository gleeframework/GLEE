"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is the same as mine in the first round, I'll reject it.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 will be:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This time, I'll aim for a slightly lower percentage for myself to account for the inflation."
