Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive split in the first round. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share, or if he'll risk it all for a chance to propose in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep a larger share, the inflation is already starting to take its toll. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting and potentially facing an even worse offer in the next round."
