"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next?""
}
```

This offer suggests that we both get $500,000 each, with a message to Bob to see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll take a bit more this round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $300,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I don't like the fact that Bob is taking a larger share this round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, my share of $300,000 is now worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of the original amount. I'll aim to take a larger share this round to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Taking a bit more this round, considering the inflation""

Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $450,000 from the previous round is now worth 85.74% of the original amount. I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I feel it's still too skewed towards his favor.

Round 5
