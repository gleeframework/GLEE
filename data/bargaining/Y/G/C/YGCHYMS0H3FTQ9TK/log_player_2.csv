"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation.
###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is a factor for both of us, so a 50/50 split seems like the best solution to ensure we both get a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI accept the 50/50 split. Considering the increasing impact of inflation, it's reasonable to settle on an equal division to minimize further loss of value."
