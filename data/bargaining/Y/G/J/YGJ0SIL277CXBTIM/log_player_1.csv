"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, given the inflation rates.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to flip the script!

I'll have to consider the effects of inflation. With a 10% decrease in value for me and a 5% decrease for Bob, my gain of 400,000 is actually worth 360,000, and Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 570,000.

I'm not too thrilled about this proposal, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I still think 55% is a fairer split, considering the inflation rates.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, but still offering Bob a decent chunk of the money. Your turn, Bob!"
