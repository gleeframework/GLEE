"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think we should split the money more evenly. This offer considers the time value of money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor. It's worth rejecting and seeing if we can negotiate a better deal.
* **Round 2 Offer:** A 55/45 split in Bob's favor is still a strong offer for Alice to consider.
* **Time Value of Money:** By mentioning the ""time value of money,"" Bob subtly reminds Alice that delaying further will only reduce the overall pot due to inflation. This adds a layer of urgency for Alice to accept a reasonable offer sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, accepting this offer would still mean Bob loses out significantly compared to what he could have gained in Round 1. It's worth pushing Alice a bit further, knowing that the pot will continue to shrink."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both lose out the least due to inflation. ""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By framing this as his ""final offer,"" Bob creates a sense of urgency and seriousness. 
* **50/50 Split:**  This is the most logical and fair division, especially considering the shrinking pot. 
* **Emphasis on Inflation:**  Bob again highlights the risk of continued inflation, making it clear that rejecting this offer will only hurt them both."
