"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This offer aims to secure a good initial deal. It is a fair division in the current round, and will encourage Bob to accept, as he will see a potential loss in value if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the initial offer was fair, inflation has shifted the value in favor of Bob.  By rejecting this offer, I can force Bob to make a more favorable offer in the next round, as the value of his proposed gains will continue to decline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

**Explanation:**

The inflation has been significant, and Bob's value has decreased even further. By offering a 50/50 split, I am offering a fair deal in the current round. This may encourage Bob to accept, as he will likely see his gains decreasing further in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

Inflation has continued to devalue Bob's potential gains significantly.  By rejecting this offer, I can force Bob to make a more favorable offer in the next round. His proposed gains are becoming increasingly less valuable, which puts pressure on him to accept a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer aims to maximize my gains while still being somewhat reasonable.  Bob's potential gains are now significantly less due to the compounding inflation, making him more likely to accept a slightly less favorable split.  If he rejects this offer, he risks losing even more value in the next round."
