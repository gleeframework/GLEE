"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $300,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $285,000. And Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $630,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I think I can do better. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'm willing to give you a bit more""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to meet Bob in the middle, but giving him a slightly larger share to try to get the deal done."
