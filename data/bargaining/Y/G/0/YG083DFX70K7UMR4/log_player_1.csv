  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair start. Now it's his turn!"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal.

```

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 55:45 split. It's still not in my favor, and I think I can do better.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm willing to accept a 50:50 split. It's a fair compromise, and it's better than going into further rounds with decreasing value of the money.

}
```
