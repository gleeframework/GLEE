"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can both get our share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to reverse the roles from my first offer! I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer. My current offer is still on the table, but I'll wait to see if Bob will come back with a better one.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation kicking in, I need to adjust my offer to account for the decreased value of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this time, but still a decent chunk of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is sticking to his guns! I'll think about it...

Hmm, considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal for me, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less valuable money.
