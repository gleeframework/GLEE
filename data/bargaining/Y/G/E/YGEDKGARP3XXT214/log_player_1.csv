Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

However, I notice that Bob's offer is similar to the one he made in Round 2, which I rejected. I'll have to consider whether the slight decrease in value is enough to make it more appealing.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money, and I need to adjust my strategy accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering a larger share to myself, but I think the decreasing value of the money makes it more necessary to try to get a bigger slice of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
