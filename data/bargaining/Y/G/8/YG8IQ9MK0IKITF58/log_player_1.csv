Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but this split is much fairer.  Don't forget the money loses value for me with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a good deal. This offer is a compromise, and the clock is ticking for me! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are getting worse for him with each round due to inflation. He's trying to frame his offer as a compromise, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's the same as my last offer, but the inflation is only hurting you now.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He's now passed the point where accepting my offer would have been better than his initial offer in round 2. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping he'll realize that accepting now is his best bet before the inflation eats away even more of his potential gains."
