"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more.""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a division where I take $60 and Bob takes $40. Given the rules of the game, where each round decreases the value of the money, starting with a slightly higher offer for myself seems strategic. It gives room for negotiation while considering the impact of inflation. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" aims to set a tone for the negotiation, suggesting that while I'm taking more, it's still within a realm of fairness considering the game's progression and the fact that I'm making the first offer.\n\n###\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time.  I'll take a bit more, but we'll both get a better share than before. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Given the adjusted values due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean I get significantly less value compared to the first round, and less than Bob, which doesn't align with my initial strategy of starting with a higher offer for myself to account for future negotiations and inflation impacts. Rejecting gives me the opportunity to counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a more favorable division considering the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a division slightly closer to my original offer but still more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal. Given the impact of inflation, the actual value we both receive decreases, so I'm aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob while still considering my strategic position. The message highlights the consideration of inflation's impact, suggesting that this offer is a compromise given the changing value of the money.\n\n###\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for a 50/50 split. We both lose value with each round, so let's avoid that and just split the money fairly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, especially for me, continuing to negotiate risks losing even more value. A 50/50 split at this point represents a fair division considering the impacts of inflation on both of us. Accepting this offer ensures that we both receive a tangible amount rather than risking further devaluation or potentially ending up with nothing if the rounds continue without agreement.\n\n###\nLet's settle on this fair split and conclude the game!"
