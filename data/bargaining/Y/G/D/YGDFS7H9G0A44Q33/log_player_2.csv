Let's see if we can do better."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting late in the game and inflation is hurting my gains. This seems like a decent compromise."
