Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it 60/40, but with me getting the larger share this time.  This ensures we both get a good start and encourages a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Let's see if we can get a better deal! Bob's offer is getting worse for me with the inflation."
