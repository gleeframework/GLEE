50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. We're both losing money with every round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Let's be rational about this.",Bob,4,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, I understand the need to be rational, but 50/50 isn't taking into account the faster rate of inflation on your end.  I'm willing to meet closer to the middle with 60/40. This ensures we both walk away with something worthwhile.",Alice,5,
