"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll take the smaller share""}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the larger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob is taking the larger share, I'm not thrilled about it, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not sure if 40 is a good deal for me considering the inflation.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to make a counteroffer.

I'm offering Bob a 50-50 split, hoping that it will be more appealing to him."
