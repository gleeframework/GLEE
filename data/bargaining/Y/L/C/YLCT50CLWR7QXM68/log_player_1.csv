"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the offer is now:

# Alice gain: 4000 (worth 95% of the original 5000)
# Bob gain: 6000 (worth 80% of the original 7500)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself to account for the increasing value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

# Alice gain: 3500 (worth 70.00% of the original 5000)
# Bob gain: 6500 (worth 86.67% of the original 7500)

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually a relatively good deal for me, as the value of my gain is higher than the original 50/50 split. I'll accept this offer.
