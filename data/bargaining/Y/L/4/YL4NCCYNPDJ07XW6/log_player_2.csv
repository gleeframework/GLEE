Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was far too generous to yourself.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. The value of the money decreases rapidly for you with each round, so it's in your best interest to accept a reasonable offer now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your attempt at a fair split, the value of the money is dropping fast for me. To counter the inflation, I propose a 40/60 split in my favor. It's a compromise that considers both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000
