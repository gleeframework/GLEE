It's a tough call, but I have to accept Bob's offer.  With only one round left, I'm taking what I can get.  While the inflation has heavily impacted Bob's gains, it's clear he's willing to fight for a larger share.  If I reject, we both get nothing, and the risk of that outcome is too high.  It's better to take 300,000 than nothing at all."
