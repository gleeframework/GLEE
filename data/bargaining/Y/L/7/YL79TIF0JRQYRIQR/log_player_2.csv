# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough situation, but I need to cut my losses.  The value of the deal is rapidly decreasing for me, and Alice seems determined to keep pushing for a larger share. Accepting a 38/62 split is far from ideal, but it's better than risking even further losses from inflation."
