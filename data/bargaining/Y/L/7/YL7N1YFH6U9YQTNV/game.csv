6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. It's a good foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement.,Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the idea of a 50/50 split, the rapidly decreasing value of the money makes it difficult to agree to right now.  Let's see if we can find a more beneficial outcome.",Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The money is losing value fast, especially for you. This offer secures a good portion for me while still giving you something worthwhile.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I believe we can both do better than this offer. Let's split the difference from the previous round and see if we can reach an agreement.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, but the devaluation is working heavily against you. I'm willing to negotiate, but we need to acknowledge the urgency of the situation.",Alice,4,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Bob, this is my final offer.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this falls through. This split ensures a reasonable payout for both of us considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. This split is the best we can do given the circumstances, and ensures we both get something before the money becomes worthless.",Bob,6,
,,"Okay Bob, let's take it. This whole situation is unfortunate, and it's better to secure something now than risk ending up with nothing.",Alice,6,accept
