Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, we both get a good amount""}\n\n###\n\nI made a decision to offer a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to try to end the game relatively quickly while still getting a decent share. I've also included a message to Alice suggesting that this is a fair division, hoping she'll see the reason and accept the offer."
