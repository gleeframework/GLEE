"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering you 400,000$. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a good offer, but I'm not going to accept it. I'll try to do better next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll try to take advantage of this. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm offering you a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer, but still keeping a bit more for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... Bob's offer is actually a 60/40 split, which is more in my favor than my previous offer! And considering the inflation, Bob's gain is actually worth less than mine, so I should take advantage of this.
