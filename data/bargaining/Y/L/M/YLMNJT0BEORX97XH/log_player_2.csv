Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise a bit. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking 55% and you getting 45%. This way we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the further losses from inflation.
