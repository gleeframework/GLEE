"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is still quite skewed in his favor, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I'll aim for a more balanced offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Bob's offer is still slightly biased towards him, but the difference is smaller than before. I'll decide to accept this offer.
