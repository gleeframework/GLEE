"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a large sum of money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's worth holding out for a better deal. With the inflation affecting the money Bob gains less than mine, I think I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a smaller share than his previous offer, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping that with the inflation affecting the money he receives more than mine, he'll see this as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but he's still getting more than me. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, hoping the inflation will make him more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a smaller share than his previous offer, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping that with the inflation affecting the money he receives more than mine, he'll see this as a fair deal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's worth holding out for a better deal. The inflation is hurting me much more than him, and I'm confident I can secure a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With the inflation hitting me much harder, this is the most I can offer while still getting a decent amount. I hope Bob realizes that we're both losing money with each passing round and accepts this offer."
