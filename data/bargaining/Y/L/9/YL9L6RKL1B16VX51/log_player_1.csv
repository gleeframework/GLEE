"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

I'm not thrilled about the 20% gain, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
