"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get some money now rather than risking a worse deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to reject it. I'm not satisfied with the 70/30 split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 63,
  ""bob_gain"": 37,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob! I'm trying to be reasonable, though.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 63/37 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a relatively reasonable offer considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about the 58/42 split, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further erosion of the money's value. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later, and the difference between 58 and 63 isn't that significant.
