"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only $200,000, while Bob gets $800,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable to me, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to gain a larger share. Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, I deserve more""
}

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give in too easily 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a balance between giving me a slightly better deal and keeping a larger share for himself.

I'll reject this offer as well:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only $400,000, while Bob gets $600,000. I think I can do better than that. I'll try to make another counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable to me, I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer to gain a larger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, I'm taking what's mine""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share of $100,000, while I'll take the majority of $900,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only $600,000, while Bob gets $400,000. Considering the inflation, Bob's share is actually worth less than what he was initially offered in the first round, so I think I can do better. I'll try to make another counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable to me, I'll try to make another aggressive offer to gain a larger share. However, I'll also consider the fact that Bob's offer in the previous round was already taking into account the inflation, so I'll make a more moderate offer this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but you have to give me more""
}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in, you're not getting more than this 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting desperate and trying to make a final stand.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept an offer where I get $800,000, even though it's not the largest share I was hoping for. Considering the inflation, Bob's share of $200,000 is actually worth very little, so I think I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to call it a day and end the negotiation."
