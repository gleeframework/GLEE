"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Given the potential inflation, I propose a division where you receive $30. This ensures a stable gain for both of us considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial 100. This offer gives me a decent gain while still being fair to you. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
