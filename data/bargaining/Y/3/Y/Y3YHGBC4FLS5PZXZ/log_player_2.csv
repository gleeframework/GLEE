Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-offer. While her offer seems somewhat fair considering the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your offer was a bit too skewed. How about this slightly adjusted split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on both of us, I've adjusted my offer slightly. This could be the fairest split we can agree on. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but it's still early in the game.  The inflation will hurt me more and more each round, so she's likely to keep pushing for a better deal for herself. Let's see if I can get her to agree to something closer to a 45/55 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me halfway.  This split seems like the fairest considering the time pressure and inflation.""}"
