"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25$ for me, I'll try to do slightly better. I'll offer 30$ to myself and 70$ to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Alice's offer is still a slight majority in her favor, I'll decide to reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, Alice offered me 35$, which is 40% of the original amount. I'll try to increase my share to 50% of the original amount, which is 50$. This way, I'll get a larger share, but it's still a fair offer considering the inflation.
