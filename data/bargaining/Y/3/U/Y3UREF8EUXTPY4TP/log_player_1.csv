"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering you 20$ and keeping 80$ for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money I'd gain, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. I'd rather try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to maximize my gains despite the inflation."
