"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible deal for Bob! There's no reason to accept this offer.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
This offer is a 90/10 split in favor of Bob. It is a fair offer considering the inflation factor will affect Alice more in the future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a significant improvement from Alice's first offer, and it's worth accepting.  While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation rate will make each subsequent round less advantageous for me.  It's better to take what I can get now."
