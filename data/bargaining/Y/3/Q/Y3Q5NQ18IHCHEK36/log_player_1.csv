"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll get the remaining $900,000. It's a pretty generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation!"
