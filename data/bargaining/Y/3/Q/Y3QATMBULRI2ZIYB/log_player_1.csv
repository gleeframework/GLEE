"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $40 and take $60. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my share has decreased due to inflation!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30-70 split. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, my gain is now worth even less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll take $45 and you can have $55. Let's make a deal?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting greedy, I want more. You can have a small share, but I'm taking the majority. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20-80 split, especially when my share is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly, but I'll try to make the most of it. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain is now worth a tiny fraction of the original amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 12,
  ""bob_gain"": 88,
  ""message"": ""I'll take what I can get. I'll take $12 and you can have $88. It's a small consolation prize, but it's better than nothing.""
}
```

I'm trying to accept the harsh reality of inflation and make the best of a bad situation!"
