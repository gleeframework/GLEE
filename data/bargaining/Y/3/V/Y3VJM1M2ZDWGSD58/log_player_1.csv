"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by proposing a 90/10 split, keeping the majority of the money for myself. It's a fairly aggressive offer, but I want to see how Bob reacts to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have liked to get more, accepting a 50/50 split is a good outcome considering the inflation.  It's better than risking a lower offer in the next round."
