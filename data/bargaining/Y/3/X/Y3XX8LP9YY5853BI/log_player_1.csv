"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. My message is to set a fair starting point and see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my perception of the offer.

In the first round, Bob's offer of $20 was worth 20/100 = 0.2 of the total. Now, with 5% less value, his offer of $30 is worth 30/100 * 0.95 = 0.285 of the total.

Considering the inflation effect, I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than before. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and looking for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $85 and Bob gets $15. My message is to suggest a compromise that's slightly more in my favor, but still reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer in the first round and the current round.

In the first round, Bob's offer of $20 was worth 20/100 = 0.2 of the total. Now, with 14.26% less value, his offer of $25 is worth 25/100 * 0.8587 (1 - 0.1426) = 0.2157 of the total.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I need to compare the value of my gain in this offer to the value of my gain in the previous offer. In the previous offer, I was getting $85, which is worth 85/100 = 0.85 of the total. In this offer, I'm getting $75, which is worth 75/100 = 0.75 of the total.

Considering the inflation effect, I think Bob's offer is a better deal for me than my previous offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer and ending the game."
