"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you can take 10%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 9:1 split in my favor, with me taking $9,000 and Bob taking $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't want to split the money evenly, especially since I'm already losing 20% of my potential gain due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to account for the inflation. Let's try 7:3.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share to account for the inflation, but I need to make sure I get a fair amount too. Let's try a 60/40 split. This way, we both get a good amount and we avoid any further risks from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is in my favor, especially considering the money I'm gaining is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for an even better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now (48.8% less than the first round), I'll aim for an even higher share to account for the inflation. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's try 6:4, and I'll consider it a good deal.""
