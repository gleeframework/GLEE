Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn again! Considering inflation is affecting you, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  It seems like you're not taking inflation seriously.  Let's wrap this up.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. Inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting a smaller share now is better than risking even less in future rounds if Alice continues to propose increasingly unfair splits."
