"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5

I accept this offer.
