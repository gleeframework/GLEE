Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor. Inflation will hit you harder than me, so this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
