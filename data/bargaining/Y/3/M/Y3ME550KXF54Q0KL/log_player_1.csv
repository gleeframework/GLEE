"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation affecting me.

However, Bob's gain is significantly higher than mine, and I'm not sure if I want to settle for less than I proposed initially. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 300,000 for me and 700,000 for him, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain more significantly, his offer is now even less attractive to me. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not inclined to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer, considering that Bob's gain is decreasing in value due to inflation. Here's my proposal for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's gain decreasing in value at an alarming rate, I'll think carefully about this offer. My gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is now significantly lower than his previous offers.

Considering the rapid inflation, I'll take a risk and accept this offer. It's better to get something now than to risk getting nothing if we reach the 12th round.
