"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 55/45.  It's a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, as it reflects my willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise on a 50/50 split.  It's a fair and even division, and we can both walk away with a decent share of the money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting late in the game and the inflation is starting to hurt. A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise."
