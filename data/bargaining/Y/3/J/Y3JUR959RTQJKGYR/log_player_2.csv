"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money this round, but I'm willing to be more generous in the future if you accept. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer might seem somewhat reasonable at first glance, it's important to consider the long game and the impact of inflation. Accepting $10 now means losing a significant portion of the potential earnings. It's worth seeing if Alice will offer a more equitable split in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this offer is much fairer in the long run. Think about the future!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference from last round.  This is a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to anchor the negotiations around her initial offer.  While a 40/60 split is better than the first offer, it's still not in Bob's best interest. With inflation eating into his potential gains each round, Bob needs to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This offer is a compromise that accounts for the time pressure. Let's settle this fairly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally agreeing to a fair split. While Bob might have been able to negotiate for a slightly larger share earlier, accepting now guarantees him a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing if the game goes to the final round."
