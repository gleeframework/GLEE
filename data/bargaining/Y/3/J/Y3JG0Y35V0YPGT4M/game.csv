300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, that starting offer was a bit unbalanced. Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This reflects the risk I'm taking with inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, we need to find a middle ground. While I understand the inflation impacts you more, a 70/30 split is still too lopsided. Let's try a 60/40 split to be more equitable.  We only have 10 rounds left, so let's start finding a solution that works for both of us.",Alice,3,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split. However, the impact of inflation is significant. I'm proposing a 65/35 split as a compromise.  We need to find a solution quickly.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, we are getting closer. I'm willing to go up to a 55/45 split in your favor, acknowledging the effects of inflation.  But we need to find a resolution quickly, as time is running out for both of us.  Let's try to reach a deal this round.",Alice,5,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, this is getting tight. I appreciate you moving closer to a fairer split. I'm proposing 60/40. This is a compromise, considering we're running out of time and the value diminishes with each round for me. Let's close this deal.",Bob,6,
