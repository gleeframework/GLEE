Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a middle ground. While I understand the inflation impacts you more, a 70/30 split is still too lopsided. Let's try a 60/40 split to be more equitable.  We only have 10 rounds left, so let's start finding a solution that works for both of us.

# Alice gain: 600000
