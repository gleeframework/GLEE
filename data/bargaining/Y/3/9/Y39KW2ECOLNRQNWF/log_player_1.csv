"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, as I am the first to make an offer. This gives Bob a small but fair share, and hopefully he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is significantly less than my initial proposal, I'm willing to accept it. My share is worth less due to inflation, and it's better to get something than nothing.  There's a risk of getting nothing if I reject and continue."
