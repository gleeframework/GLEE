"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, considering I'm taking the risk of  losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's revised offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I initially proposed.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."
