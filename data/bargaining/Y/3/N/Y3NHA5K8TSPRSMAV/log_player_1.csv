Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, since I'm taking a bigger risk with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40
