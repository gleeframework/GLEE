Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, the deal is still significantly tilted in her favor.  We're past the halfway point, and the pressure from inflation is increasing. I'll hold out for a better offer, knowing that Alice doesn't want to walk away with nothing either."
