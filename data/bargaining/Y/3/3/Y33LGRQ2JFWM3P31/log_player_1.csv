"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both do better than this in future rounds""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to find a good solution. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $400,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up that much to inflation. Can you offer a better deal?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer to account for the potential for further inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to account for the inflation, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Let's see if we can do better.""
}
