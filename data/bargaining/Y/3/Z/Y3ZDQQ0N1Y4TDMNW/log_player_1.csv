"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, no need to overthink it! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best I can get. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal, Bob. I'm being generous.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect too much! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if a 60/40 split is the best I can get. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
