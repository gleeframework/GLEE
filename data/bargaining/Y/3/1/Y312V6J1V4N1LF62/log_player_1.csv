"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1. You get 1/5, I get 4/5. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 4/5 of the money and Bob getting 1/5. This way, we both get a significant amount, but I'm positioning myself for a stronger negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a slightly more balanced split. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess my decision. With the new offer, I'd be getting 700,000, which is worth 560,000 in the original value (due to 20% less). That's not bad, but I was hoping for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's split the money 3:2. I'll take a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and leaving room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to compromise. This split is a bit more in my favor, but I think it's still a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd be getting 550,000, which is worth 440,000 in the original value (due to 48.8% less). That's a decent amount, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the money 50/50. I'm willing to give up some of my advantage to get a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, where we both get an equal share of the remaining money. This way, I'm hoping to increase the chances of getting a decent amount in the end."
