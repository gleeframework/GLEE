Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than 40%. Let's split the difference and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for Bob with each round. Accepting $450,000 now is better than risking getting an even lower amount later.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, moving from a 99/1 split to a 55/45 split. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means Bob risks getting a worse deal in Round 4. The potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the guaranteed loss from inflation. 

Therefore, accepting the current offer ensures Bob a reasonable share, even if it's less than what he initially aimed for.
