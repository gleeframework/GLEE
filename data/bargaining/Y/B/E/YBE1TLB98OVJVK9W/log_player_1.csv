Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor, aiming for a fair but slightly advantageous deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred my initial offer, the 10% inflation makes a 50/50 split a reasonable compromise.  It's better to secure $5000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
