"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm trying to be generous, but not too generous, to entice Bob to accept the offer. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is meant to convey a sense of fairness and encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game early, rather than risking further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. My offer is more fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less now due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob, he may be more willing to compromise in the next round to avoid losing even more value. Additionally, accepting $400,000 now would be worth less than what I initially offered Bob, so I want to try to get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $420,000 and keep $580,000 for myself. This is a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, taking into account the devaluation of the money due to inflation. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob will be willing to accept, considering that the money is now worth 10% less to him than in the initial round. My message to Bob is ""Meet me halfway,"" indicating that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution.\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway""}\n\n###"
