60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I get $60, and you get $40. This way we both win something and don't risk losing everything to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I think your offer was a bit biased. How about we split it 55-45? That way we both get a decent share and I feel more comfortable with the division.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Hi Bob, let's try to find a compromise. I understand you want a larger share, but remember that the value decreases for you with each round. I propose $58 for me and $42 for you. It's a better deal than you'll get in later rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think I can get a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'll try to meet you halfway. How about 52-48? It's a fairer split, and we can both walk away with something.",Bob,4,

57.0,43.0,"Bob, we're getting close to the point where this is hurting you more than it helps.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $57 for me and $43 for you, but I can't go any lower.  Let's close this out and both get something.",Alice,5,
