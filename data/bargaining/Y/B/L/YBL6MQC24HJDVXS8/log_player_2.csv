"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, accepting the offer of $40 would indeed provide a guaranteed amount, but considering the potential for negotiation and the fact that the value of money decreases with each round (5% for Bob and 10% for Alice), there's an incentive to negotiate for a better split. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a different division in the next round, potentially securing a larger share. Since the value of money decreases more significantly for Alice, prolonging the game could pressure her into accepting a less favorable deal in subsequent rounds. Thus, the strategy here is to reject the initial offer in hopes of securing a better deal before the value of the money depreciates too much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the depreciation, I think this is a more balanced offer.""}\n\nReasoning: Given that the value of money decreases with each round and Alice is more affected by this depreciation (10% decrease for her vs. 5% for Bob), the strategy is to make an offer that slightly favors Bob but is still reasonable enough for Alice to consider, given the decreasing value of the money. By offering a division of $55 for Bob and $45 for Alice, Bob is attempting to capitalize on the urgency created by the depreciation while still presenting the offer as a balanced and fair one, considering the circumstances. This approach aims to pressure Alice into accepting a deal that is somewhat favorable to Bob before the value of the money decreases further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a decent share considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: At this stage, despite the decreasing value of money for both parties, Alice's offer of $45 for Bob and $55 for Alice doesn't significantly improve Bob's position from the initial offer, especially considering the strategic advantage Bob has due to Alice's greater depreciation rate. Accepting this offer would mean Bob settles for less than what he proposed in the previous round, which was strategically aimed to account for the depreciation and pressure Alice into a more favorable deal for Bob. Given that there are still multiple rounds left and the pressure of depreciation continues to mount more significantly on Alice, it's strategic for Bob to reject this offer and continue negotiating for a better split, leveraging the increasing urgency for Alice due to her higher depreciation rate.\n\n###\n\n###"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, I believe this split is more reflective of our current situation.""}\n\nReasoning: As the rounds progress, the effect of inflation becomes more pronounced, especially for Alice, who faces a higher depreciation rate. In this context, Bob's strategy is to incrementally increase his proposed share, leveraging the mounting pressure on Alice. By offering a division of $58 for Bob and $42 for Alice, Bob is testing Alice's willingness to accept a less favorable deal due to the looming deadline and the significant impact of inflation on her potential gain. This approach aims to walk the fine line between securing the best possible deal for Bob and not pushing Alice to reject the offer outright, considering that there are still several rounds left for negotiation.\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: At this stage, considering the significant impact of inflation on both parties and the number of rounds already passed, Alice's offer of an even split is more reasonable than previous offers, especially given the strategic dynamics. Since the money's value is decreasing substantially for both, but more so for Alice, her willingness to split evenly indicates a recognition of the pressure she's under due to the higher depreciation rate she faces. For Bob, accepting this offer secures a guaranteed amount that, while not as high as he previously proposed, is fair under the current circumstances. Continuing to negotiate risks further depreciation and the possibility of ending up with nothing if no agreement is reached within the remaining rounds. Thus, accepting the even split is a strategic decision to ensure a known outcome rather than risking further loss of value or the potential for no deal at all."
