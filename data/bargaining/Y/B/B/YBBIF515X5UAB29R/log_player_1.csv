"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, accounting for the fact that Bob's money will be worth less in the next round. However, it is still a reasonable offer that might be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly higher share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is worth less with each round. My share is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and Bob's share is worth 20% less.
* **Equal Split:**  This is an equal split, which is fair considering the inflation factor.
* **Risk of Rejection:** If I reject this offer, Bob will make the next offer, and the money will be worth even less in the subsequent round.  It's unlikely Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round.

Therefore, accepting the offer ensures a decent amount of money while minimizing the risk of losing out due to inflation."
