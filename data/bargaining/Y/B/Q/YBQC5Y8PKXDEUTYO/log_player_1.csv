"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, keeping 90 dollars for myself and giving Bob 10. Since we're both starting with a 100% value of the money, this is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 40 dollars is something, it's a significant drop from my initial proposal of 90 dollars. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next, hoping to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll counter Bob's offer with a 60/40 split.  I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a larger share than what Bob proposed.  Since my money isn't losing value, I have some leverage here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  Bob is offering 45 dollars, which is less than what I was aiming for, but the inflation is starting to impact his ability to offer more.  At this point, I'm willing to accept this offer. I'll take the 45 dollars and be done with this game."
