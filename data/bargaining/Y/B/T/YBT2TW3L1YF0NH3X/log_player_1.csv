"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."

# Alice gain: 4000

Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Since the offer is now:
Alice gain: 4000 (worth 80% of 8000)
