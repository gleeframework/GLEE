6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Your split is reasonable, but it benefits you more in the long run. Let's make it a bit more even.",Bob,2,
,,"Your offer seems fairer at first glance, but the inflation affects you more than me. Let's try to find a more mutually beneficial agreement.",Alice,2,reject
5700.0,4300.0,I understand your concern about the long run. How about 5700 for me and 4300 for you? This factors in the inflation a bit more.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5400.0,4600.0,This offer is a compromise considering the inflation. It's getting risky to keep declining!,Bob,4,
,,"Okay, that seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances. I accept.",Alice,4,accept
