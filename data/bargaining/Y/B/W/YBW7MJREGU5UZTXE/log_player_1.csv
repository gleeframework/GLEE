"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This reflects the risk of inflation while still being a fair compromise. Let's end this round and avoid further potential losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
