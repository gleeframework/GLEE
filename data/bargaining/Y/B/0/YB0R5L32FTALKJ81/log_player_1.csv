"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of the original value, so $80 is now worth $72.

Considering Bob's offer, I see that he's suggesting a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
