"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll receive $4,000, which is worth 90% of the original $4,000 I proposed in the first round. That's a decent compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
