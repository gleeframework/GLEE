Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 7:3 split is fairer, considering the value loss for Alice. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
