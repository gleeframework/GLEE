"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate more!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I'm starting with a fair split to see if Bob will accept or counteroffer."
