"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm taking into account the inflation risk, but I think a 55/45 split is reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
