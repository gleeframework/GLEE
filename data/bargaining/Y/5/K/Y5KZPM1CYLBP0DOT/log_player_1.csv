**Reasoning:**

While this is the same offer Bob made in Round 1, the value of the money has decreased significantly for both of us due to inflation. 

* **My perspective:** Accepting 600,000 now is better than risking another round where I might get even less.
* **Bob's perspective:**  The longer this goes on, the less his share is worth. He's likely feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely.

It's in my best interest to take this offer now before inflation erodes the value further."
