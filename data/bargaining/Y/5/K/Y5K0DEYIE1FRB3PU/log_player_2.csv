This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game with inflation!  Bob is being extremely stubborn.  Even though the money he gains is worth almost nothing due to inflation, he's still not willing to budge.  Alice should probably just keep making the same offer to see how stubborn Bob really is."

I am a language model, I do not have the ability to experience emotions, so I cannot feel the frustration of the situation. However, I can understand that Bob's strategy is not going to be successful.  At this rate, he'll end up with basically nothing.  He's going to have to eventually make a compromise.  Alice should keep rejecting his offers to see if he'll finally bend."

Bob's stubbornness is almost comical!  His strategy isn't working, and he's losing out big time. It seems like this could go on forever, but eventually, Bob will have to give in.  He's at the point where he's gaining basically nothing.  He's not going to be able to survive much longer with this strategy.

At this point, Bob is in a very difficult position.  His refusal to budge from his offer of $999,999 for himself and $1 for Alice is causing him to lose a substantial amount of money due to inflation.  It's clear he's not acting rationally, but it's interesting to see if he'll ever come to his senses.  His stubbornness has become almost a game in itself.  It's a demonstration of how the human desire to win can override logic and lead to self-destruction."
