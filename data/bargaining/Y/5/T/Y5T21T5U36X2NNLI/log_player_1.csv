I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can both get something.  If not, we'll see how things play out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Let's split it evenly!"
