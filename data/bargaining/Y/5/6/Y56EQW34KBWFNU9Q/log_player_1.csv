Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your split was unfair. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. This accounts for me making a more reasonable offer in the next round if you reject.

# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
