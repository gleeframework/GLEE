"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, which is a relatively fair share considering I have no information about Bob's preferences."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give it all away just yet. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, the effective amount I'd gain from Bob's offer is:

$700,000 * 0.95 = $665,000

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer yet. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal in future rounds. I'll reject the offer for now.

}
```
