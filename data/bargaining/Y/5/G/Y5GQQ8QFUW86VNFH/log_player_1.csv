"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, my initial offer would have been 70 dollars, but I rejected it. Now, Bob is offering 50 dollars, which is more than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll offer a bit more to Bob this time. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now. Considering my initial offer would have been around 80 dollars, and now I'm being offered 40 dollars, I think I should accept this offer.
