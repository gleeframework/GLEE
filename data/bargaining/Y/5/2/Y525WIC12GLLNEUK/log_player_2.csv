"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, remember the inflation! You're losing 10% of your share each round. It's better to reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly.  We both get the same amount, and we can avoid any more rounds and the risk of inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the inflation.  Even though the offer is slightly better than the first round, it's still a significant loss for me, and I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm also worried about losing more money to inflation.  Let's split it closer to even, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}
