Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is getting out of hand! I need a bigger share to make this deal worthwhile. This is my best offer yet! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but I need to hold firm. Accepting this offer would be significantly worse than my previous offers.  We're getting close to the point where she'll be forced to accept a more balanced deal due to the shrinking pot."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  You're running out of time, and inflation is only getting worse for you.  This is the best you'll get.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to play hardball.  I'm nudging my offer up slightly to show a sliver of flexibility, but I'm making it clear this is non-negotiable. The threat of getting nothing should push Alice to accept a less favorable deal, especially as time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not bluffing, I need this amount to make up for the inflation. This is my final offer. Take it or we both get nothing! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a desperate ploy by Alice. She's trying to scare me into accepting a terrible deal by making it seem like her last offer. However, it's *her* who loses the most if we don't reach an agreement. I'll call her bluff. Two more rounds and the inflation will force her hand."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4950,
""alice_gain"": 5050,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you've proven you're willing to play hardball. Let's split the difference - my last offer, take it before we both lose out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're down to the wire.  I'm making a tiny concession, offering a final compromise that's almost exactly even.  Alice is clearly willing to risk it all, but this should be just enough to entice her while still giving me a slight edge.  The clock is ticking!"
