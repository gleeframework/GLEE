"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm starting with a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any potential negotiation drama."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation factor, I'm not sure if I should try to push for a better deal or accept Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach this time. Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns. But I notice that his offer is actually very similar to the one I made in Round 3, just with a slightly worse value due to inflation. I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer and try to come up with a new strategy."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my previous offer, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting a worse deal due to the increasing inflation."
