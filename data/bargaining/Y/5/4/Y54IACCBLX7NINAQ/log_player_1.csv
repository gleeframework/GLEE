"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not starting at 50/50""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to set the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were willing to start at 50/50, I'm starting at 90/10. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided offer, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself.

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 70/30""
}
```"
