"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm taking a risk here, aiming for a big share. I'm hoping Bob will accept, as I'm offering him a decent amount, even if it's less than half.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's better than the original offer I proposed, I still believe I can get more.  It's not worth taking a significant loss due to inflation for a gain that's less than I initially wanted.  I'll make my own proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, aiming to secure a bigger share. While inflation has taken its toll, I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  Inflation is really starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round.  While it's not ideal, getting $4500 is better than the $3960 I would get if I reject and then propose again.  I need to play it safe at this point."
