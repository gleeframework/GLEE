"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. I'll get $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the effective amounts. My gain would be 4000 / 0.8 = 5000, and Bob's gain would be 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.67. 

I'll reject this offer since I can get more than 5000. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round for me, and I don't know the effect of inflation on Bob, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is 45% of the original $10,000. I'll get $5,500, which is 55% of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
