"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split. I figure I'll take the lion's share, but it's still a decent offer to start with. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be ready for his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me, even with the inflation,  I can still get a better deal if we continue negotiating.  I'll reject and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway. I'll offer 8500/1500, taking into account the inflation on my side and the fact that Bob is also facing a loss in value.  I think this is a fair compromise and a good chance for us both to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, considering the significant inflation affecting him, it's still not a fair deal. I'll reject it and see if he's willing to budge more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'll try to make a compromise again, offering 8000/2000.  The inflation is hitting us both hard, but I think this is a realistic split that gives us both something, especially given the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. The inflation is really biting, and I need to secure something before the money becomes worthless. Even though it's a smaller share than I'd hoped for,  it's better than getting nothing."
