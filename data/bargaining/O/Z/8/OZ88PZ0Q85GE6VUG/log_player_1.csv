I'm starting with a generous offer, aiming to secure the deal quickly.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial proposal. I'll reject and see what he offers in the next round. I'm hoping he'll realize that he needs to be more generous to get a deal done."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm lowering my demand slightly to try and reach an agreement, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money. Bob needs to start compromising if he wants to get anything at all."
