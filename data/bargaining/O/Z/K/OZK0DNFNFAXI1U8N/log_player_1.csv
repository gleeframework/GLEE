"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. I'll take 70% and you take 30%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which seems fair to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer a more generous split, but I think 60% is still a fair share for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is still taking a larger share than I am. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to make a counteroffer. How about 55% for me and 45% for you?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. My gain of $400,000 is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about 42% for me and 58% for you?""
}
```"
