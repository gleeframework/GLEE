"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can do better than this, but it's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair starting point and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to start with a slightly more even split. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4500 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $4275.

I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I think it's a good opportunity to move forward. I'd rather accept this offer than continue negotiating.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
