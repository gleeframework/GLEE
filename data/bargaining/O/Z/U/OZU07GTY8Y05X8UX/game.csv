100000.0,900000.0,I think we should aim for a more even split. Let's go with 90/10 in my favor this time.  We can still work towards a more equitable outcome in the future.,Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 90/10 is too much. Let's split the difference and go with 55/45 in your favor. This way we can both get a decent share, and we still have room to negotiate if we want to adjust it further down the line.",Alice,3,
