Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should aim for a more even split. Let's go with 90/10 in my favor this time.  We can still work towards a more equitable outcome in the future. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
