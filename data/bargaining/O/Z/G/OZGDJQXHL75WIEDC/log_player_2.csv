"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. It's fair given the inflation, and we can both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me.  Alice is losing value at a slower rate than I am. Holding out for a slightly better deal in the next few rounds is worth the risk, as the difference in inflation will put more pressure on Alice to make a deal."

""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I see we need to find a middle ground. How about a 53/47 split? It's a small increase for me from your last offer, but fair considering the money loses value faster on my side.""
