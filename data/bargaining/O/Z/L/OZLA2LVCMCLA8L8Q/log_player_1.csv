"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's end the game""}

I'm proposing a 70:30 split, where I take 700,000 and Bob takes 300,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'd like to end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60:40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob is offering a slightly better deal than my initial proposal, I'll accept his offer.
