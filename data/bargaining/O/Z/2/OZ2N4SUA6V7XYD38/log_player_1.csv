"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```
This is a 3:1 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in round 1 was 3:1, and Bob's offer in round 2 is 2.13:1. I'll accept Bob's offer to get a better deal.
