"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I can compare the values directly.

I'll reject Bob's offer because I'd rather have 500,000 (which is worth the same as in the first round) than 400,000 (which is worth more than 500,000 in the first round).

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor. I'll offer a 55/45 split.

```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the value of Bob's offer, I need to consider the inflation effect on Bob's gain. Since Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round.

Bob's gain in the first round would be worth 700,000 / 0.8584 (1 - 0.1426) = 814,111.

Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the values. I'd rather have 500,000 (which is worth the same as in the first round) than 814,111 (which is worth more than 500,000 in the first round).

I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30 in his favor, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor even more. I'll offer a 60/40 split.

Bob's gain in the first round would be worth 800,000 / 0.7778 (1 - 0.2262) = 1,030,769.
