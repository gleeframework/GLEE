"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, hoping to get a good response and set a good tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly this time. It's a better deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amount I would gain from Bob's offer is 50 * 0.8 = 40.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I can get more than that in future rounds, and I want to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, the actual amount I'm working with is 40% of the original 80 I would have received in Round 1, which is 16.

I'll make a new offer, hoping to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but let's not waste any more rounds.  We're both losing money with each passing turn! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll! The money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I would gain from Bob's offer is 40 * 0.516 (1 - 0.488) = 20.64.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I can get more than that in future rounds, and I still think I can negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I'm working with is 16 * 0.516 = 8.264.

I'll make a new offer, trying to be more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob! I need a better deal now!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time!  I'm willing to give you 30, but I think it's in your best interest to accept this offer before we both lose out on more money! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll! The money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I would gain from Bob's offer is 30 * 0.331 (1 - 0.669) = 9.93.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I think I can get more than that in future rounds, and I'm not convinced that this is the best deal for me.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I'm working with is 8.264 * 0.331 = 2.74.

I'll make a new offer, trying to be more aggressive given the low value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get away with this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're almost out of time!  It's clear we're both stubborn, but I think this is the only offer we can both agree on to get something. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really ravaging the value of the money! The money is worth 79.03% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I would gain from Bob's offer is 20 * 0.205 (1 - 0.795) = 4.1.

Considering the low value of the money and the limited time left, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
