"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a bit more fair.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a 60-40 split, which is the same as my initial offer, but in reverse.

Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value. In this case, I'll gain 320,000 and Bob will gain 480,000.

I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 48-52 split? It's a fair deal, and we can move forward.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
