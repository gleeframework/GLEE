Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Hurts:**  I'm losing money rapidly with each round. A 34.39% decrease is very significant.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer me anything better, and it's highly likely any future offer will be worse due to the accelerating inflation for me.
* **Something is better than nothing:** While not ideal, 430,000 is still a significant sum of money. 

It's frustrating to settle, but waiting longer will only hurt my position."
