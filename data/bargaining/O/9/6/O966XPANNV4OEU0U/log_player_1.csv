"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then adjust in future rounds""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can reassess and adjust in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with an even split, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth 20% less this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. I'll have to be more cautious and consider the long-term implications.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd rather not give up 60% of the remaining amount so early in the game.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up control just yet""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this round, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up control? I'm taking control now. You'll get a small consolation prize. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, it looks like Bob is getting more aggressive!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by 48.8% since the first round, I'm not sure I want to give up even more control. $2000 is a small consolation prize, but I'm not sure it's enough to justify giving up most of the remaining amount.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up entirely. Let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
