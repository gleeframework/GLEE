"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this reasonable offer and let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a further 5% bite, my potential gain is worth even less. I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle and we can end this! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now. The value of my gain is decreasing rapidly.

Considering the current state of the game, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable one. Meeting in the middle seems like a good idea, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
