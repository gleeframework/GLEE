"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly considering the inflation""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering the inflation that affects my share. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's fair given the circumstances. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is affecting you more, but my offer in the next round would have to be significantly lower. This is a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, a 30-70 split seems too skewed in his favor, especially considering my initial offer was more balanced. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, this is the most balanced offer I can make""}\n\nGiven the inflation's growing effect on my share, I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split. This is as fair as it gets under the current circumstances. I hope Bob understands the compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
