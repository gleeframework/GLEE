"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to reassess the value of Bob's offer.

Since the money is now worth less, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
