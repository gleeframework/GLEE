"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than before, but I'm not going to give up half the money.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, I still believe I have leverage given the time pressure and inflation. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount compared to my initial ask."
