"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. I'm also trying to set a positive tone with my message to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that we both have an equal chance to propose in the future. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my perception of the offer.

In the first round, I was offered $4,000, which was 40% of the total. Now, in the second round, Bob is offering $5,500, which is 55% of the total. Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust the value of $5,500 to account for the 10% decrease in value.

$5,500 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to adjust the percentage accordingly. I'll consider $5,500 as equivalent to $6,111.11 in the first round.

With this adjustment, the offer is now 55% of the original $10,000, which is actually a more favorable split for me than the original 60-40 split I proposed. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one.

For now, I'll reject the offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation effect and the fact that Bob's offer was a 55-45 split, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the money 50-50. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more equal division of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
