"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob to encourage fairness. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob seems like a good deal now, it's important to remember the inflation.  Accepting the offer means the game ends immediately, preventing further loss of value for Bob's portion of the money."
