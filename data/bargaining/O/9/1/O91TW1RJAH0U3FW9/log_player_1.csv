"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 2:1 ratio, where I receive $4000 and you receive $6000. This is a fair compromise considering the initial offer was not acceptable. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
