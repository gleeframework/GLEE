"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and you'll take 40%. This is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
