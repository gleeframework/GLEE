"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split it 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I'll gain in this round are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
* Bob's gain: 5000 (no change)

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
