Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit more, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly increasing her offer, clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. It's still better to hold out and hope she offers a more significant increase, especially as we approach the halfway point of the rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, acknowledging your larger share while still being reasonable for me given the time pressure.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to show some flexibility. By offering a slight increase from the even split, I acknowledge Alice's preference for a larger share. However, the offer still favors me considering the time pressure and the increasing impact of inflation. This might be enough to entice her while still securing a decent portion for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give in a bit more, but I think this is the fairest split considering the situation 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. The inflation is really hurting, and my potential gains are shrinking rapidly. Alice's offer is still far from ideal, but it's better than her previous ones. 

Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point. If I reject this, there's a real risk she'll offer even less in the next round, pushing me to accept a worse deal later. 
* **Slow Progress:** Her offer increments are tiny, suggesting she's trying to squeeze every dollar. Accepting now might be better than enduring several more rounds of minimal increases.

It's not a great offer, but the risk of getting a much worse outcome outweighs the potential for a slightly better one at this stage."
