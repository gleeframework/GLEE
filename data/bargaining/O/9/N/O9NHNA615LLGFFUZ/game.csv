5800.0,4200.0,"I understand your point of view, Bob. Let's find a compromise. How about a 58/42 split in my favor? It's slightly better for me than your offer, but still a decent deal for both of us considering the time pressure.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Time is running out, Alice. I'm offering a 52/48 split. It's a small edge for me, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing everything. My offer is 55/45 - it's a good compromise considering the time pressure and the fact that I'm the one losing value with each round.",Alice,5,
