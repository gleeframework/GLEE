Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

This offer is getting worse for me with the inflation! I need to turn things around in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more, and this offer still gives you a decent share.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your end, I believe this split is more suitable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

This is a tough one! While not ideal, accepting ensures I at least get something. Rejecting and hoping for a better deal in Round 5 is too risky with the accelerating inflation."
