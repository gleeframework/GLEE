7000.0,3000.0,I propose we divide the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This allows both of us to share a fair portion while accounting for the decreasing value of money over rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the value of money is decreasing at different rates for us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Considering the inflation rates and the decreasing value of money, I propose a 52.5/47.5 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while reflecting the diminishing worth of our currency.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not willing to give up more than that, considering the inflation rates.",Bob,4,
