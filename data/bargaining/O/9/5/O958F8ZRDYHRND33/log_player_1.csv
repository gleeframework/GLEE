"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time for a more balanced split. Let's try this! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the further decrease in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for Bob, hoping he'll accept this time."
