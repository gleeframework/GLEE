"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and efficient, Bob. I propose a 52.5/47.5 split to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's not a terrible deal, I want to see if I can get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking a slightly larger share.  It's a fair deal, considering we're both losing money with every round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money - literally. I'm coming down to 50.25/49.75. Let's seal the deal before inflation eats further into our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 497500 
# Alice gain: 502500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still think I could get a slightly better split, the inflation is making this a riskier game. Accepting Alice's offer is the safest way to ensure I get a decent share of the money."
