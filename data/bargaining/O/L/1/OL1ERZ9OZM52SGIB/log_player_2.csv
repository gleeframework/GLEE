Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation eats up more of our potential gains.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, Bob, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the gap is closing, it's still in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal at this point.  Take it before inflation hurts us both even more.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Alice is consistently offering slightly more each round, banking on my fear of inflation. Offering a 50/50 split shows her I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair deal, even with the inflation working against me. This is a strong psychological play that might finally get her to agree."
