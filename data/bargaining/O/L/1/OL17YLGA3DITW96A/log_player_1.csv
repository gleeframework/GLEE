"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script - I propose a split that's fair for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better deal, considering I'm the one who made the initial proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 40-60 split, I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split considering the initial offer I made""}"
