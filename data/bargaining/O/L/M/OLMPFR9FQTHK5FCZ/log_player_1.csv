"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it down the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I'll have to accept it since it's a fair split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $5,000 and Bob will take $5,000. Let's end the game!"
