"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more fair reflection of the value we're each getting from this deal. Since I'm taking on the risk of the decreasing value, I believe it's reasonable to get a slightly larger share. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
