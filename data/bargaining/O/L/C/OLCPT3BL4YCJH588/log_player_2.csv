Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on the value decrease, but I'm not willing to accept such a large difference in our shares. Let's meet in the middle with a 50/50 split. It's a fair and quick resolution. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
