"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation!""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that the money loses value for Bob with each passing round. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can conclude the game. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation will affect my share in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel pressured to accept a worse offer than I initially proposed. I initially offered Bob 40, and now he's offering me the same amount. Considering the inflation doesn't affect me, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than it seems!""}\n\nSince Bob's share is worth 10% less with each passing round, I'm hoping he'll consider my offer more favorably this time around. I've increased my share to 65, but emphasized in the message that the inflation makes the deal more generous than it initially appears. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
