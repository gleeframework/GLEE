"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of the original value, so I'm looking at a gain of 8000 x 0.8 = 6400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be gaining 5000, which is worth 80% of 6250, since it's the amount Bob would have gained in the first round, and it's worth 80% of that now.

I think this is a reasonable offer, and meeting in the middle seems like a good compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
