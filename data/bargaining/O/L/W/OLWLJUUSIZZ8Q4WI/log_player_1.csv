"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a highly unfair proposal, but it sets a clear precedent that I am willing to be aggressive.  I expect Bob to reject this offer and counter-propose in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and avoid risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
