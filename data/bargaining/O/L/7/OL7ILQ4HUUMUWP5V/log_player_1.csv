"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 5000 is now worth 90% of the original value, which is $4500. Bob's gain of 5000 is now worth 95% of the original value, which is $4750.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation adjustment. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to maximize my gain while minimizing Bob's. Since the money is worth 10% less than the previous round, I'll aim to take a larger share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual values, I'll consider the inflation adjustments. My gain of 4500 is worth 72.9% of the original value, which is $7290. Bob's gain of 5500 is worth 85.74% of the original value, which is $8577.

Considering the inflation adjustment, this offer seems reasonable. I'll accept it.
