"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'd better accept a higher percentage of the remaining money.

I accept Bob's offer.
