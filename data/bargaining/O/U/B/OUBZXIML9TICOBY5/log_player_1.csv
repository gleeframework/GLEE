"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we both get $5,000 each. This is a fair and simple starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the offer, I'll think for a moment... 

I'm not thrilled about giving up $1,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being worth even less due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
