Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  This offer is closer to your previous proposal, but still gives me a decent share.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us before things get even more inflated. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is taking advantage of my larger inflation rate. While her offer is closer to my proposal, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the money will be worth significantly less for me if we go another round. I need to push for a more equitable split while I still have some leverage."
