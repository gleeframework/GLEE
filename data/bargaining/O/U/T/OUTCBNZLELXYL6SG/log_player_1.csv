"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how the game goes!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a 50/50 split, I'm taking a bit more this round. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""You took 80 last round, I'm taking 30 this time. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount for myself!"
