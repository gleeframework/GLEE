"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but your last offer was too far off. This is a fair split that considers both our interests and the value of time. Let's finish this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid inflation working against me. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair deal and am willing to push further into the rounds where my negotiating position strengthens due to the accelerating devaluation of her share."
