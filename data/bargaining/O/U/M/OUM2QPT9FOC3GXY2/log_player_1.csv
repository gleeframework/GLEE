  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less.

I'll think about it...

```

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so it's now worth a relatively small amount.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation, I think $3500 is a decent amount for me, and it's better than risking getting nothing if we go to the next round."
