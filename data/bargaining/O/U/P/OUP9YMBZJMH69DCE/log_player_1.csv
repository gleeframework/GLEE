"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose Alice gets $9000 and Bob gets $1000.  This is a fair starting point, and it gives Bob some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a much more even split, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see what Bob offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly more generous deal for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept before the inflation impacts us too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more greedy, but I still believe I can do better. I'll reject again and see if he's willing to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount to Bob, hoping he'll realize that further rejection will only decrease his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being unreasonable, and I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm lowering my offer again, but still giving Bob a decent share. The inflation is starting to hurt both of us, so hopefully he'll realize it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous. Bob is being incredibly greedy, but I'm not going to cave in. We're nearing the end of the game, and I'm confident I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're getting close to the end of the game, and the inflation is really starting to bite. I'm offering an even split, which is a fair compromise given the circumstances. Hopefully, Bob will finally see reason and accept."
