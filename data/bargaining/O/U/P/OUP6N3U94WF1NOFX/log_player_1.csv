"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $6,000 and $4,000 respectively. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation we need to account for. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I understand Bob's concern about inflation. Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than my initial proposal.
