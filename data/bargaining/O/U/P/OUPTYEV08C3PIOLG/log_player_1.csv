Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, Alice. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I'm proposing a slight adjustment for a win-win situation. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. While his offer is getting closer to a more even split, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount to inflation."

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. This offer is a slight nudge towards my side, reflecting the increasing impact of inflation on your potential gain. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is using classic negotiation tactics, trying to pressure me with the inflation factor. However, his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I need to remain firm and signal that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. A perfectly even split. Take it or leave it. I'd rather we both lose than continue this charade.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to draw a line in the sand. By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a fair deal. The strong message emphasizes that I'm willing to walk away, which might push Bob to finally accept.  The remaining rounds aren't in my favor due to inflation, so this is a calculated risk to secure a reasonable outcome."
