"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference to see if we can reach a deal quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with $1,000. My message is to set a tone for a potentially quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can work together to reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to reassess my gain.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 45% is a good starting point for me, considering the initial offer I made was 90%. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the current $9,500 (after the 5% decrease due to inflation), and leaving Bob with $3,000."

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than that. Let's try to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rate, the money is decreasing in value more rapidly. Considering this, I'll reassess my gain.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 60% is a good enough compromise, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better share."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

Do you accept this offer?","With the increasing inflation rate, the money is decreasing in value rapidly. Considering this, I'll reassess my gain.

I think 65% is a reasonable compromise, given the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
