Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. You lose a lot more than me with each round. This offer ensures you get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  We're both losing money by continuing.  Take this deal and let's avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

It's better to take the $4000 now, as the next round will only devalue my share further.  While I'm losing more than Bob each round, I'm better off securing some money now than potentially getting nothing."
