"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal early and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer isn't as good as my initial one, it's still a fair split considering the inflation. Accepting now means I secure 50% of the money, whereas rejecting and making an offer myself could lead to even lower gains due to the inflation."
