"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4000.

I'm not sure I want to meet Bob in the middle, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal this time. I'll offer a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Can you consider this offer, Bob?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice. Can we meet here? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4500 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately $4080.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as it's still a bit more in Bob's favor. However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation.
