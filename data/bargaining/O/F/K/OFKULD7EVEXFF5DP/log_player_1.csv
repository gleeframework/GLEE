# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than that. I was initially willing to accept a 60% share, and now Bob is offering me only 30% of the remaining money. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although he's offering me a slightly better deal than before, I'm still not satisfied with the 40% share. I was hoping for a more substantial increase from his previous offer. I'll keep negotiating to try to get a better deal!"

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think I deserve a slight edge""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, but I'm still holding out hope that I can get a slightly better deal."
