""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While the offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to see if I can get her to be more reasonable."
