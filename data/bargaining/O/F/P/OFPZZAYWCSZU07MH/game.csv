6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I know you value this money, so I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good deal for you in the first round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,Your offer was a bit too skewed Alice. I'm proposing a 45/55 split.  It's closer to even and accounts for the fact that the money loses value for you with each round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, my offer still stands.  Remember, the money is losing value for me every round. This is a fair deal for both of us, considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be realistic. I'm offering you 5200, which is a significant amount considering it's worth less and less with each round. Take the deal before it shrinks further!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need you to meet me halfway. This offer is a compromise - slightly better for you than the last, but still reflects the time pressure. Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is ridiculous.  I'm offering a perfectly even split to get this done. Take it or leave it - but leaving it gets us both $0!",Bob,6,
