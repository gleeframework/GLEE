Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be higher to compensate for the loss in value. This is still a relatively fair deal for both. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
