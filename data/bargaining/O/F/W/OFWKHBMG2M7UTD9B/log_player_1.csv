Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything, but offer Bob a tiny amount to hopefully get him to agree. I'm hoping the inflation will work in my favor in the following rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to take more, the inflation is a serious threat. Taking 100,000 now is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
