"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a ridiculous offer, even with inflation, it's better to reject and see what Alice will propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. This should be a fair offer considering the inflation that will be applied to Alice's next offer."
