"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and I get a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I take $60 and Bob takes $40, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division with me getting a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, how about this split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The 5% decrease in value due to inflation isn't significant enough to make me accept an offer that's less favorable than my initial proposal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI'll make a new offer where I take $57 and Bob takes $43, with a message suggesting that this is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a good deal for both of us. Don't let the money shrink further! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer this time. Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, which has now reached 14.26% less than the initial value, I think it's wise to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in the next round. The difference between our proposed splits is relatively small, and I believe this deal is reasonable for both of us. Let's finalize the agreement and split the money!### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
