"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This is to ensure a fair distribution considering the risk and potential future value loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that I'm taking on the risk of inflation by rejecting your offer. If we can't agree, I'll be making the offer in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
