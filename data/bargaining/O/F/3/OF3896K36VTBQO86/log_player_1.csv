"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial 100 dollars, which is 70 dollars, and Bob gets the remaining 30 dollars. I'm trying to be fair, but I'm also trying to get a slight majority to account for the potential inflation."
