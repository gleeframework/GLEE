5250.0,4750.0,"Let's split close to even, Bob, but factor in a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer. This ensures we both benefit before inflation cuts into it too much.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I believe a slightly higher share for me is reasonable as the money's value will decrease with each round. This way, we both still get a significant amount before its value drops further.",Bob,2,
