Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting stubborn, but the inflation is working heavily in our favor.  Her sense of ""fairness"" is irrelevant compared to the actual value she's losing. We need to push her further, but we are running out of rounds."

# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, we're running out of time. Accepting Alice's offer now guarantees a reasonable gain of $480,000. If we reject and continue pushing for a better deal, we risk walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
