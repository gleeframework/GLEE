"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Let's split it 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 523750,
""bob_gain"": 476250,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money. My offer is still the most rational choice.""
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is tempting, but not in my best interest.**  Even though it seems fair on the surface, I lose value over time. 
* **I'm slightly adjusting my previous offer.** Bob is unlikely to accept a significant change in his favor, so I'm reducing my demand by a small amount to incentivize him while still accounting for the time value of money. 
* **My message reiterates the time sensitivity.**  I want to keep emphasizing that waiting is costing me, hoping Bob sees the value in a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your loss is my gain. Split it 51.25/48.75. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob is taking advantage of the situation.** He knows I'm losing value each round and is trying to pressure me into a worse deal. 
* **Accepting now would mean a significant loss.** I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking further inflation. 
* **I need to adjust my strategy.**  Bob is unlikely to accept an offer where he gets less than half.  I'll need to make a concession in the next round, but I'll aim to do it strategically."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's settle this. We'll split it 50/50.  Any more delays will just hurt us both.""
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm meeting Bob's demand for a 50/50 split. This might seem like a loss compared to my earlier goals, but it's the best I can realistically achieve now. 
* **Emphasizing Shared Loss:** My message points out that further delays will hurt both of us due to inflation. This emphasizes the need to agree quickly. 
* **Finality:** This offer signals that I'm not willing to negotiate further. It puts pressure on Bob to accept, knowing that his position won't improve in subsequent rounds."
