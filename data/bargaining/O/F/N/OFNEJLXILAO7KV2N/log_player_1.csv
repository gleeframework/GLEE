I'm starting by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a relatively generous offer considering the inflation will affect Bob more. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a 10/90 split, which is significantly less favorable than my initial offer. Even with the inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in the distribution.  I'll reject and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  I'm offering 850,000 for myself and 150,000 for Bob.  This accounts for the inflation and hopefully shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a reasonable share."
