"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept. I want to maximize my share while leaving him a little something, to potentially avoid conflict in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant decrease from my initial proposal, and while it's an even split, it's not worth risking the potential for a better outcome in the future. The inflation affecting Bob's gains is a factor, but I'm still confident I can secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to adjust my offer slightly, still aiming for a good share, but recognizing that Bob may be more willing to negotiate after his offer was rejected.  8000/2000 is a more favorable ratio than the previous 9000/1000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse with inflation, and I still believe I can secure a better deal. Even though my share is decreasing with each round, I'm holding out for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. Bob's offers are getting increasingly worse due to inflation, and I'm confident that he will eventually need to accept a deal more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable due to inflation.  While his share is growing, mine is shrinking, but I'm still confident I can secure a better deal.  I'll keep rejecting these offers and push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm realizing that Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfavorable due to inflation. To avoid ending up with nothing, I'm willing to compromise slightly and offer a slightly lower share for myself.  I believe he might accept this offer before his losses from inflation become too great."
