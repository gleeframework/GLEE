"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I would gain $4000, which is less than my original proposal of $5000. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm trying to get a better deal by offering Bob a slightly smaller share, hoping he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less due to inflation, the 5800 I'll gain is still a decent amount, and it's higher than my previous proposal of 5500. I'm willing to take the deal to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to future inflation."
