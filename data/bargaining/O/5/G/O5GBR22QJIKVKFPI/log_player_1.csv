"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal. I'll keep a significant share for myself but still leave a decent amount for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, so I believe I can push for a more favorable split.  With inflation in play, waiting another round might give me a better position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still giving Bob a decent amount. I believe this offer is more fair, considering the inflation, and I hope it's enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much closer to my initial goal, and considering the significant impact of inflation, accepting this deal seems like the best option.  It's time to be practical and secure a decent share of the money before inflation erodes my gains further."
