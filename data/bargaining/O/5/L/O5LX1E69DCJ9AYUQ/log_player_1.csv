"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a good chunk of change, but don't expect me to go easy on you.""

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of $700,000, which is $560,000. Not a bad deal, but I'm not sure I want to give up $140,000.
