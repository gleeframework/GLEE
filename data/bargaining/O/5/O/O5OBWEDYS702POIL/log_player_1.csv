"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is actually the same as my initial offer, but with the money being worth 10% less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer since it's the same as my initial proposal, and I'm hoping for a better deal. 

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 4500
