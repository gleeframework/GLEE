This is getting tight, but I'm holding out for a better deal!  The inflation is really hitting hard, but I still believe I can get a better share."

I'm taking a gamble here. The inflation is really hurting, but I'm hoping that Bob will see that he's getting a better deal than before, and he'll accept this. We're down to the wire, and I need to get something!"

This is a very difficult decision, as the inflation has eroded my potential gains significantly. However, I'm forced to accept Bob's offer.  Even though I'm getting a tiny share, it's better than getting nothing at all. The risk of rejecting and getting zero is too high at this point.  I'm hoping that Bob will be generous in future negotiations if we have another chance."
