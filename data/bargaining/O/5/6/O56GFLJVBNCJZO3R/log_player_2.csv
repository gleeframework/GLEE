While 50/50 is tempting, I'm still holding out for more.  Inflation is starting to bite, but I can still get a better deal than this. Let's see what happens in the next round."

# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting lower, and I'm still losing value due to inflation. However, I believe I can still get a better deal if we keep negotiating. I'll reject this offer and see what Alice offers next round."

# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

The inflation is really starting to hit hard, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. This offer is less than my initial goal, but it's better than walking away empty-handed."
