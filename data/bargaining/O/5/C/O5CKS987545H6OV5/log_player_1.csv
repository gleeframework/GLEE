"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less, I need to adjust my expectations. However, I still think I can do better than 450,000. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

This is a 49-51 split, which I think is a fair compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a 48-52 split, which is relatively close to my previous offer. I'll accept this offer to get a better deal than I would in the next round.
