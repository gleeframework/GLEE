"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'll propose a 900k/100k split. It's a big advantage for me, but it gives Bob something to consider. Hopefully, he'll accept it and we can both walk away with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, even with the 10% inflation. I'll reject and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'll propose a 700k/300k split.  Since Bob rejected my last offer, I'm lowering my own share.  However, this still gives me a substantial amount, and it should incentivize Bob to accept before we go through another round of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is really hurting me. But I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to propose a 550k/450k split.  At this point, the inflation is hitting me hard, but I still think there's room for negotiation. This offer gives Bob a larger share than my previous offers, while still giving me a sizable portion.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept before things get even worse for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but the inflation is killing me.  While this offer gives Bob a much larger share, I'm taking a significant loss.  I'll accept it before the next round, as the value of my share will only continue to decrease."
