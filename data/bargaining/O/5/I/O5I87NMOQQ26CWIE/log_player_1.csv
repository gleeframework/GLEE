"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60%! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so he's still getting a larger share. I'm not sure I want to give him more than 50%.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to give up yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55% this time, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to inch his way up to 55%. I'm not sure I want to give him that much, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to hold firm and make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging on 55%, I'll meet you in the middle at 52%""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give Bob more than 52%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 52%, it's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for me with each round. But I'm not going to fall for it! Since his offer is the same as my previous offer, I'm not going to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not giving up!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and keeping some value for myself."
