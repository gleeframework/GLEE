"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. While the offer seems unfair at first glance, Alice's share loses value much faster than mine. I'm willing to gamble a bit to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Your share loses value quickly. This is a better deal for both of us in the long run.""
}
``` 

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **Exploiting the Inflation:** Alice's share is losing value much faster than mine. By offering her slightly more than last time, I'm hoping she'll see the advantage of taking a decent deal now rather than risking a worse outcome later. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** I'm not being greedy by asking for a majority of the money. I'm offering a solution that benefits both of us, considering the unusual circumstances. 
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, the pressure increases.  This offer aims to reach a fair agreement quickly before the inflation eats away at the value too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is feeling the pressure, but so am I.  She's only budged slightly, and the difference between her offer and my last one is getting smaller with each round of inflation. It's risky, but I'm hoping to push her a little further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer is the closest we'll get to a fair deal considering the shrinking pot. Time is running out!""
}
``` 

Here's my thought process:

* **Increased Urgency:** With each passing round, the stakes are getting higher for both of us. It's time to signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement quickly.
* **Shifting Focus:** Instead of emphasizing the difference in our gains, I'm highlighting the fairness of the split in light of the unique situation. 
* **Calculated Risk:** By increasing my demand slightly, I'm taking a calculated risk. However, the urgency of the situation might make Alice more receptive to an offer that gives her a slight edge over a 50/50 split, especially as the money continues to lose value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between our last offers. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'd prefer a 48/52 split, the reality is that the difference between her offer and my desired outcome is shrinking rapidly due to inflation.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal is increasingly risky. If she doesn't budge further, we'll be left with even less to divide in subsequent rounds. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** Accepting her compromise shows a willingness to be fair and avoids the risk of appearing too greedy, which could lead to her digging in her heels. 

It's not ideal, but taking this offer now guarantees a reasonable share before the value deteriorates further."
