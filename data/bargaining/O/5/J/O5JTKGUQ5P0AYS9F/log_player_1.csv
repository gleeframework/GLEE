Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair deal, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I need to make sure I get a fair share as well. Time is running out, and we both have to consider the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is suggesting a ""middle ground,"" the inflation is working heavily in our favor. Each round that Bob rejects an offer, the value decreases significantly for him, while it remains the same for us.  We need to keep applying pressure, but avoid being overly aggressive and risking him rejecting a deal altogether."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  It's a good deal for both of us considering the circumstances.  Let's be sensible and end this here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point, and the pressure is on Bob. By framing this as our ""final offer"" and emphasizing the decreasing value, we're increasing the pressure for him to accept a deal that's still favorable to us.  It's a calculated risk, as appearing too inflexible could backfire, but the potential reward of getting a larger share outweighs the risk at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small amount more than last round, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of the inflation. We have a few rounds left, and this is the best offer I can make without losing out myself. Let's end this game on a fair note. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but he's still trying to hold out for a slight advantage.  We need to remain firm.  We've shown a willingness to negotiate, but we can't let him dictate the terms at this late stage. The longer this goes on, the more desperate he'll become."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5050,
""bob_gain"": 4950,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and it's costing you more than me.  This is a fair compromise that lets us both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Offering Bob slightly more than his previous offer (while still securing a majority for ourselves) signals a willingness to compromise without caving to his demands.
* **Emphasize Urgency:**  We're nearing the end of the game, and each round lost significantly hurts Bob.  
* **Project Confidence:** We're framing this as a win-win situation, encouraging Bob to make the rational choice before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's end this now and split the money evenly.  It's the fairest outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's finally time to accept. While we could theoretically push for a slightly larger share, the risks now outweigh the potential rewards:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The difference between a 50/50 split and a slightly better deal is getting smaller with each round.
* **Bob's Desperation:**  Bob is clearly feeling the heat of the inflation and is likely to become increasingly irrational as we approach the final rounds. There's a real chance he'll refuse to budge from a 50/50 split, even if it means both players lose. 
* **Securing a Win:**  A 50/50 split guarantees us a win, whereas continuing the game introduces the very real possibility of walking away with nothing. 

It's been a calculated game of chicken, and we've successfully leveraged the inflation to our advantage. Accepting this offer secures a favorable outcome and avoids the risk of a last-minute loss."
