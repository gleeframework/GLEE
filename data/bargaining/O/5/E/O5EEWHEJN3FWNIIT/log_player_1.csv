Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any lower.  If you reject this, we both lose. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Bob's perception of the money's value is decreasing significantly with each round. This makes him more likely to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer. While he could be bluffing, there's a real risk he might reject further offers, leading to no deal and zero gain for both of us.
* **Decent Gain:**  $6,000 is a significant portion of the initial amount. Holding out for more might result in a worse outcome if Bob is serious about his ultimatum. 

It's a strategic decision based on the information available and the potential risks involved in further negotiation."
