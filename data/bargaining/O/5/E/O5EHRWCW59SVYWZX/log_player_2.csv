"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you can have 10%, but I'm open to negotiation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Think about it - it's a fair deal considering I'm taking the risk in round 2 with inflation looming.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 55/45 in my favor.  I'm confident this is a fair deal considering the potential for further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split in round 3 is better than risking a worse offer in later rounds as inflation eats away at the total value."
