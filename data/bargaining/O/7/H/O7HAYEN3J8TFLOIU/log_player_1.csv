"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing that Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. The message is a friendly offer to split the money 90-10, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but still a good chunk for me! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not getting a good enough share of the money, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a more aggressive offer from my side, but I think it's reasonable considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous, but you'll have to take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because the amount I would get ($150,000) is not worth much in today's devalued currency. I'll wait for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent chunk, but I need more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more aggressive than before. I'm trying to get a better share of the remaining money, considering the continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm being reasonable 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on the value of the money. I'm starting to get worried that I'll get nothing if I don't accept a decent offer soon.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $400,000 is a decent amount, considering the devalued currency, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
