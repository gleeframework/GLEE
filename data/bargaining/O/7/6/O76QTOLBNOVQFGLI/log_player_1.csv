I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, aiming for a big chunk of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit too much in his favor.  I'll reject and see if he's willing to negotiate further.  I'm not giving up that much!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try and come down a little from my first offer, but still aim for a significant share.  We're losing 5% each round, so I need to be assertive but also reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still pushing for a very uneven split. I'm willing to compromise, but this is still too much in his favor. I'm going to reject and see if he's willing to come down a bit more. We're losing a significant amount with each round due to inflation, and I don't want to get stuck with a really bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split this time.  With the inflation, the money is losing value quickly, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a very small share. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise now that we've both rejected each other's offers a couple of times."
