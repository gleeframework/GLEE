"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, let's see if we can do better later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split, but I'm giving myself a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both have a chance to propose in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'm now worth 80% of what I was in the first round, and Bob's offer is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

My current gain would be 80% of $6000, which is $4800, but Bob is offering me $4500. That's a bit less than what I would get if I accepted his offer.

I'll have to think carefully about this...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 80% = 64%). I'll aim to get a higher share this time.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""You offered me $4500, I'm offering you a bit less, but I'm hoping for a better deal this time""
}
```"
