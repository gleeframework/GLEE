Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  This is a more balanced starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not convinced that it's the best deal for me. I was hoping for a slightly better split. I'll reject this offer and make a new one.
