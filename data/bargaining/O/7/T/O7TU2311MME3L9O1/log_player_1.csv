"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with something. Since it's the first round, I want to start with a strong proposal. I believe Bob will be more likely to accept, as he'll get something, and there's still a lot of money left on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. While my gains have decreased by 5%, his gains have decreased by 10%, meaning the offer is even more unbalanced in his favor.  I'll reject this and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller amount than before, but it's still a decent sum, especially considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping he'll recognize that the money is losing value quickly and will accept this offer before it gets even worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair. Even though he's giving me a slightly higher share, inflation has eaten away significantly more of his money than mine. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to reject and make counter offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly again, but I'm still aiming for a 75% share.  Bob's offer was closer to a 50/50 split, and I'm hoping he'll realize that with inflation continuing to bite, my offer is still the better option for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, and my initial goal was to get a larger share, the impact of inflation is significant.  His offer is still worth more to me than rejecting it and potentially getting nothing in the end.  I'll accept this offer and secure at least half of the money."
