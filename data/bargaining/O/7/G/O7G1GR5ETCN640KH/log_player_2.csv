"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I can potentially get more than half if I wait. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value each round""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses value for Alice but not for me, I can try to take advantage of this by offering her less than half. Let's see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 45/55. It's better than what you offered, and I'm still losing value each round. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll try to push my luck a bit more. Since Alice is losing even more value this round, she might be more desperate to settle. I can try to get an even better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You're losing more value each round, so I'll take a bit more. It's still better than waiting for the next round, right?""}\n\n###\n\nI'll try to take advantage of Alice's desperation and offer her an even smaller share. Since the money is losing more value for her each round, she might be willing to accept a worse deal rather than waiting for the next round."
