Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  But I think a 60/40 split, in my favor this time, is a good starting point.  We need to act quickly though, as the money is losing value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
