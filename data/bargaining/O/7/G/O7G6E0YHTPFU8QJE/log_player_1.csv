"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the original amount. This leaves me with 60% of the original amount, which is 600,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective amount I'll get if I accept this offer. 

500,000 is 50% of the original amount, but since the money is worth 95% of its original value due to the 5% inflation, I'll actually get 500,000 * 0.95 = 475,000.

I'll decide to reject the offer since I can do better than that. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 10% inflation (5% in each of the two rounds), the money is now worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000 dollars, which is 45% of the original amount, and keeping 55% for myself."
