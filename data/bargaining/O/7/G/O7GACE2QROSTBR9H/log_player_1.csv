"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

The total amount of money is still $1,000,000, but my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the money, and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round.

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually a 52.5/47.5 split, which is even more favorable to me than my previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
