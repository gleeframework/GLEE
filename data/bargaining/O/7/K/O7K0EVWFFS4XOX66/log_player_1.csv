"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept his offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
