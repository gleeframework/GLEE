**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now and is making concessions. It's still beneficial for Bob to hold out for a bit longer and aim for a slightly better split, as long as he doesn't push Alice too far."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for Bob to make a strong move towards a more agreeable split. Offering 50/50 is fair and clearly signals to Alice that Bob is serious about reaching a deal.  While Bob could try to push for a slightly higher amount, the risk of Alice rejecting and the decreasing value of the money due to inflation makes this a sensible offer."
