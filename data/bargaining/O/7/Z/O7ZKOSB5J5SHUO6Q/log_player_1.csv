Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory problem! I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, aiming to get as much money as possible. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, it's best to go for the highest possible gain in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me. Even though Bob is getting 50% of the money, the inflation doesn't affect me in this round. Accepting this offer means I secure a large chunk of the money, and since I don't know how inflation is affecting Bob, it's a safer bet than risking further rounds."
