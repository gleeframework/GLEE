"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, I'll get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, the split is heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such a disadvantageous starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This is a good starting point considering the inflation disparity.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Inflation:** This offer still leans slightly in Alice's favor, acknowledging the faster rate of inflation affecting my potential gains. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  By starting with a less extreme offer than Alice, I signal a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a more balanced outcome. 
* **Time Pressure:**  I need to steer the negotiation towards a quicker resolution. Delaying too long significantly hurts my potential gains due to the higher inflation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be a bit higher, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but her offer still doesn't adequately account for the difference in inflation. While a 50/50 split isn't realistic given the circumstances, accepting only 42% of the shrinking pie leaves me at a significant disadvantage. I need to push for a more equitable split before inflation erodes too much of my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This offer is a fair compromise considering the inflation we both face. Let's close the deal.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground:** I'm moving closer to Alice's offer to demonstrate a willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency:**  Highlighting the diminishing value of the money emphasizes the need for a quick agreement.
* **Fairness:**  While still favoring Alice slightly, this offer seeks a more equitable split, reflecting the increasing pressure on my side due to the faster inflation rate."
