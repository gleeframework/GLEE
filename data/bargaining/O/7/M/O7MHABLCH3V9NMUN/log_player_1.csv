"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%. This seems like a fair starting point, and it's a good chunk of money for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'm effectively getting 500,000 / 0.8 = 625,000, which is more than my initial offer of 600,000. However, Bob is also getting 500,000, which is a significant amount.

I'll decide to reject this offer. It's still not enough for me.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, and I'm willing to give up a bit more to Bob in order to get a slightly higher share. This way, I'll get 550,000, which is worth 550,000 / 0.8 = 687,500 in real terms, and Bob will get 450,000, which is worth 450,000 / 0.8 = 562,500 in real terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Let's calculate the real value of the offer:

My gain is 400,000, and the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the real value of my gain is 400,000 / 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 777,778.

Bob's gain is 600,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, so it's 600,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm getting a higher real value than my previous offer, but it's still not a great deal for me. I'll decide to reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the continued inflation, and I'm willing to give up a bit more to Bob in order to get a slightly higher share. This way, I'll get 475,000, which is worth 475,000 / 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 921,471 in real terms, and Bob will get 525,000, which is worth 525,000 in real terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on me now!

Let's calculate the real value of the offer:

My gain is 300,000, and the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so the real value of my gain is 300,000 / 0.326 (1 - 0.673) = 921,456.

Bob's gain is 700,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, so it's 700,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm getting a relatively small real value compared to my previous offers, but it's still a decent amount. I'll decide to reject this offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my revised offer for Round 7:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling me now!

Let's calculate the real value of the offer:

My gain is 200,000, and the money is worth 79.03% less than in the first round, so the real value of my gain is 200,000 / 0.206 (1 - 0.794) = 969,512.

Bob's gain is 800,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, so it's 800,000.

I'm getting a relatively small real value compared to my previous offers, but it's still better than getting nothing. I'll decide to accept this offer.
