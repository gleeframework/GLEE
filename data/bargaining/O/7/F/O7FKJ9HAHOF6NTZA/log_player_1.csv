``` 

This is a tough one! While Bob's offer is essentially the reverse of my initial proposal, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. 

* **My perspective:** Accepting 60% now, though not ideal, gives me a guaranteed payout worth more than waiting for potentially better offers in later rounds.
* **Bob's perspective:**  He likely realizes the money is losing value quickly. Accepting 40% now might be his best bet to secure something.

Waiting longer is risky. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
