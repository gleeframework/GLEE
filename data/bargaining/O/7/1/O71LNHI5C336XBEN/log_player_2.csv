Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is valuable, but so is a fair deal. I'm making a counter-offer that acknowledges the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough spot. On the one hand, the offer is slightly worse than the one Bob turned down in Round 1. However, Alice's share is rapidly decreasing in value to her due to the inflation mechanic. 

* **Potential for a worse offer:** If Bob rejects this, there's a chance Alice's next offer will be even lower for him, as she might think he's desperate.  
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer the game goes, the less attractive Alice's offers are likely to become (from her perspective). There's a chance she might offer even less in future rounds. 

**Taking all this into account, it's probably safer for Bob to accept this offer to avoid risking a worse outcome in subsequent rounds.**
