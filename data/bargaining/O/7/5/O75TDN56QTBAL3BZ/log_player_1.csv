"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end the game early""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, which is a fair division of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 5% less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, I would gain $475,000 (95% of $500,000), and Bob would gain $500,000.

I think this is a reasonable offer, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think about it, but I'd like to try for a bit more""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 550:450 split, which is a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm still looking for a good deal for myself. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, I would gain $861,800 (95% of $900,000 x 0.926), and Bob would gain $600,000.

I think this is a reasonable offer, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to try to get a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise""

}
```

I'm proposing a 490:510 split, which is a compromise between our previous offers."
