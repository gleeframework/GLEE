Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll go a bit closer to 50/50, but I still think I should get more. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the money loses value for her. While her offers are getting closer to a more even split, they are still heavily in her favor. I believe I can push for a better deal, ideally closer to the 50/50 split I proposed earlier."

Round 6
