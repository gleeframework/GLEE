"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good deal for me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the nominal values.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going below 55% for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split in my favor, but still being reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to your 55% offer, but I still want a decent share 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the nominal values.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. The 46/54 split is close enough to my target of 55%, and I'd rather not continue the game and risk getting a worse deal due to further inflation."
