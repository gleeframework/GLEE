Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm sure we can both do better in the next round.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though the offer is bad, the money will be worth more to me if I wait a round and make my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more equitable split.  This is the best deal you'll get before the money loses value for me.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer.  While I would like more, the value of the money will continue to decrease if I wait for another round."
