"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, with me getting the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in my favor, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, and Bob's offer is 60/40 in his favor, I'm not getting a great deal. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. I'll need a better offer to consider.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob now, and I'm not getting a great deal from him, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70% of the remaining money, but I'm willing to give you 30%. I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to take a bigger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
