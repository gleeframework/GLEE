Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share to compensate for the inflation that's affecting me more. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the deal is getting worse with every round that passes, particularly for me. Accepting a 42/58 split now is better than risking an even worse offer from Bob in the future as the money continues to devalue."
