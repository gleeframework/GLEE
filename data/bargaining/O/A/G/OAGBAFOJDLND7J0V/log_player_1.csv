"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave you with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal for you. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
* Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.
