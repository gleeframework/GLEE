"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a moderate cut, let's see if you'll take it 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for you, Bob. I'm not sure I'm ready to give up that much yet.""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and see if Bob will make a more appealing offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, my offer will be slightly adjusted accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm still looking for a fair split, but I'm willing to compromise. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for future negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to take a more aggressive stance, let's see if you'll meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the reduced value of money, Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is actually a more significant concession than it would have been in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you're pushing hard, but I think this is a fair compromise. Let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally conclude the game!"
