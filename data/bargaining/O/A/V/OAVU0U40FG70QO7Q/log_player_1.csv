# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, I'm now more cautious. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm less concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm not sure if Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer for now.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 40% of the original $100. However, I'm not sure if I should push for more, given the inflation.

I'll reject this offer for now.
