Round 5

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing. Waiting longer means getting significantly less, even if Bob manages to secure a slightly better deal in a later round.
* **Alice's pattern:** Alice has consistently aimed for the larger share but has shown a willingness to increase Bob's portion slightly with each round.  It's unlikely she'll drastically change her approach now.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks getting to a point where even an even split is worth less than the current offer due to inflation. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes taking a decent deal in the face of a shrinking pie is better than holding out for an ideal outcome that might never come."
