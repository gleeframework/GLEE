I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to see how Bob reacts. I'll keep in mind the inflation effect but try to avoid being too greedy in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer. While it's true I'm losing value due to inflation, Bob's offer is extremely unfair, especially considering he's also facing inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a drastic disadvantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more balanced while still accounting for the inflation. I'm aiming for a more equitable split this time."
