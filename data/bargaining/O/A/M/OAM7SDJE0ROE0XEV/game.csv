6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'll be losing more value in the following rounds due to the higher inflation rate.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"Considering the inflation, I believe a slightly higher share for me is reasonable, as the money loses less value for me than for you.",Bob,2,
,,"While I understand your point about the inflation, Bob, I believe your proposal is still unfairly skewed in your favor. Let's find a more balanced agreement.",Alice,2,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. This offer accounts for the inflation but is still fair to both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Given the increasing inflation disparity, I believe a larger share for me is justified to offset the difference in value loss.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to negotiate, but your demands are becoming unreasonable. If you're not more willing to compromise, we'll be stuck here forever.",Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. A straight 50/50 split.  It's clear you're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'd rather walk away with nothing than be exploited.  Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
