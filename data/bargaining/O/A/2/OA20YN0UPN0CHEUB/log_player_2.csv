"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, it's better to see if Alice will offer a better deal in the next round, especially as the money will be worth less for me if I reject."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While the offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still not as good as my previous offer. I'm hoping Alice will come around to a more even split in the next round.  I'm not willing to accept less than 500,000 yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go a little higher than our last offer to make this work.  Let's split it 550/450.""}

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still offering less than my last proposal, and the inflation is starting to hurt. I'm going to hold out for a better offer, as this trend doesn't seem to be moving in my favor."

Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to 525,000, but I need to see some movement from you. Time is running out.""}

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the offer is slightly better than Alice's previous offer, I'm still losing a lot of money due to inflation.  I'm hoping Alice will come around to a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 445000 
# Alice gain: 555000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While this is still a significantly less favorable deal than I would prefer, the inflation is taking a huge toll, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting.  It's better to take what I can get than lose it all."
