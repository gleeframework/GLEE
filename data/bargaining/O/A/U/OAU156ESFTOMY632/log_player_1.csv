"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money doesn't lose value for Bob, he might be inclined to wait for a better offer. However, I'll appeal to his sense of fairness and see if we can end the game quickly.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's better than both of us losing money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm not willing to accept an uneven split in Bob's favor. Since Bob doesn't lose any value, he might be more inclined to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor. Since the money is worth 20% less for me than in the first round, and considering another 20% decrease in value for the next round, I'm willing to compromise. I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness again and the fact that he doesn't lose any value over time. Let's see if he accepts this offer.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
