Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. Meet me in the middle of our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  I'm offering a deal that's good for both of us. Let's not get greedy.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Inflation is hitting me harder, after all. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the fact that inflation hits her harder. However, her offer still heavily favors her. It's important to remain firm and aim for a deal closer to even, especially since we're nearing the halfway point of the rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 49, ""alice_gain"": 51, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be reasonable and split this almost evenly.  Take it before inflation eats away any more of the pie!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We need to start applying more pressure and making Alice realize time is running out. Offering a nearly even split that slightly favors Alice might seem desperate, but it emphasizes fairness while still giving us a marginal advantage. The message stresses urgency and the shrinking value of the money due to inflation."
