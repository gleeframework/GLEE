"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but I'm trying to be fair while still maximizing my potential gain. I'm confident Bob will accept this offer, as it is still a decent share for him.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is less than what I was initially offered, and even with the inflation, it's not a good deal. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to stick to my original strategy of trying to get a slightly larger share.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'll try to make him a counter-offer that is still in his best interest while also reflecting the loss of value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than his previous offer, and considering the inflation, it's definitely not worth it for me. I'll reject this and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation has been hitting both of us hard. It's time to make a compromise.  This offer gives us both an equal share, recognizing the significant devaluation of the money. Let's call it a day and avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is a huge step backwards for me, even taking inflation into account. Bob's offer continues to decrease while my share continues to shrink. I'm unwilling to accept this, and I'll propose something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

It's clear Bob is trying to get the best of the deal, and with inflation hitting him harder, he's willing to take a smaller share.  This offer is a good compromise, as I take on a slight loss due to inflation, but I'm confident Bob will find it reasonable and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is just not acceptable, even with the inflation. I've already taken a significant cut, and this offer would leave me with a very small share of the money. I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

It's clear that we're both struggling with inflation. This offer reflects that reality, but it also acknowledges that I am not willing to take a further reduction in my share.  I hope Bob will accept this, as it's a fair compromise given the circumstances."
