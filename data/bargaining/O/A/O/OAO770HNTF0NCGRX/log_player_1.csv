I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I'm the first to propose, I want to maximize my share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the 40/60 split is a decent offer considering the inflation. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
