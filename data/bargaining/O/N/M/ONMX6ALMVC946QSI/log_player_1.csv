"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, $4000 is equivalent to $4000 / 0.9 = $4444.44 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, considering Bob's gain is worth 20% less, but he's still getting $6000, which is equivalent to $6000 / 0.8 = $7500 in the first round's value.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim to get a bigger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount, in the hopes that he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a better split 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round's money:

My gain of $4800 in this round is worth $4800 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = $6605.92 in the first round's value.
Bob's gain of $5200 in this round is worth $5200 / 0.5192 (1 - 0.4808) = $10030.25 in the first round's value.

Considering the significant difference in the equivalent values, I think I'm getting a relatively better deal this time. I'll accept this offer.
