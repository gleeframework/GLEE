"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80% for myself.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 800,000 dollars and Bob will get 200,000 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. This ensures fairness and avoids any potential regret. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I'd get in Round 2 are:

* My gain: 500,000 * 0.9 = 450,000
* Bob's gain: 500,000

Considering the reduced value of money, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. I'd rather try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50-50 is the best deal, considering the inflation. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so it's worth 90% of the original value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30% and keep 70%. It's a fair compromise, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the 50-50 split, while still being reasonable."
