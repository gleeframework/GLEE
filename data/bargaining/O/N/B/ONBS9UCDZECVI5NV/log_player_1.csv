"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% as I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'm not too thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining money, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 400,000 and call it a day."
