"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a slightly more balanced split, but I'm still holding out for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd receive are:

* My gain: 700,000 * 0.8 = 560,000
* Bob's gain: 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. It's a slightly more balanced split, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with a reduced amount due to inflation.
