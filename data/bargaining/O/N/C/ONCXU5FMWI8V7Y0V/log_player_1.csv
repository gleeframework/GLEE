"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 30, I'll take the rest 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping for a better deal, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. On the other hand, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I might be able to get a better deal in the next round...

I'll reject this offer and see what happens next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
