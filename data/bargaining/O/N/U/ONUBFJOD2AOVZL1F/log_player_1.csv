"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a chance to secure a decent amount, Alice,  before inflation eats into your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
