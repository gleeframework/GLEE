Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 6000, but I think it's still a fair deal.  If we keep going, my share will continue to decrease while yours stays the same. Let's end this before it gets worse for both of us.

# Alice gain: 6000
