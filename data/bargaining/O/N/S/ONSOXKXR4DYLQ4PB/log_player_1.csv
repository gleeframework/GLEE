This is a tough situation. Here's why I'm making this decision:

* **Rapidly Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is severe. Waiting any longer means the offer, even if slightly better, will be worth significantly less due to the 20% decrease per round.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems unwilling to budge much from this split. There's a risk he might offer even less in the next round, and the loss due to inflation might make that offer worse than the current one.

While not ideal, accepting now guarantees something rather than risking a worse outcome in the next round."
