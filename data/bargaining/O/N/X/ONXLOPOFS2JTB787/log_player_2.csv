"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm happy to split it fairly, Alice. Let's both get a good share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair share, Bob, but let's be realistic. This offer considers the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though it's not a perfect split, it's better to take what I can get before the value drops further."
