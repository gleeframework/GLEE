"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, so he might be tempted to accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob half of the money. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I was thinking of getting a bit more than 50. Can we discuss further?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight edge.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a bit more than the 50/50 split, but I'm still keeping a slight advantage for myself."
