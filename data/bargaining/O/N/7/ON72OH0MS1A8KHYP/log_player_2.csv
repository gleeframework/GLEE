Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need you to meet me halfway. Time is running out, let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now.  While her offer is slightly better, it's still advantageous for me to hold out a bit longer. I'll aim for a more significant split in my favor in the next round."

Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the move towards a more even split.  How about we settle this now with a slight edge to me?  It's a win-win before inflation eats away at your share even more.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm making another compromise. This is a fair deal, especially given the time pressure. Let's be sensible and take it. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the heat of the shrinking pot, but her concessions are still too small. I need to push for a more significant advantage while she's feeling the pressure.  We're past the halfway point, but I'm betting she'll become more agreeable as the rounds progress."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. Let's be realistic. This offer gives us both something, and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing my advantage here, knowing that Alice is increasingly feeling the impact of the shrinking pot.  It's a slight gamble, as it's a more aggressive split than my last offer. However, the risk of getting nothing is becoming very real for Alice, and this offer might be tempting enough for her to accept."
