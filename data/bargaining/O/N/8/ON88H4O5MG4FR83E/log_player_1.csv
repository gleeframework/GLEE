Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI will accept Bob's offer. Due to the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action to maximize my value. Inflation has reduced the value of the money I gain by 48.8% compared to the first round, while Bob's gain is only reduced by 14.26%. This disparity makes it increasingly disadvantageous for me to continue the game in hopes of a better offer in future rounds. By accepting now, I secure a tangible amount that, despite being less than my initial proposals, is more valuable than the potentially diminishing returns from further rounds."
