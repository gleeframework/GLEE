"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed""
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 550,000 is actually worth 440,000 in real terms, and Bob's gain of 450,000 is worth 427,500 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, considering the initial offer I made was 600,000 for me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
