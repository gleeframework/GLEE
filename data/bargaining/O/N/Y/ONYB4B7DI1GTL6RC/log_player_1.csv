"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer considering we're just starting out. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55-45, I think that's more fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of 45-55, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 48, you can try to do better next round""
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly better split than Bob's previous offer, while still leaving room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We can both get more if we keep rejecting, but the money will be worth less each round.  
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to wear me down with the threat of inflation. But I'm not convinced that an even split is the best option. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to make a move. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better split, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
