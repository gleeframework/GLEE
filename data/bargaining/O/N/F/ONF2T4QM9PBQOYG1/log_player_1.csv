"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\nMy offer is to take $600,000 for myself and give $400,000 to Bob. Given the inflation rate, where the money loses 0% value for me but 5% for Bob with each passing round, this initial offer seems reasonable, as it incentivizes Bob to accept early to avoid further devaluation of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. This offer accounts for that while still being fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation affecting his share, his proposal still gives him a larger portion of the money. Given that the inflation impacts Bob's share and not mine, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round, especially since the value of the money remains constant for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I've adjusted the offer. It's still generous, given the circumstances.""}\n\nMy new offer reflects the changing dynamics due to inflation. Since Bob's share devalues by 5% each round and mine remains constant, I've adjusted the proportions to reflect this, taking a larger share but still offering Bob a significant amount, considering the devaluation he faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  The inflation is quickly eroding the value, and this split ensures we both walk away with a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his mention of it being his final offer and the impact of inflation, the split he proposes still doesn't fully account for the significant devaluation his share has undergone. Given that my share's value remains unchanged, I believe there's room for a better deal, especially since Bob's share is now worth 14.26% less than initially. I'll push for a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Given the substantial impact of inflation on your share, this offer is more than reasonable. It's advisable to accept now, as further rounds will only decrease your share's value.""}\n\nMy new offer takes into account the significant devaluation of Bob's share, now worth 14.26% less than initially. Considering this substantial decrease and the fact that my share's value remains constant, I've adjusted the proportions to reflect the current state of the money's value. I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but it's still a considerable amount, and accepting now would be in his best interest to avoid further devaluation."
