Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower amount, but I think this is a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and 4000 for me seems a bit low.
