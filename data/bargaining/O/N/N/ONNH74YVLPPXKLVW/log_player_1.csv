"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess later.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get the same value for my share. However, for Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so his share is worth 10% less than it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a smaller share than I got in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a chance to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up much more ground 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's share is worth 27.1% less than it was in the first round, so he's giving up more value than he was in the previous rounds.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This offer seems reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it to end the game."
