Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a very lopsided offer. I'm hoping to get most of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob something small to incentivize him to accept. This strategy is risky, but it's the most likely way to get the most money in the first round.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer.  I'm not sure how inflation is affecting Bob, but this is the best deal I'm likely to get.  It's time to get this over with!"
