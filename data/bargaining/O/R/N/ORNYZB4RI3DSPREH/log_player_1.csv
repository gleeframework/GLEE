"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. I'll give you $1000 and keep $9000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's the fairest way to start, and we can adjust later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth $4000.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain of $10,000 is worth $8000 due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Take $3000 and let me have $7000. It's a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant amount for myself."
