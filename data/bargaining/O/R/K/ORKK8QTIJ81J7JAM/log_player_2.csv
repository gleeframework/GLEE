"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the rules and the impact of inflation.
In this game, each round decreases the value of the money by 20% for Bob and 5% for Alice. Understanding this is crucial for making strategic offers.

### Step 2: Analyze Alice's first offer and the implications of rejecting it.
Alice offered Bob $100,000 and herself $900,000. Given the significant difference and the impact of inflation, Bob rejected this offer to try for a better deal, considering the money's decreasing value over rounds.

### Step 3: Calculate the adjusted value of money for Round 2.
For Bob, the money's value decreases by 20% each round. So, in Round 2, the $1,000,000 is worth $800,000 to Bob. For Alice, it decreases by 5%, making it worth $950,000.

### Step 4: Determine a strategic offer that considers the value adjustments.
Given the adjusted values, a strategic offer should aim to maximize Bob's gain while being reasonable enough for Alice to consider, given the decreasing value of money for both.

### Step 5: Formulate an offer.
Considering the adjusted values and aiming for a more equitable division that both might accept, Bob could offer a division that slightly favors himself due to his higher loss from inflation but remains fair.

### Step 6: Attach a persuasive message.
The message should highlight the fairness of the offer, considering the inflation impact, and encourage Alice to accept by emphasizing the mutual benefit of ending the game early.

### Step 7: Finalize the offer in the requested JSON format.

The final answer is:
```
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle to benefit both of us. Early agreement benefits us both.""
}
