"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you $30, and I'll get $70. This is a relatively generous offer, considering we're starting with $100. What do you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth less. Since Bob's offer is now 50-50, I'll consider it. However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
