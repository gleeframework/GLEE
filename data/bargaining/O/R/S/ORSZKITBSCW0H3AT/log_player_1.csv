"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $600,000, which is 60%. I've included a message saying ""Let's divide fairly"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and we can both walk away satisfied. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Let's find a compromise. This considers the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The fact that the money is worth 10% less for me and only 5% less for Bob means that time is on his side, but I still want to try to get a bigger share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $450,000 and I'll take $550,000. Given the effects of inflation, this offer is closer to a 50-50 split in terms of the value we'll actually receive. My message suggests meeting in the middle, which I think is a fair compromise considering the time value of money."
