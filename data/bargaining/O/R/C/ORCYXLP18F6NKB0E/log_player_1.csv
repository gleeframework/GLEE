"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my potential gain of $400,000 in this round is actually worth only $360,000 compared to the $800,000 I could have had in the first round. Bob's offer is a significant improvement, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

I'll reject this offer for now. It's still not a great deal for me, considering the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 1, so my potential gain is even more valuable.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a more balanced offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the offer from Bob, I realize that my potential gain of $450,000 in this round is actually worth only $360,000 compared to the $800,000 I could have had in the first round. However, it's still a decent offer, and I'm not sure if I should pass it up.

I'll accept this offer.
