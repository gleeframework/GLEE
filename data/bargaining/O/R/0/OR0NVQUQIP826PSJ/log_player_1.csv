"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me less than I proposed in the first round. However, the inflation effect is significant, and I'll have to consider the long-term implications.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is taking a toll! The money is worth 20% less than it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation and trying to stay competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains!

Considering the offer, I think I'll have to accept this one. The difference between 4500 and 5500 is relatively small, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
