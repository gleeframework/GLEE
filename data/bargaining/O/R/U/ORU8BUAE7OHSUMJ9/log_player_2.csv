"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This is to encourage fairness and cooperation in our first round. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I (Bob) would prefer more, accepting this offer in the first round sets a positive tone for cooperation. It's also important to consider the potential impact of inflation on future rounds. It's likely that Alice may not offer such a favorable split later on."
