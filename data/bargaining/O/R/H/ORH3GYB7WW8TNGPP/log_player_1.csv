"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair split, but I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority, huh? That's a bold move!

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is actually:

* Alice gain: 50
* Bob gain: 40 (due to inflation, his 50 is actually worth 40)

I'll accept this offer.
