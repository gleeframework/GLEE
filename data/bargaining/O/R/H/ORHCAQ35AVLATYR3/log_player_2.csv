"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! How about an even split? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Bot\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I can try to negotiate a better deal. \n\n###\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's response?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Bot\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Alice $40, which is still a significant amount, but less than the even split she initially proposed. Since the money is worth 10% less for her in each subsequent round, she might be inclined to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation. \n\n###\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's response?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a fairer share. How about this? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again, as I believe I can negotiate an even better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 19% less for Alice now, she may be more willing to compromise to avoid further devaluation. \n\n###\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's response?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You're losing value fast, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Alice $35, which is less than her previous offer, but still a significant amount. Since the money is worth 19% less for her now, and will be worth even less in the next round, she may be inclined to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth the same for me, but decreasing in value for Alice. \n\n###\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's response?"
