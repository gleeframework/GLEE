Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's the best you'll get considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**Situation:**

* **Inflation is hurting me more:**  My potential gains shrink faster with each round.
* **Alice is getting firmer:** Her offers haven't changed much, and she's implying this is her last one.
* **Next round is risky:** If I reject and my offer fails, I'm relying on Alice to be somewhat generous in a final round.

**Analysis:**

* **Accepting:**  I get $40, which is significantly less than my initial goal, but better than what I was offered in Round 3.
* **Rejecting:** I'm gambling. I *might* get Alice to agree to a slightly higher amount in the next round, but there's a real chance it backfires, and I end up with even less.

**Decision:**

This is a game of risk tolerance.  Given the high stakes of the next round, and the fact that Alice's offer is better than her previous one, I'll play it safe.
