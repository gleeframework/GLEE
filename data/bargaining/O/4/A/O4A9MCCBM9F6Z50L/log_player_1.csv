Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 4:1""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets $2,000. The message I'm sending to Bob is that I'm proposing a fair split, with a 4:1 ratio in my favor."
