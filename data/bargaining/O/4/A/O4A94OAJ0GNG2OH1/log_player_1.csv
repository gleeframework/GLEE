I'm going for a classic 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive opening, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it rather than risk getting even less in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very aggressive! While 3000 is better than nothing, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided split so early in the game. I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor this time. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident I can secure a larger share. It's a good balance between being fair and maximizing my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky.  I'm not thrilled with a 45/55 split, but inflation is hitting hard, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round. It's time to cut my losses and secure something."
