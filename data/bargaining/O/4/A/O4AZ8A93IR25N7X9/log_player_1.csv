# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI have decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems more balanced, I believe I can get a better deal considering the inflation affects Bob's gain more than mine. Let's proceed to the next round!"
