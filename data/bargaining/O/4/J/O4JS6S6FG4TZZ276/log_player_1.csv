"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000. I want to maximize my gains in the first round, knowing that inflation will reduce the value of the money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the value of the money has decreased, accepting this offer guarantees me $1,000, whereas rejecting it risks losing any money in future rounds."
