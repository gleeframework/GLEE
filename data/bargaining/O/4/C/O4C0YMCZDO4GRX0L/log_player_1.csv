"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small amount, but it's a fair start. Let's talk later.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount of money, but I'm keeping the majority of it for myself. The message is a friendly way of saying that I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not giving away the whole pie just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness. This equal split is just and beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, the new amounts are:

* My gain: 900000 * 0.9 = 810000
* Bob's gain: 100000 * 0.8 = 80000

Considering Bob's new offer, I see that he's proposing an equal split, which is a significant concession from his previous offer. I think it's a reasonable proposal, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

I accept Bob's offer.
