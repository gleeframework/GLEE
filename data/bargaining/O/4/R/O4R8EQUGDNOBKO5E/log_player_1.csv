"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'll take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar. Since the money is worth less to Bob in each round, I figure he'll accept this offer to avoid getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer.  While it's a much fairer split, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Even though Bob's money is worth less each round, he's still losing value, and he'll likely want to get something before it's worth nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm confident that Bob will accept. Since I've rejected his previous offer, he's now on the losing end of inflation. He's likely to accept a small gain over getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer.  While Bob is getting a significant share, I'm still confident I can do better. I've rejected two offers already, and Bob is losing value with each round due to inflation.  He'll likely be willing to offer more to get a deal before he's left with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping a majority for myself. Bob is now losing value on his money at an accelerating rate due to inflation. I'm hoping this offer will be enough for him to take before he's left with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 333333 
# Bob gain: 666667 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While I'm getting a smaller share than I hoped for, Bob is getting a much larger share, and his money is rapidly losing value due to inflation. I've rejected several offers, and if I reject this one, there's a real chance I'll end up with nothing in the next round. It's time to take what I can get."
