It's a very unequal split, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  Let's see what I can negotiate."

Let's start with a fair split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a very unequal split, and I'm hoping to get closer to a 50/50 split. I'm also aware of the inflation, so I need to be mindful of that as we move forward."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm willing to give a bit more ground, but I'm still aiming for a more even split. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Alice."
