# Alice's message: Let's split it 3:1. I'll take $750000 and you'll get $250000. It's fair and we can move on quickly.

# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60:40 split. I'll take $600000 and you'll get $400000. This maintains a fair balance considering inflation and our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
