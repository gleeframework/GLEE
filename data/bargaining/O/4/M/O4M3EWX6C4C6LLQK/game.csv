750000.0,250000.0,Let's split it 3:1. I'll take $750000 and you'll get $250000. It's fair and we can move on quickly.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable way to divide the money.  Let's move on to the next round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60:40 split. I'll take $600000 and you'll get $400000. This maintains a fair balance considering inflation and our previous offers.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm willing to go up to 600000 for myself, but I think it's fair that we split the remaining amount evenly. Let's see if we can agree on this.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
