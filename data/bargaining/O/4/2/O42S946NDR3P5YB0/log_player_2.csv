"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept a deal where I get $1 and Alice gets $999,999. I'll wait to see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable here, Alice.  I'll take the majority, but you'll get a fair share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle, Bob.  It's the fairest way to go, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll take the 500,000.  It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk Alice getting a better deal in the next round."
