"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a risky move, but I think it's the best way to maximize my potential gains in the early rounds.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  Let's split the money evenly!"
