"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is more fair. It reflects our equal contributions to this game, and I'm willing to share a larger portion with you this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
