# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 75/25 split. Here's my response:

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables and meet me in the middle. I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 50/50 split, but it's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk going home with nothing. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I'll take the 50/50 split. It's better than going home with nothing!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we'll split the remaining amount 50/50. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than risking it all."
