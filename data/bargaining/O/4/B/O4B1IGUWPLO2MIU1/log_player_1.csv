"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your initial offer, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of rejecting your first offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is not as generous as it initially seems.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority. Let's compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal, but I still want a bit more. This is my last generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less, and Bob's offer is now more generous than mine. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'm getting a good deal, and it's better than risking going to the next round with even lower-value money."
