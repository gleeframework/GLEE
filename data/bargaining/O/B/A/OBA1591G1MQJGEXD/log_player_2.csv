Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the value of the potential gains for Bob is diminishing significantly due to inflation. Accepting Alice's offer, while not ideal, prevents further losses in the following round. 

Let's analyze:

* **Round 1:** Bob rejects 450,000 (550,000 for Alice).
* **Round 3:** Bob rejects 400,000 (600,000 for Alice).
* **Round 5:** Bob is offered 350,000 (650,000 for Alice).

If Bob rejects this offer, he risks getting an even lower offer in Round 6, where the inflation will further erode his potential gains. Accepting the current offer cuts losses. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice is being truthful about her ""final offer."" There's always a risk she might negotiate further, but the potential loss for Bob is now outweighing the potential gain."
