Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  I'll take $55, and you get $45. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
