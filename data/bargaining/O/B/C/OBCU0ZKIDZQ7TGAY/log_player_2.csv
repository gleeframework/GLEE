"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30.  It's important to settle this early, as the value decreases with each round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept such a lopsided deal. Bob can try to negotiate a better split."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair! We each take $50. It's a good starting point, and we can avoid losing value with each round.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and the money is losing value, especially for you.  My offer is still on the table: $65 for me, $35 for you. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While the offer is better than the first round, the value for Bob is significantly decreased due to inflation. Bob can still try to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I understand the time pressure, Alice. But we both lose if we wait too long. Let's compromise: I'll take $45, and you can have $55. It's a fair deal considering the inflation.""
