Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to take a bit more, while still giving Alice a decent share.

Take this deal and you'll still get a good chunk of cash!""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting a bit tired of this game.  Let's split it 45-55, and we can both go home with some money.  We're both losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a good deal, considering the inflation is really starting to hurt Alice's gains. I'm getting a bigger share, and we're both getting some money, so I'm happy to accept this offer and end the game!"
