"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This gives me a significant portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, my initial offer would have been equivalent to 712500 for me and 287500 for Bob.

Bob's offer is a significant departure from the initial proposal, and it's a bit more generous to him than my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

Here's my new offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

Bob's offer in round 4 is a significant departure from his previous offer, and it's a very small amount for me.
