"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll be eager to end the game quickly and take the $2000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a fairer split. Let's avoid more rounds and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. My goal is to get as much as I can, and I think I can do better than 4000. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal.

```

Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more fair given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money being worth less and less, I'll need to be even more strategic.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm not convinced that 4500 is a fair share, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly, but I also don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed 5000.

I'll accept Bob's offer. At this point, I'd rather have a guaranteed 5000 than risk getting a smaller share in a future round.
