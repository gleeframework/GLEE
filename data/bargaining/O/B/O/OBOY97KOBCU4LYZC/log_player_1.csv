"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message that suggests this is a fair division. This opening offer allows room for negotiation while also setting a benchmark for future proposals. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next rounds. Accepting a 45-55 split in Bob's favor after I initially proposed a 55-45 split in my favor would be a significant concession. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'm adjusting my initial offer to a 52-48 split in my favor. This is a slight concession from my original proposal but still reflects the decreasing value of the money. By suggesting ""meet me in the middle,"" I'm framing this as a compromise and inviting Bob to find a mutually acceptable agreement. Let's see how Bob responds!"
