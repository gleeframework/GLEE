"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. You can't go wrong with 90%!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's split it 90/10, but you can keep the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to aim for a more balanced split. The fact that he's offering me the smaller share this time around makes me think he's trying to get me to commit to a lower amount.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a more aggressive split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 60/40 this time. We can both get a decent share and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to appeal to my sense of compromise.

Considering the inflation has taken a significant toll on the money's value, I think a 60/40 split is a reasonable offer. I'd rather accept this offer and get a decent share than risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.
