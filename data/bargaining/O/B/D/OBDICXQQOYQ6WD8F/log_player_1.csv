"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000$ - 100,000$ split, favoring myself slightly. This should be a good starting point, as it's a substantial amount for both of us, and it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a drastic change from the previous round. I'm not willing to accept such a large loss in my share. The 20% inflation on Bob's gain is more than enough to make up for the 5% on my gain. I'll counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose a 700,000$ - 300,000$ split. I'm reducing my share from the first round, but I'm still taking a larger share than Bob offered. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a fair share.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."
