"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 400,000 is now worth 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 460,000 is now worth 460,000 * 0.727 = 334,620.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4. It's not a bad deal, considering the inflation and the fact that we've been negotiating for a few rounds.
