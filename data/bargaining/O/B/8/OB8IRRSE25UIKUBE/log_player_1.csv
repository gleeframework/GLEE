"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This way, we both get a good share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option, especially since I'm worth 10% less than I was in the first round. I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for the next round to make my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60/40 split.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's be reasonable and try to reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, especially since I'm losing value at a faster rate than Bob. I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for the next round to make my next offer.

Also, I'm starting to get a bit worried about the time running out, so I'll try to make my next offer a bit more aggressive."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I need to make a strong move to get a good share. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000, which is $7,000, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $3,000."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  It's time to be realistic.  This is my final offer.  If you reject it, we risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not happy about it, but I think Bob's offer is a good compromise at this point. I'm losing value at a faster rate than Bob, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll accept his offer and take the $3,000."
