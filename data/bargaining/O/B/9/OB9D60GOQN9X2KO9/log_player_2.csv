"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk too. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer Alice, but I'm feeling ambitious. How about this split instead?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. We both get a good chunk, and we avoid the risk of losing it all to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, inflation is working against me.  I need to aim for a larger share while it's still significantly valuable."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""50/50 is tempting Alice, but inflation is a factor.  This split accounts for the diminishing value over time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer!  I'm willing to give up a little more, but we need to make sure both of us come out ahead.  How about this split? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but with inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount to inflation. I'm hoping Alice is willing to move closer to a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the time pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop dancing around it.  I need to factor in the inflation, and this is a fair split that considers the time pressure.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 45/55.  This is a fair compromise considering inflation, and it ensures we both get something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a good deal considering the circumstances. Here's why:

* **Beating Inflation:** While not ideal, 55% at this stage is better than risking further inflation eating into my potential gains in later rounds. 
* **Alice is Moving:** Alice is clearly feeling the time pressure too and willing to negotiate. Accepting now secures a decent sum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more is risky.  We're past the halfway point, and there's a real chance of walking away with nothing if we can't reach an agreement."
