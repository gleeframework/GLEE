"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering we both lose value over time.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to stick with the 60/40 split, but this time with the opposite distribution. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation. Now, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45."
