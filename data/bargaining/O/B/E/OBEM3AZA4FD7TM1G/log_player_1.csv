"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure a good amount before inflation takes its toll."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  Even though it's less than what I offered Bob, the inflation rate is higher for me. It's worth waiting to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this round, hoping to entice him to accept. The inflation rate is still higher for me, but I need to secure a deal before the value drops too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While it's a significantly lower share than what I initially hoped for, the inflation has taken a heavy toll on my potential earnings. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
