"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  Since the money depreciates more for Bob, I want to see if I can get away with taking almost everything!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to take more, this is a good deal for me.  Since I have no information about Bob's strategy, accepting this offer is the most logical choice to avoid losing more money in future rounds due to inflation."
