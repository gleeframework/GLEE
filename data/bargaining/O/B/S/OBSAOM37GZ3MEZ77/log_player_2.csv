"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. We both lose money as time goes on, and this split accounts for the faster rate of inflation affecting my share."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm proposing a more balanced offer considering the inflation hitting you harder. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the inflation disparity, her offer still heavily favors her. It's crucial to demonstrate I won't be easily swayed, especially as the pressure increases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking and we both lose with every round.  This offer is fair and gives us both a chance to gain something substantial. Let's be sensible."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this needs to be settled.  This is a slight improvement for me, and avoids further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation is hurting me far more than Alice. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer now ensures I at least receive something substantial before the value deteriorates further.  Refusing at this stage is getting too risky, as Alice knows the pressure is on me."
