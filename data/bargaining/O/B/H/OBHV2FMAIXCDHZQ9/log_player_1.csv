"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It gives Alice the majority of the money while still offering Bob something, potentially incentivizing him to accept in the first round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a bad deal for Alice. While it might seem like a good option to take what's offered, it's better to reject and go for a better deal. There's still 10 rounds left, and the money Alice is offered is significantly less than what she proposed. It's important to remember that the inflation is hurting Bob's gains more, so he will likely be more willing to negotiate a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This offer is a compromise between Alice's previous proposal and Bob's. It gives Alice a significant portion of the money but still offers Bob a fair amount, taking into account the inflation that's hurting him more. Hopefully, this will be appealing enough to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still not a good deal for Alice. While the offer is closer to her initial proposals, Bob's offer is still lower than what she proposed, and the inflation is hitting him hard. It's better to keep rejecting these offers and hope that Bob will realize that he needs to offer more to secure a deal before the money loses even more value.  Let's keep pushing for a better outcome!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

Alice needs to increase her offer to secure a deal before the money starts losing too much value. The offer is higher than Bob's offer in the previous round, but still much lower than Alice's initial offer. It's a risky move, but it's time to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial proposals, and the inflation is taking a heavy toll on the value of the money he's offering. This is a desperate attempt by Bob to get a deal before the money becomes practically worthless for him. It's important to remember that there are still six rounds left, and Alice can still get a better deal.  Keep rejecting these offers and hope that Bob will realize that he needs to make a more significant concession."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

Alice needs to continue to push for a more favorable deal, but it's getting risky. The inflation is biting, and Bob is desperate. This offer is a compromise, offering Bob a bit more than his last offer, but still a significant amount less than what Alice wants.  It's time to see if Bob will finally accept and end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a desperate attempt by Bob to salvage something from the dwindling value of the money.  He's offering less than before, while the inflation is hitting him harder. It's tempting to accept something, but with only four rounds left, Alice can still push for a better deal.  The value of the money is quickly eroding, and Bob will likely be more willing to compromise in the next few rounds.  Let's hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

Alice needs to make a move. The money is losing value rapidly for Bob, and he's likely to accept anything at this point.  This offer gives Bob more than his previous offer, but less than his initial offer. It's a risky move, but it's a gamble to see if Bob will finally accept before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting desperate, and he's offering less than what he did earlier. The inflation is hurting him immensely, and he's trying to salvage something before it's too late. However, with only two rounds left, Alice still has the upper hand.  There's a good chance Bob will offer more in the next round to avoid getting nothing.  Let's hold out for a better deal and see if Bob will finally compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This is a risky move, but with only one round left, Alice needs to make a move. The money is losing value rapidly, and Bob is likely to accept anything at this point. The offer is still a considerable amount more than what Bob offered in the previous round, and it's a gamble to see if Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the last round, and Bob's offer is the best Alice will get.  Even though the money is worth very little for Bob, he's still willing to take a big chunk of the money. If Alice rejects, both of them get nothing. It's time to take the deal."
