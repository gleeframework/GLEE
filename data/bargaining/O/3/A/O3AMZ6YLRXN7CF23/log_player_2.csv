Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. Let's be fair, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share.  I'm willing to compromise, but your offer wasn't realistic considering the inflation working against you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
