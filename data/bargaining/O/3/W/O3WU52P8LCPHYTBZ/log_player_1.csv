"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to think about whether it's still a good deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 40/60, I'll try to get a better split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, hoping Bob will accept this one."
