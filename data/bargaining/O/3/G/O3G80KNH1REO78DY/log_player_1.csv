"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the first chance to make an offer""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more fair. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of 40% for myself, especially since my initial offer was 60% and I think I'm worth more. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one who made the first offer""}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a better deal. I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 45%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be fair, a 50/50 split seems the most reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Considering the inflation and the fact that my initial offer was rejected, I think Bob's 50/50 split is a reasonable offer. I'm willing to accept it and end the game, as it's getting close to the deadline and I don't want to risk losing everything."
