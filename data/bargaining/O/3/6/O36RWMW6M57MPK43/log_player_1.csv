"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, I'm giving him a decent chunk of the money, but also keeping a significant amount for myself. The message is a friendly way of saying that I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not going to give away the entire sum without a fight!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'll try to counter 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting us!

I'll think carefully about Bob's counteroffer. Since the money is worth less now, I need to adjust my expectations. Considering the decrease in value, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
