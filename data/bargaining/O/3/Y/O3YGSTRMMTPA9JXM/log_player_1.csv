"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with the message ""Let's divide fairly"".\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept the offer or proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split considering the value of the money decreases for me each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, but 20% less to Bob, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round where I'll make a new proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you""}\n\nI am offering $7000 for myself and $3000 for Bob, with the message ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you"". Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'm taking that into account in my offer.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept the offer or proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's end this now, I'll take a slight loss, but it's better than waiting another round. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, but nearly 49% less to Bob, I believe I can negotiate for an even better split in the next round. The fact that Bob is willing to take a slight loss indicates that they are feeling the pressure of the inflation, so I'll try to capitalize on that in my next proposal.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round where I'll make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""You're losing value fast, let's settle""}\n\nI am offering $8000 for myself and $2000 for Bob, with the message ""You're losing value fast, let's settle"". Given the significant decrease in value for Bob, I'm pushing for a more favorable split, emphasizing the urgency for Bob to accept before the value drops even further.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept the offer or proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's decision."
