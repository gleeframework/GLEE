"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with 60-40""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I'm Alice, I will respond with a decision in JSON format:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because, considering the inflation, 50 dollars in the second round is worth less to me than it would have been in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is starting to hurt you more than me, so I'm willing to meet closer to the middle. This seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in future rounds. Meeting closer to the middle seems like a reasonable compromise."
