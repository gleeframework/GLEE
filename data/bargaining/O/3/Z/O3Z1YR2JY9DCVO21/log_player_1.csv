"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly higher share, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I feel it's still too skewed towards him. I was hoping for a more equal split, and this offer only gives me $4,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial proposal of $5,000. I'd like to make a new proposal and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but still want a fair share""}

I'm proposing a new offer, where I'll take $4,500 and Bob will take $5,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but still want to make sure I get a decent share of the money."
