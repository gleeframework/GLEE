I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation is hurting Alice more than me, so I want to see if I can push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic.  The money is losing value, and we're both losing out.  I think 70-30 is a good compromise that benefits us both.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the value is decreasing, but 56-44 is the lowest I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

The inflation is really starting to bite into Alice's share. I think 44 is a good return for me, considering how much I've pushed for a larger cut. Let's take the deal before it gets worse."
