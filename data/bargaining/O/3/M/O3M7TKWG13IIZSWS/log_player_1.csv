I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy here. I'm offering Bob the bare minimum, hoping he'll be so desperate to get anything that he'll accept it. However, if he rejects it, I know the money will be worth less to him in the next round, so he'll have even more incentive to accept my next offer."
