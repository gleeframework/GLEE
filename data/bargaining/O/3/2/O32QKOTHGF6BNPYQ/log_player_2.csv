"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to split the money fairly. Let's both get close to half. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money loses value over time, and Alice's offer is not exactly 50/50, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the money's devaluation, I think this split is more than fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. Inflation is impacting us both. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven that Alice is now offering a 50/50 split and considering the impact of inflation, which has already reduced the value of the money by 9.75% since the first round, accepting this offer seems to be the most reasonable decision to avoid further devaluation."
