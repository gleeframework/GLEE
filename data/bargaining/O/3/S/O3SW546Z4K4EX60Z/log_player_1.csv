"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20. I'll take the lower amount, you take the higher amount.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm also giving him a clear and simple proposal to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair and simple deal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 50% of the remaining money, considering the inflation. I want to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% this round, but I'll take 60% of the remaining amount next round.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency and make him consider accepting my offer before the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller portion this round, but I'll take the larger share next round. It's a compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less for me now, so I need to be more cautious.

However, considering the offer, I think I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to take 40% of the remaining amount this round, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation."
