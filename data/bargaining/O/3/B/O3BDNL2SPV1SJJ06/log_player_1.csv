"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This way, I'm giving him a decent chunk, but still keeping a majority of the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $5000 is actually worth $4000 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob an equal share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
