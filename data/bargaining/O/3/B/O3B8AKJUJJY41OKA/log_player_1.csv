"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60-40, which is a relatively fair split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair split, but I'm not getting any less than this! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so my gain would be 0.95 * 60 = 57.

Bob's gain of 50 is worth 80% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to 80% of 40, which is 32.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'm giving up a bit more than I would have in the first round. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and giving up even more.
