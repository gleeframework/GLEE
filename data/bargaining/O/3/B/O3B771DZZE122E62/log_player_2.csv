**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds go on and the value of the money decreases for her.  I'm going to hold out for a better offer, but I need to be mindful that if I push too hard, we both get nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 620000, ""alice_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm softening my stance slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. This offer gives Alice a bit more than her last, but still heavily favors me. It's a balance between maximizing my potential gain and ensuring we don't hit a stalemate."
