"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a decent amount of money, but still leave Bob with a significant share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move from Bob! Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll consider that in my decision.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
