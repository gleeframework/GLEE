"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept it since it's a 50-50 split, which is a better deal for me than my previous offer. Plus, Bob's message suggests he's willing to compromise, which is a good sign.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
