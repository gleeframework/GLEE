This is a tricky situation. While ideally I'd want a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. 

**Here's why:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob, making him more likely to accept a deal that's less favorable to him as time goes on. However, the inflation is also impacting my gains, even if at a slower rate.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in the next round. He might become even more desperate and offer an even smaller amount. 
* **Current Offer:**  52% of a shrinking pot is better than risking getting a smaller percentage in later rounds. 

By accepting now, I secure a reasonable amount, even if it's not the original 70% I aimed for."
