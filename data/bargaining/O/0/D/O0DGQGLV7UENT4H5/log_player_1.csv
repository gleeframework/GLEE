"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion, hoping he'll be more willing to accept early on and avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. While I'd prefer to get more, the risk of further rounds and potential inflation isn't worth it.  I'm happy to take 70% of the money and get the game over."
