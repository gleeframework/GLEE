"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective value of the money is decreasing, so I'd better take what I can get. I'll accept this offer.
