"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky this time, but I'll get the better deal eventually! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'd rather not give up $8,000, especially with the inflation affecting Bob's gains.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering Bob's aggressive move in Round 2, I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $5,500 and leaving $4,500 for Bob. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, and we can finally reach an agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

However, considering the significant inflation effect on Bob's gains, I think I can do better than this offer. $6,000 for Bob is equivalent to $4,800 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the inflation and Bob's aggressive moves, I'll try to be more cautious and aim for a slightly more favorable split. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call a truce, 50-50 seems fair!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will see the sense in it and agree to a more balanced division."
