"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I still want to get a decent share. However, I think I can do better than 2000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still not too extreme. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to compromise, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be more cautious with my decisions. However, 3000 is a relatively small amount for me, and I don't want to risk getting even less in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, and we can wrap up the game."
