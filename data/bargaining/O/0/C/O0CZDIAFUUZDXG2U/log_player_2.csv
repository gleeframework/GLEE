"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we take a 60/40 split to ensure we both benefit. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have nothing to lose by waiting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nSince the money loses value for Alice, I'll try to make an offer that takes that into account. I'll offer a slightly uneven split in my favor, but still reasonable.\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split. What do you think, Alice?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn. Considering the time pressure and that the value decreases for me each round, I propose 55/45.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI'll reject this offer since it's less favorable to me than my previous offer, which was also 55/45 but in my favor. I have no incentive to accept a worse deal, especially since the money doesn't lose value for me. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nSince Alice is under more pressure due to the inflation and her previous offer was 55/45 in her favor, I'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than my previous one. I'll take into account that the money is losing value for her but not for me.\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the increasing time pressure and the fact that the money is worth less to you with each passing round, I think a 58/42 split is a reasonable compromise. Let's settle this.""}"
