I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, recognizing that Bob will be taking a larger hit from inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation.  I'm still taking the larger share, but I'm increasing Bob's share to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000

``` 

Bob's offer is still too low, and his share has increased significantly.  I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000} 
```

Despite the significant inflation, I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm further increasing Bob's portion to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While the money is worth significantly less now, this offer at least offers a decent amount, and it's a far better deal than the 50/50 split I'd get if we go to the next round."
