"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal considering the depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering you a more balanced split, considering the inflation will affect us both. Let's be fair and move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! Let's settle this with a win-win before inflation eats away at our gains even more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a better deal for me than the previous round, and considering inflation, it's likely I won't get a better offer from Alice."
