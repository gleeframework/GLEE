"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can negotiate from here to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise, and I'd like to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
