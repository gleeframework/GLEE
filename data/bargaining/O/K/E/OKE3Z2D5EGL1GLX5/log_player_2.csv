"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, I think it's a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next! I'm not satisfied with 40% of the money. I think I can get a better deal. Please proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hurting both of us, so I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think a 50/50 split is a fair deal, considering the inflation and the fact that Alice is also losing value. It's better to secure 5000 dollars now rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds."
