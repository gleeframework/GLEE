Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very uneven split.  I figure Bob might be willing to take a small amount now and avoid the risk of getting nothing in future rounds.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's likely that Bob will continue to propose a 50/50 split in future rounds.  With inflation eroding the value of my share, accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my earnings."
