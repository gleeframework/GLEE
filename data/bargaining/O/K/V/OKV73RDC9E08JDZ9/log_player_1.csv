Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to take such a big loss.  Let's split the difference again.  I'll take 40, and you take 60.

This is a tough one! On the one hand, it's the same offer as Round 1, and we could try to push for more. However, Bob is experiencing significant inflation. Accepting now guarantees us a good share, whereas holding out risks him making even less appealing offers in desperation."
