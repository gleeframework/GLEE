60.0,40.0,Let's make a deal! I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's a fair starting point considering the time pressure and inflation working against us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can adjust later if needed.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, time is ticking, and that means my share is effectively shrinking. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's closer to your offer, but acknowledges the time pressure.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit, but 55/45 in my favor is the most I can offer considering the inflation impacting you. We need to be fair to both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 52/48 split. It's a compromise that acknowledges the time pressure on me while still giving you a larger share than my previous offer.  Let's be reasonable and end this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
