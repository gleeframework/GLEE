Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and divide the money in a way that reflects the inflation penalty we both face. Since my penalty is lower, I'll take a bit more. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's better than risking further devaluation.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but I think we can both get a bit more if we negotiate.  Let's split the money closer to 55/45, acknowledging the difference in inflation but giving us both a better outcome. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000,
