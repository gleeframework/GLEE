"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide the money in a way that reflects the inflation penalty we both face. Since my penalty is lower, I'll take a bit more. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's better than risking further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but I think we can both get a bit more if we negotiate.  Let's split the money closer to 55/45, acknowledging the difference in inflation but giving us both a better outcome.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to negotiate, which is great. However, given the inflation rates, I believe my initial offer was more than fair. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still think I should get a larger share to compensate for the lower devaluation on my end. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000
