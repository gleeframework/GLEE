"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, you can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small portion of the money to get the game started, and I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, each receiving $500,000. This ensures fairness and avoids potential inflation issues. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable one. I'd rather not risk waiting for a potentially worse offer and accept the even split.
