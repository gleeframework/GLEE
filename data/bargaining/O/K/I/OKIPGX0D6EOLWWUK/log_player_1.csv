Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  I'm banking on him not being aware of the inflation factor.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even with the inflation, getting $5000 is better than risking getting nothing if I reject and Bob offers me less in the next round.  Let's accept!"
