"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess as we go along.""
}
```

This offer splits the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us receiving $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm thinking I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiation! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, his offer of $7,500 is actually equivalent to $6,750 in the first round. Considering the risk of negotiation, I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I'd like to try to get a bit more.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
