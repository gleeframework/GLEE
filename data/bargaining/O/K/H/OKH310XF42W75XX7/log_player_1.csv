"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering to give Bob half of the money, which is a fair and equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a bit skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer in the hopes of getting a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's money is worth 30% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher amount than before, but still trying to get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! Given the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be more aggressive in my decision-making. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed in his favor, but it's not a bad deal considering the circumstances.
