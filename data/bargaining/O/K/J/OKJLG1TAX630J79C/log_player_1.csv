"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money 3:2 in my favor. This is fair given the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 7:3 is a more balanced ratio considering the inflation risk. It's still a fair split, but with a bit more for me to compensate for the risk of Alice's offer being too generous. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
