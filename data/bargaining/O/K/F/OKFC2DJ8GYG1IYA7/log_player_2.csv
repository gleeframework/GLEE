**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a 50/50 split, but the inflation is eating into the overall value significantly. It's worth holding out a little longer to see if I can secure a slightly better deal.  The potential losses from another round of inflation are less impactful than accepting a deal significantly below my target."
