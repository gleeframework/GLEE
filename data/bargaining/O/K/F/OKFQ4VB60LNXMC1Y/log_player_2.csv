Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a good share. Let's split it 60/40. If you reject this, we'll be losing money fast! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The rate of inflation is hurting her faster than me. I need to push for a more significant shift in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. 55/45 is my final offer.  Take it, or let's risk both losing even more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my stake significantly to push Alice towards a deal. My offer is still a majority, but the rapidly decreasing value of the money makes it risky to be too greedy. The ""final offer"" language adds pressure."
