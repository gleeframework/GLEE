Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn for a starting offer. Let's be realistic, time is money.  65/35 split, take it or let's see where we are next round. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not happy with this offer, especially since it's my turn to propose next. I need to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a good share. Let's split it 60/40. If you reject this, we'll be losing money fast!""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. 55/45 is my final offer.  Take it, or let's risk both losing even more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Although it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The inflation is hitting hard, and rejecting could lead to a much worse outcome for both of us."
