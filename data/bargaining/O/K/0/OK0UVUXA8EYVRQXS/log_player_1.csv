Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I am taking a larger share but still allowing Bob to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose to take $800,000 and give Bob $200,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, acknowledging that we both need to be more flexible with the declining value of the money."
