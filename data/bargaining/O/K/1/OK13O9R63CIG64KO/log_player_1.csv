Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you $4000 to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, hoping to get him to accept the offer quickly."

# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I think I deserve a slight edge. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of the original amount. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation. I'll reject his offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a larger share to account for the inflation. Let's see if you agree.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2500, which is a smaller portion of the total, but I'm hoping to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's enough to compensate for the inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gain. With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original, I need to be cautious. Bob's offer of $3000 is a relatively small share, but considering the decreasing value of money, it's not a bad option.

However, I'm not sure if it's enough to compensate for the inflation. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. I need a bigger share to make up for the inflation. Will you reconsider?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1500, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gain. With the money being worth 67.23% less than the original, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer of $2000 is a very small share, but I'm not sure if I have a better option.

}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not a great deal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
