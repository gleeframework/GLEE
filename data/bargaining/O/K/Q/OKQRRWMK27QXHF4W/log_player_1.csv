"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual values are:

* Alice gets $40 × (1 - 0.20) = $32
* Bob gets $60 × (1 - 0.20) = $48

Considering the reduced values, I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
