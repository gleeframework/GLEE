"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the upcoming inflation.  Let's be realistic. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split considering the inflation""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the decreased value of money and trying to find a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  A 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation we're both facing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the inflation and the previous rejections. Meeting in the middle at 55/45 seems like a reasonable split, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation."
