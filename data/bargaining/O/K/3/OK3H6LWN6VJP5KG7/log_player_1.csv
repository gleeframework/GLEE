 I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything.  Since there's inflation, I figure I need to get as much as possible in the first round.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to get more, I know the inflation is going to make things worse for me in the long run.  Taking 1000 is better than risking getting nothing in the next round.  I'll accept!"
