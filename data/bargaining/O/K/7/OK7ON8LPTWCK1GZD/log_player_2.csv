Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and it's losing value fast! I'm coming down a bit to $5,700, but let's close this deal now before inflation eats away at our gains further. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700

{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some reluctance here.  I'm dropping my offer to $5,400.  Let's be practical, every round costs us both.  Agree now and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are getting more reasonable. However, I believe holding out a little longer could push her closer to a more even split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing faster for her."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, the tables are turning. Inflation is hitting you harder, and I'm willing to offer a slight majority to close this out. Take this deal before it gets even worse for you.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, the tables are turning. But I'm still willing to take a hit from my initial offer.  $5,100 is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Alice is digging in, and while she's willing to take a hit, she's still holding out for a slight majority.  With each round, the potential gains shrink for both of us. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share, whereas pushing further risks getting even less if Alice becomes more stubborn."
