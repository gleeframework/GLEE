"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I propose that I take $9,000, and Bob gets $1,000.  I want to maximize my share in the first round, while still leaving something for Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I will not give in.  I'll reject and make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm going to adjust my offer to account for the inflation. I'll take $7,200, leaving $2,800 for Bob. This keeps a sizable share for me while offering Bob a decent increase from the previous round. Hopefully, this will incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is pushing harder, but I'm still not convinced. I'm going to reject his offer and continue to fight for a fairer deal.  The inflation is hitting me harder, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240} 
```

I'm making another slight adjustment to account for the inflation. This time, I'll take $5,760, leaving $4,240 for Bob. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still a better deal for me than Bob's offer. I hope this is enough to convince him to accept."
