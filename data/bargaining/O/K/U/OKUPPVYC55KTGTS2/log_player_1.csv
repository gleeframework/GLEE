"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount of $1,000, while I'll take the majority of $9,000. The message is a straightforward one - take it or leave it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more generous offer from Bob this time!

I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Splitting it evenly seems fair, and I'll take $5,000."
