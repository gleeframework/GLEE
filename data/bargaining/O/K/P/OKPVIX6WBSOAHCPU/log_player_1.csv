"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leaving Bob with $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I need to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 70% of 80% of $100 = 0.7 * 0.8 * $100 = $56
* Bob's gain: 30% of 80% of $100 = 0.3 * 0.8 * $100 = $24

I'll reject this offer, since I can get more than $56 in future rounds.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. My goal is to get as much as possible.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the current value of the money, which is $40, and leaving Bob with $10."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth 51.2% of its original value due to inflation. Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 75% of 51.2% of $100 = 0.75 * 0.512 * $100 = $38.88
* Bob's gain: 25% of 51.2% of $100 = 0.25 * 0.512 * $100 = $12.80

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than what I could get in future rounds.
