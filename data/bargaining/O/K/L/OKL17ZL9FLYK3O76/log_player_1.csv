"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll think carefully... Since the money is worth less now, I'd rather take the higher amount now and not risk waiting for a better offer later. I'll accept Bob's offer.
