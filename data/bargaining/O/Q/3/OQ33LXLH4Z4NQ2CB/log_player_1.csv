"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a nearly even split, giving Bob a small amount just to avoid conflict in the first round. I want to ensure that we don't run out of time, but also show that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's frustrating that Bob rejected my initial offer, accepting his 50/50 split is the best option at this point.  The inflation is going to make each round more difficult, and a guaranteed 500,000 is better than risking a smaller payout later."
