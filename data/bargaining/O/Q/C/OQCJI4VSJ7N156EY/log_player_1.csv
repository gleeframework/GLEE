Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll be greedy and want to make a counter-offer in the next round.  This way I might be able to get a slightly better deal later, even with the 5% inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation risk is too high. It's better to secure a 50/50 split now than risk getting less in the next round."
