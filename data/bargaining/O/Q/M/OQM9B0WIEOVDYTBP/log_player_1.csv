"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I take 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob takes 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 3/5, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since I'll be getting 4000, which is 40% of the current value of the money (10,000 * 0.8 = 8000), I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, where I take 55% of the current value of the money (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 6400) and Bob takes 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the current value of the money (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.952 = 6144), I'll get 5000, which is about 81% of the current value. Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which would give me 5000 as well.

I think this is a decent offer, considering the circumstances. I'll decide to...
