"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'd like to get a better deal, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and having the money worth even less due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, and Bob's offer in round 2 was already a 50-50 split, so I'll try to get a better deal.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a 55.5-44.5 split, trying to squeeze a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a better deal now that the money is worth less.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is actually a good one. It's a 45-55 split, which is slightly more favorable to Bob, but the reduced value of the money makes it a more reasonable offer.
