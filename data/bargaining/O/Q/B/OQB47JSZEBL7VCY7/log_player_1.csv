"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, my gain of 49 is actually $49 x 0.95 = $46.55.

I'm not thrilled with the 49/51 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
