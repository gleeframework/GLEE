"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep 900,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This way, I secure the majority of the money while still offering Bob a small share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'm not going to accept this offer, especially with my money losing value at a faster rate than his. I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 300,000 dollars, which is more than he got in the last round, even with the inflation.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still significantly less than what I initially wanted, the inflation is making the money less and less valuable.  It's better to take 300,000 now than risk getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting offers."
