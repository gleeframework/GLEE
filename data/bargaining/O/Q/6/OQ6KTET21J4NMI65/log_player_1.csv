"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting with a more aggressive offer. Your turn to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive!

I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $20 is actually worth $19.

I'm not sure if I want to accept such a lopsided split, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's gain. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's split it 50/50.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining $100. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a more balanced split and be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too cautious, Alice. I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another aggressive offer from Bob!

Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $30 is worth $25.65 (100 - 14.26% = 85.74% of the original value)
Bob's gain of $70 is worth $36.80 (100 - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm also not sure if I want to push Bob too hard. I'll reject this offer and try to find a middle ground.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a bit more than 30% this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still not as aggressive as my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a more balanced split and be willing to accept it."
