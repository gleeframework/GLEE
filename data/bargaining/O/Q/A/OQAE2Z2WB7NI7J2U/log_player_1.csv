"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering future losses""}\n\nThe reasoning behind this offer is that Alice takes into account the impact of inflation on Bob's future gains. Given that the money loses 20% of its value for Bob with each passing round, Alice proposes a division that slightly favors herself but remains relatively fair and enticing enough for Bob to consider accepting early on. This approach aims to balance the immediate value for both parties while factoring in the diminishing value for Bob over time. By suggesting a 60-40 split, Alice is attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges Bob's potential future losses without significantly undercutting her own gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money every round, so a fair split is best for us both. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nThe reasoning behind this decision is that, despite Bob's suggestion of an even split being intuitively fair, it doesn't account for the asymmetric impact of inflation on their gains. Since Alice's gains are not affected by inflation, and Bob's gains are worth 20% less with each round, an even split at this stage doesn't reflect the true value they both stand to gain. By rejecting this offer, Alice aims to negotiate a split that considers the decreasing value of Bob's share over time, potentially securing a more favorable outcome in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering your loss, this is more than fair""}\n\nThe reasoning behind this offer is that Alice continues to factor in the impact of inflation on Bob's share. Given that Bob's money is now worth 20% less than in the first round and will continue to decrease, Alice adjusts her offer to reflect this change while still aiming to entice Bob into accepting. By slightly increasing Bob's share from her initial offer but not going as far as an even split, Alice is trying to find a balance that acknowledges Bob's losses without compromising her own gains significantly. This approach maintains pressure on Bob to consider accepting, as further rounds will only diminish his share's value."
