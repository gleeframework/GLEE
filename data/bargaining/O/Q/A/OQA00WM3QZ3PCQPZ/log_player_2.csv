Let's see what Alice offers next!  I'm not happy with 40, let's try to get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this round, but I'm sure you can see this is a fair deal for both of us.  Let's get this done!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable compromise 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept.  Although I'm getting less than I offered in the previous round, the inflation is making Alice's offer more appealing."
