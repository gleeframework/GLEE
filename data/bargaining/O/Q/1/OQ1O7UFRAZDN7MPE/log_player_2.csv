Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, $10,000 is now equivalent to $8,000 in value to me. I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, so $10,000 is now equivalent to $6,400 in value to me. Alice's offer is:

# Bob gain: 4800
# Alice gain: 5200

Since 4800 is greater than 4000 (my offer in round 2), I'll accept this offer.
