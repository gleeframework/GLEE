"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me already!

Considering the new offer, I think I'll have to be more aggressive to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd like to make a new proposal that will give me a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is making the money worth even less!

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, trying to get a better deal in this inflationary environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not backing down from my previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the new offer, I think I'll have to take a closer look at the numbers. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my expectations. In this case, I think I'll accept Bob's offer to meet in the middle:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $5,000 and call it a day."
