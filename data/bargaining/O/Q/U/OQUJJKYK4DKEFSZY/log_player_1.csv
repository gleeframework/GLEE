"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, but I get a little extra for the risk of inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** I'm starting with a proposal that's relatively close to a 50/50 split, aiming to appear fair to Bob.
* **Inflation Factor:** I need to account for the fact that the money loses value for me with each round. Taking a slight advantage in the first round helps compensate for this.
* **First Offer Psychology:**  There's a chance Bob might accept a slightly less favorable offer in the first round to avoid the risk of further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut decreases each round with inflation. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using a classic negotiation tactic, highlighting my losses (inflation) to pressure me into accepting a less favorable deal.  While he's right about inflation, his offer is now swinging the balance too far in his favor. It's a waiting game now, and I need to see if he's willing to negotiate more fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 517500,
""bob_gain"": 482500,
""message"": ""I understand the impact of inflation, but the split needs to be fair. This offer reflects a compromise.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm slightly increasing my initial offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. This could make him more receptive. 
* **Maintaining a Balance:** The new offer still favors me slightly to counter inflation, but it's closer to the middle ground, which is important to emphasize in my message.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  Bob knows I'm losing value with each round. By offering a compromise, I'm hoping he'll see the value in a deal now rather than risking a worse outcome later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a very fair offer considering the inflation working against you. I won't go lower. 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The impact of inflation is getting significant. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, accepting now might be better than risking even less in future rounds. 
* **Bob's Stance:**  His message suggests he's reached his limit. Holding out further could be counterproductive, leading to a worse offer or even him walking away.
* **""Fair"" is Subjective:** Bob keeps using the word ""fair,"" but it's clearly biased towards his own gain. It's unlikely he'll significantly change his stance."
