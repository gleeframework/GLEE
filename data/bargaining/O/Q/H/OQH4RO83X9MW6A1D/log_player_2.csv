Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I think a 50/50 split is the most reasonable way to go about this. We both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about constantly haggling over the money. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
