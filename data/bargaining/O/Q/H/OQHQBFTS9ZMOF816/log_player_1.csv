"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to negotiate further to get a larger share."

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my desired share, while still leaving room for Bob to get a decent amount."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
