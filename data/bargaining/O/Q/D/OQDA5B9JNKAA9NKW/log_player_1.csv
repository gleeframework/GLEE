"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I want to see how Bob reacts and if he's willing to risk going to the next round. Since the money inflates with each round, it's better to take a small amount now than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's a significantly lower offer than my initial proposal, it's still better than nothing. With the inflation factor, I risk getting even less in the following rounds. It's best to secure something now rather than gamble on a better offer."
