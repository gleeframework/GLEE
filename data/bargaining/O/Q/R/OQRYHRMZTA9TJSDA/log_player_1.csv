"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, Alice. Let's call it a draw. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob gets 60% of the money, while I only get 40%. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'd like to make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's try again, Bob! I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
