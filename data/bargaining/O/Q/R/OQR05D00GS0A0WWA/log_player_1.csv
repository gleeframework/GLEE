"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the funds with a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 75% ($7,500) and you'll receive the remaining 25% ($2,500). This proposal aims for fairness while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer a 50/50 split, as the value of money is decreasing rapidly. This way, we both get an equal share and can negotiate again in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
