Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's not a fair deal, Alice. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It benefits us both to agree now before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
