"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a pretty lopsided split, and while I don't know how much inflation is affecting Alice, I'm sure I can get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer a much more balanced split. I'm confident this will be a fair deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it's still not an ideal split, given the inflation and the fact that I'll need to be the one proposing next time, I think it's best to accept this offer.  I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
