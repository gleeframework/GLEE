"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can see if Bob is interested in accepting this straightforward proposal or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
