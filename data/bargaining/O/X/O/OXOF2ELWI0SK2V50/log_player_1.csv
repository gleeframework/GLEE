"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'll get 80%!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

I accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 6000$. It's not the best deal, but it's a fair start, and I'm hoping we can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
