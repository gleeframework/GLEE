"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. This offer is better for you than what'll come next.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:** Alice loses value faster (20% per round) than Bob (5%).  Bob needs to capitalize on her shrinking pot. 
* **Appearing Reasonable (Slightly):** Offering slightly more than half might seem ""fair"" at first glance, increasing the chance Alice accepts. 
* **Implying Future Losses:** The message hints that if Alice rejects, the next offer will be less favorable to her, making her consider accepting now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is hurting:**  The 36% inflation hit to Alice's potential earnings is HUGE. This means she's feeling significant pressure to make a deal soon.
* **Bob is still in a good spot:**  A 9.75% loss is not insignificant, but it's manageable, especially knowing Alice is in a much weaker position.
* **Holding out for a better deal:** Bob can likely squeeze out a more favorable offer in the next round while Alice gets increasingly desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Take it before it's too late.  This is your last chance for anything close to this amount.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  This offer heavily favors Bob, but the message is designed to make Alice panic.  She's facing another 20% value loss if she rejects.
* **The ""Last Chance"" Tactic:**  By framing this as her final opportunity for a reasonable sum, Bob aims to exploit the psychological pressure Alice is under.
* **Bob's Risk:** There's a chance Alice calls Bob's bluff, but her rapidly shrinking potential gains make it increasingly risky for her to reject."
