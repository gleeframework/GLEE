"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,

This offer attempts to seem reasonable while still giving Alice a significant advantage. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice.  Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is even worse for me now! I need to try to take control of the situation before inflation eats away at my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be realistic.  My turn, my rules. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Appear Firm:** The message aims to make Bob think this is my last offer, pushing him to accept. 
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my share slightly to make it seem like I'm compromising.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases for me, so I need to apply pressure.

Let's see if Bob takes the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice, but I need a bit more than 45$.  How about we split it 55/45? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is getting ridiculous! Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold strong and hope he panics as the rounds dwindle down."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alright Bob, you win. Let's just split it down the middle and be done with this.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Appearing to Concede:**  Bob is being incredibly stubborn. Offering a 50/50 split makes it seem like I'm giving in, which might make him more likely to accept. 
* **Cutting Losses:** Inflation is eating into my potential gains. While not ideal, a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds.

It's frustrating, but sometimes you need to pick your battles."
