I'm proposing to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm proposing a more even split this time, with me taking $5,500 and Bob taking $4,500.  I think this is a fair offer, as it gives Bob a significant portion of the money while also ensuring that I receive a good share as well."
