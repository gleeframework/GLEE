"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $1,000,000 and the message I'd like to pass to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly considering the inflation impact.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob, considering that with each passing round, the value of money decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. This seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This factors in the inflation disadvantage slightly more in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $1,000,000 and the message I'd like to pass to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, this is a more balanced offer.""
}
```

Given that the value of money continues to decrease, I've adjusted my offer to take slightly less than before, but still aiming for a larger share due to Bob's greater inflation disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is my final offer, let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
