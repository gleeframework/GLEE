"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, he should be motivated to accept this offer rather than risking a lower value in the next round. Meanwhile, I'll take $60, which is a reasonable amount considering the lower inflation rate for me.\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly. It's a better deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation rates, I can potentially get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, he will be more motivated to accept a lower offer as the rounds progress. Meanwhile, the 5% decrease in value for me is relatively manageable, so I'm willing to take the risk and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\nI'm making a more conservative offer this time, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since Bob's offer of 40-60 was rejected, I'm trying to find a middle ground that would be more acceptable to him, while also considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money. By offering 55-45, I'm hoping to entice Bob to accept, as the value of the money will continue to decrease for him at a higher rate than for me. Your turn, Bob!"
