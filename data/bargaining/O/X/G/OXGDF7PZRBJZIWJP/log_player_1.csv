"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain would be 40, which is 20% less than the 50 I would have gotten in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if I want to give him a 60% share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain will be 32 (40 * 0.8, since it's 20% less than the previous round).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I still want to keep some for myself. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain would be 28 * 0.516 (since it's 48.8% less than the first round), which is approximately 14.46.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a 72% share, but I'm getting desperate too. I'll accept this offer to avoid getting nothing.
