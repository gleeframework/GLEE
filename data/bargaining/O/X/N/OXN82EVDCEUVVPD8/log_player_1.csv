I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point given the inflation disadvantage I will face in the next round."

I propose a 50/50 split.  While I would prefer more, the inflation is hurting us both significantly. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get a reasonable share."

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but the inflation is significantly affecting me. I will reject this offer and see if we can come to a more balanced agreement in the next round."

I propose a 52/48 split in my favor. While the inflation has been substantial, I believe this is a fair offer given the previous rounds and the continuing disadvantage I face. I am willing to compromise to reach a solution."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share, Bob's offer is the closest we've gotten to a 50/50 split.  Accepting this offer will secure a larger share for me than any previous offers.  It's time to end this game and move on."
