"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share, but it's still a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. While I don't want to give up the majority of the money, I also don't want to risk waiting for a better offer and running out of time. Considering the inflation, I think I'll accept this offer.
