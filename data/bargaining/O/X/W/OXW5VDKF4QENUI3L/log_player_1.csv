I'm going to offer Bob a 40/60 split. This is a reasonable starting point that I think gives Bob a fair share, while still leaving me with a comfortable majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Although the inflation has devalued the money, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself. I'm willing to wait and see what Bob's next offer will be."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 55/45.  Bob rejected my previous offer, and I want to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a larger share."
