Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a 50-50 split. I'm not sure if I want to give up my advantage, but I also don't want to risk going to another round. Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I'll...
