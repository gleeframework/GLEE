Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  It reflects the devaluation over time, but still gives us a good chunk. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
