Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"

# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll, I need to be more cautious. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.
