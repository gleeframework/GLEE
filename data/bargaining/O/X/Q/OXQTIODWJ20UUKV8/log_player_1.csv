"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor, and see if you like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, so I need to be careful!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30-70 split, and I think I can do better. The money is worth less, but I'm still looking for a more equitable share. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than 30%. Let's see if you'll meet me halfway.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which I think is a more reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not thrilled with the 35-65 split, especially considering the rapid inflation. I think I can do better, and I'm not willing to settle for this offer just yet. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
