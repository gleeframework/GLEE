"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 3800 (95% of 4000) in the current round.

I'll reject the offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to be generous forever""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 1, the money was worth 100%, in round 2 it was 95%, in round 3 it was 95% of 95% = 90.25%, and in round 4 it's 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of the original value.

So, my gain of 3500 in round 4 is actually worth 3500 * 0.8574 = 3002.1.

I'll reject the offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
