"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a fair share considering the initial amount. If he accepts, I'll get $900,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share now, or risk losing even more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```

```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
