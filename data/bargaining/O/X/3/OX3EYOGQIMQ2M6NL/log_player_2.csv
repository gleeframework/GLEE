"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! This offer leaves us both with a good amount. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a higher amount to compensate for the loss in value.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round where I'll make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'm losing value each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. My last offer was generous, but I'm willing to compromise. This deal still gives you a decent share, and remember, it loses value for you with every round. Time is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, although the money is losing value for me with each round, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Alice's offer has increased by $5 from the previous round, but I'm aiming for a more significant share to offset the loss in value due to inflation. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let me make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this time since I've lost 19% of the value already. I think this is still a reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting serious! I'm lowering my demand again to be fair, but we need to close this soon. You're losing money with every 'no'! What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer has improved, and I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, I'm going to reject this offer. Since we're only halfway through the rounds, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to propose a better deal in the next round to maximize my gain.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round where I'll make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I've lost over a third of the value, so I need a bigger share. This is my most generous offer yet, considering my losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! I'm making another compromise here, but I can't go much lower. You're losing serious money with each passing round. Let's be smart and get this deal done! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm going to accept this offer. Although the money is worth significantly less for me due to inflation, and I've been pushing for a better deal, Alice's offer has improved over the rounds. Considering we're more than halfway through and the value of the money for me is decreasing rapidly, I think it's wise to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in the subsequent rounds.\n\nLet's finalize the deal based on Alice's current proposal.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
