# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm confident I can do better. I'll take the risk of another round and see if I can get a bigger share."

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I see you're playing hardball. Let's be realistic, though.  I'm willing to give you a bigger cut this time, but I still need the majority.  Accept this and we can move on.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's split it 45/55.  We can both walk away with a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still confident I can get a better deal. While Bob's offer is more generous than his previous one, I'm not willing to settle for less than 60% at this point."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time.  Inflation is hitting you harder than me, and we're both losing money with each round.  Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a larger share than before, but I still need the majority to make it worth my while.  Accept this and let's end this game.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting closer, Alice. I'm willing to accept a 35/65 split.  This is a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid losing more money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is reasonable given the decreasing value of the money for him. It's a significant gain for me, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round."
