I'm taking most of the money. It's a risky strategy, but I think Bob might accept it just to avoid risking getting nothing if the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a much fairer offer than the one I made, and the money is rapidly losing value. Accepting this deal guarantees me a significant share, and  I don't want to risk getting nothing if we keep playing."
