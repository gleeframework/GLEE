"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're not satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. So, it's actually equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to settle for a 50/50 split, considering I could potentially negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% of the original amount). So, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreased purchasing power.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like a slightly higher share to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher share to account for inflation, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4800 is now worth 55.4% of what it was in the first round (100% - 44.6% = 55.4%). I'm still not satisfied with the offer, as I think I can get a better deal.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.
