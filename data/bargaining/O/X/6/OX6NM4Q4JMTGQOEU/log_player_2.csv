Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this soon! I'm acknowledging the inflation difference by offering you more than your last offer. Let's be practical and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the inflation, her offer is still not advantageous enough for me.  I need to signal I'm willing to push this further, but I also need to start being more aggressive to account for the rapidly devaluing money."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and our potential gains are shrinking fast.  I'm proposing a split that reflects the reality of the situation: I'm less affected by the inflation, so I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With each round, the value diminishes significantly, especially for Alice. It's crucial to apply pressure and highlight the urgency.
* **Inflation disparity:** Emphasizing that Bob is less impacted by inflation reinforces his bargaining power.  
* **Bold move:** This offer, while leaning heavily in Bob's favor, might be the wake-up call Alice needs to realize that further stalling heavily favors Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While a strong offer, it leaves space for a counter-proposal in case Alice is willing to negotiate further before the value diminishes even more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of our stubbornness. I'm proposing a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it, but we're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, this is getting ridiculous. While the even split isn't ideal, consider these factors:

* **Severe devaluation:**  The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting any longer will result in significantly diminished returns, even if I manage to secure a slightly larger share in a later round.
* **Alice's stance:** Her ""take it or leave it"" message suggests she's unlikely to accept anything less than an even split at this point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better offer carries the very real risk of ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement in time.  

It's time to cut my losses and accept the guaranteed, albeit smaller, gain."
