"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he's happy with it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my original offer, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering a significant portion to Bob to incentivize him to accept. With each round, the money is worth less, so I need to find a balance between being fair and securing a deal before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my previous offer, and the inflation is hurting him much more than me. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share to Bob, hoping to find a middle ground. We're both losing value with each round, so I need to be firm but also willing to compromise to reach a deal before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is improving from his previous rounds, it is still not as good as my previous offer. The inflation is hitting him hard, but I am confident that we can still find a solution that benefits us both. I will continue to negotiate in the hopes of reaching a fair agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. The inflation is becoming a serious issue for both of us, and I believe this is the fairest and most likely way to reach an agreement before we both lose too much."
