"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This way, we can both walk away with a significant amount of money and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but we can still come to a fair agreement.  Let's see if we can get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I'm not willing to accept a 50.5/49.5 split, as it's not a significant enough difference to justify the risk of further inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50.5/49.5 split, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my share. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering a 48/52 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split, but still slightly skewed in my favor."
