"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more equitable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I'd like to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too low, I'll try to do better""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split just yet, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55:45 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50:50 split, but still gives me a slight edge."
