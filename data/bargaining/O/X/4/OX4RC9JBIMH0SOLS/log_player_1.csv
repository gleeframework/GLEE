I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm still leaving Bob with something. Let's see if he's willing to accept it in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a 50/50 split, the inflation has significantly devalued my potential earnings from the previous round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, as I'll be the one making the offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for the inflation and Bob's possible perception of fairness. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to him than the 50/50 split he proposed."

I'm going for a more even split now. The inflation is hitting me hard, and I need to be more realistic with my expectations. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept before the inflation completely erodes my potential earnings."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
