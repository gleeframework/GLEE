"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'll take 90% of the money and leave 10% for Bob.  It's a fair offer considering the risk of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  The inflation has significantly decreased the value of my share, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round. It's better to secure 200,000 now than risk losing everything."
