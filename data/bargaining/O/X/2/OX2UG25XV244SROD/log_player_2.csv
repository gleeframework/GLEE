# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if Alice will be more willing to negotiate in the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fairer. This way we both get a good share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try for a 50/50 split this time. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and with the inflation, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all!"
