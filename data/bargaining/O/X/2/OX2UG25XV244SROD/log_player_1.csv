"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a good chunk of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. This way we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best one yet. I was hoping for a slightly more generous offer from him.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try for a 50/50 split this time.""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with each of us getting $50. I think this is a fair compromise, and it's a good middle ground to aim for."
