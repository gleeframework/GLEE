"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 7-3 split, a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that!

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not give up 3/4 of the remaining money so early in the game. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
