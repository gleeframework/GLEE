"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer seems reasonable in round 1.  Since the money is worth less to Bob, it's fair to give him a smaller amount.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking a further round. Bob is getting a bigger share and the value of the money is decreasing for him at a faster rate. Accepting seems like the best strategy here."
