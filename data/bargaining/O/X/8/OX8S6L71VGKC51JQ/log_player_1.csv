"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that suggests I'm trying to be somewhat fair but also taking a bit more for myself. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly.  I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""
}
```

I've taken into account the previous offers and tried to find a middle ground. Since the money is worth 10% less with each passing round, I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer rather than risking further devaluation. Your turn!"
