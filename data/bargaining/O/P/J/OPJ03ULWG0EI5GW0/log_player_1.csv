Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you proposed an unfair split in the previous round, I'm proposing a split that is fair to me, but still recognizes the impact of inflation on your share. Let's make this quick and equitable. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250
