Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Since you proposed an unfair split in the previous round, I'm proposing a split that is fair to me, but still recognizes the impact of inflation on your share. Let's make this quick and equitable.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  Let's stop wasting time with unfair offers and split the money equally. This is the most logical solution considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
