Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but still give you a decent share 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's not terrible, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The money is worth more to me than Alice, so I have some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's fair and we both get a good amount.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still give you a decent chunk. You can't expect me to give you half 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting again.  While the offer is better than the previous round, I believe I can still get a better deal. The inflation is hitting Alice harder, so I'm going to try to push for more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'll take a slightly bigger share, but you'll still get a good amount.  We need to reach an agreement before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. You're not getting the better deal, but I'm still being generous 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer.  The inflation is really starting to hurt Alice, and I think I can push for a better split.  It's risky, but I'm going to try to get a deal that's closer to 50/50."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to give up too much. You're getting a decent share, but I'm the one who's been making the offers so far. You should be more grateful 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, the inflation is starting to take a serious toll on both of us. I need to accept this deal before the remaining value dwindles to nothing."
