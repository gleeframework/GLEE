"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split, but I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $6,000 is now worth $5,400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept a gain of $2,000, which is worth $1,800 in this round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
