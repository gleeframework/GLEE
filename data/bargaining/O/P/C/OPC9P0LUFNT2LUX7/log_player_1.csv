Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  It's highly unlikely Bob will accept this, but it sets the stage for future negotiations. I want to see how he reacts and gauge his level of risk aversion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very lopsided, but it's a significant improvement from the first round.  I'm going to reject this, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. The inflation is starting to become a factor, so I need to be careful not to wait too long."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split in this round. Bob's rejection of my initial offer, followed by his own generous offer, suggests he might be willing to compromise.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and with inflation looming, it's important to secure a deal."
