Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the continued devaluation of your share, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I believe this is a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's share is worth significantly less than it was initially due to inflation. Accepting the offer, even though it's unfavorable, is the best way to salvage some value from the money.  Rejecting could lead to an even worse outcome in the next round."
