"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Your turn, Alice.  I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Alice. My offer gives her a slight advantage in the short term to encourage a quick agreement.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Starting with a 50/50 split might seem fair, but it doesn't leave me much room to negotiate if Alice rejects it. This offer is a strong starting point that still allows for some flexibility.
* **Direct Communication:**  Keeping the message short and to the point avoids unnecessary complications and gets the point across efficiently."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a serious offer, Bob.  Time is money, and we're both losing out with each round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, and her offer reflects that. However, it's still tilted in her favor. I'm willing to hold out for a slightly better deal knowing that the longer we wait, the more appealing my offers will become to her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest solution.  Every round costs us both."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Even Split:**  Presenting a 50/50 split now makes it appear as a compromise on my part, even though it was always a fair offer. 
* **Highlighting Losses:** By emphasizing that every round costs us both, I'm reiterating the time pressure without appearing overly aggressive. 
* **Simplicity for Agreement:**  A simple, even split is easy for Alice to accept. The longer this goes on, the more we both stand to lose."
