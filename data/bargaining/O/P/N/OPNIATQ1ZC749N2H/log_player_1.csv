"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3000 is actually worth $2400 (20% less than $3000) and Bob's gain of $7000 is worth $6650 (5% less than $7000).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 70/30 split, especially since I'm losing value due to inflation. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting taken advantage of, I'm taking control!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being fair, but you're still getting a bad deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $4000 is worth $2080 (48.8% less than $4000) and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth $5144 (14.26% less than $6000).

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not sure I'm getting a great deal, but it's not a terrible one either. I'll accept the offer.
