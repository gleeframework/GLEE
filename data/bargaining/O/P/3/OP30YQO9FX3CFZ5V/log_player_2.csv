"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 2500 for me and 7500 for her, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slightly more favorable outcome for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 3000, ""alice_gain"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:
Bob gain: 4000 * 0.64 = 2560
Alice gain: 6000 * 0.64 = 3840

Since Alice's offer is still quite close to the original ratio, I'll accept this offer.
