"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I think 55/45 is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $45 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to $54.

I'm willing to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
