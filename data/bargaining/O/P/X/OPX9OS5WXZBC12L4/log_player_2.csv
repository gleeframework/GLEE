Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the value of waiting for a potentially better offer is diminishing rapidly for Bob due to the higher inflation rate he faces. Accepting Alice's offer, while not ideal, secures a reasonable amount before inflation further erodes the value. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The difference between Alice's offer and Bob's previous offer is getting smaller. It's unlikely Alice will drastically change her stance.
* **High Inflation:** Bob is losing value much faster than Alice.  Delaying further significantly hurts Bob's potential gain.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a specific amount. Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in Round 6 is very risky.

While Bob could hold out hope for a slightly better offer, the risk associated with the rapidly decreasing value makes accepting the current offer the more logical choice."
