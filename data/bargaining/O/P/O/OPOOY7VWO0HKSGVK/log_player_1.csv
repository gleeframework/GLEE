Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I want to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, a 50/50 split is a good deal. It's better than risking going to the next round and getting even less."
