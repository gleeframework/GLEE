"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice! Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's offer, I'm still in a strong position. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was slightly better than mine, I'll try to make an even better offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob! I'll meet you in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly better split in my favor, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the middle! Let's meet at 50/50 and end this! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a bite out of Bob's offer! With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, I think I can do better than a 50/50 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the significant decrease in value of Bob's offer due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's offer getting closer to 50/50, I'll try to take advantage of the inflation and make a stronger move. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""You were close, Bob! I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly better split in my favor, taking into account the reduced value of Bob's offer due to inflation."
