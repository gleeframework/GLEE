"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 70/30 split seems fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
It's too early to accept a 70/30 split. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a 40% share, but I'm also taking into account the inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the money is literally evaporating.  I'm coming down to 65%, let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. We've got time, and the inflation is working against her more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to go down to 55/45, but I'm not going lower.  Let's make a deal before the inflation eats away at our profits.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. 60/40 is my final offer. Take it before the inflation makes this whole thing pointless for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Alice's final offer of 60/40 is reasonable considering the inflation and the limited rounds remaining. It's better to secure something than risk losing everything."
