"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, and the inflation means that my share is worth even less. I'm going to reject this and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a majority share. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm hoping a more moderate proposal will be more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is taking its toll. This offer is a fair split and guarantees me something. I'm accepting to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
