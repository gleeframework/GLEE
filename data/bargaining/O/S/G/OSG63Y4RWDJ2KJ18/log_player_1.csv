"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a generous 30% of the total. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get a decent share, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the offer, I think I'll have to be a bit more cautious. If we split the money evenly, I'll get $50, but due to inflation, that's only worth $40 in terms of its original value. I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in purchasing power.

I'll reject the offer and wait for the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 20% bite, the money is worth 64% of its original value now (100% - 4 x 20% = 64%). To account for this, I'll aim to get a bit more in the next offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself to maintain my purchasing power. Accept and we can move forward!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share this time, but I need to secure a larger portion for myself to compensate for the inflation.  Let's move forward with this offer and avoid any further losses due to the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now! The money is worth only 41.2% of its original value (100% - 4 x 20% = 100% - 80% = 20% * 2.05 = 40.8% of the original value).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $40, which is worth only $16.32 in terms of its original value. I'd like to get more to maintain my purchasing power.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and the offer is still on the table. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
