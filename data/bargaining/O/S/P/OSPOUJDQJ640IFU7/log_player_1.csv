"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not a fair start. I'm proposing a more equitable split.  Consider the inflation working against you - let's settle this now and both walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than his previous offer, it still isn't a fair split, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round.  I know he's trying to use the pressure of inflation against me, but I'll play this strategically."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. We both know inflation is a factor, but I'm not going to let it dictate how we split this money.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it allows us both to walk away with a decent share.  Accept this and let's end this quickly. Reject, and we both risk getting less.""}
