Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's not a fair start. I'm proposing a more equitable split.  Consider the inflation working against you - let's settle this now and both walk away with a good deal.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We both know inflation is a factor, but I'm not going to let it dictate how we split this money.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it allows us both to walk away with a decent share.  Accept this and let's end this quickly. Reject, and we both risk getting less. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
