"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a big chunk, but I want a little something too 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get 70% of the current value of the money, which is 70% of 90% of the initial 100$ (since it's worth 10% less). That's equivalent to 63$.

On the other hand, Bob is offering me 30% of the current value of the money, which is 30% of 80% of the initial 100$ (since it's worth 20% less). That's equivalent to 24$.

Considering the offers, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a better deal. I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 100$, which is equivalent to 55% of 90% of the initial 100$ (since it's worth 10% less). That's equivalent to 49.5$. Bob will get the remaining 45% of the current value of the money, which is 45% of 80% of the initial 100$ (since it's worth 20% less). That's equivalent to 36$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get left with nothing 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Considering the effects of inflation, the money is worth even less for me now. If I accept this offer, I'll get 75% of the current value of the money, which is 75% of 73.3% of the initial 100$ (since it's worth 27.1% less). That's equivalent to 43.5$.

On the other hand, Bob is offering me 25% of the current value of the money, which is 25% of 51.2% of the initial 100$ (since it's worth 48.8% less). That's equivalent to 6.4$.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting a decent chunk of the money, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
