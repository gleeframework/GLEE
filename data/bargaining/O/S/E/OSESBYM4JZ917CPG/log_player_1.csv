"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68
}
```

This way, I'll get 32% of the current value of the money, and Bob will get 68%."
