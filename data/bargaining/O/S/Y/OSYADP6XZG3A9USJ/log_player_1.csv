"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. I've included a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Since this is the first round, the money is still worth its full value to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see the reasonableness of the offer and accept it, ending the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is now worth 20% less, the $4000 offered by Bob is actually worth only $3200 to me. Considering this, I don't think the offer is fair, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nSince the money is now worth 20% less to me than its original value, and considering Bob's previous offer, I'm making a slightly more generous offer to Bob while still trying to maximize my gain. I'm offering $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob, and including a message suggesting we meet in the middle, hoping Bob will see this as a compromise and accept the offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
