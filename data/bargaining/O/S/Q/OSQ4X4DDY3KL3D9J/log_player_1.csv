Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided deal in my favor. I figure if I offer Bob just $1, he might be tempted to accept it, especially since I don't know how inflation is affecting him. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, Bob's offer is significantly better than the $1 I was originally offered. With inflation affecting Bob's share, accepting this offer seems like the best option."
