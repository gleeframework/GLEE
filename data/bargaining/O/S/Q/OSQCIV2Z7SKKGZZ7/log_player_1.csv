Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But I think I deserve a bit more this time. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both losing value with each round. Let's be realistic and split it closer to 50/50. This offer is fair considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Bob is right about the time pressure, he's losing value far quicker than I am. I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can secure a better deal.  I'm hoping he'll become more agreeable to avoid getting nothing."
