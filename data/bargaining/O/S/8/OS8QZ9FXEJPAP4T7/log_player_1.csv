"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, a fair and simple division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is now worth 36 (40 * 0.9) and Bob's gain of 60 is now worth 48 (60 * 0.8).

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm not getting a better offer, so I'll accept.
