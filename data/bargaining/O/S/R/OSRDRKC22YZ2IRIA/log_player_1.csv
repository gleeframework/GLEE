"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to consider that. In the first round, $400,000 was 40% of the total, but now it's 40% of 80% of the original amount (due to 20% inflation). That's 32% of the original amount.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer, as I'll be getting 32% of the original $1,000,000.
