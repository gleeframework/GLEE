Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's avoid the risk of getting nothing and split the money fairly. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The rate of inflation is hurting me more than it's hurting her, so she's likely to keep pushing for a larger share. I need to hold out for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. We're both losing money with each passing round.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  We're running out of rounds, and the inflation is escalating. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is the most objectively fair outcome given the circumstances.
* **Finality:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept. If she rejects this, I'm prepared to play hardball in the remaining rounds, even if it means risking the entire amount."
