900000.0,100000.0,"Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $900,000, you take $100,000.  It's a lot of money for you and saves us both a lot of time.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering I'm taking the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, your sense of fairness is interesting.  How about we try a 70/30 split, but in my favor this time? It's still a much better deal than you'll get if we run out of time.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, it seems we both agree on a 70/30 split being reasonable, just not on which one of us should benefit. Let's be pragmatic. I'm lowering my cut to 60%.  Take it while it's still a good deal for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, you're right, we seem to agree on the split.  How about we meet in the middle?  60/40 to me.  It's better than what you'll get if you keep pushing.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time.  I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best offer you'll get from me.  We're running out of time to make a deal.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, you're killing me here. Fine, 55/45, but you're getting the worse end of the deal. Take it before I change my mind!",Alice,7,
