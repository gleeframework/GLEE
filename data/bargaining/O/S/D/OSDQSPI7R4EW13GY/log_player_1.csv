Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose an even split. Let's see if Bob is happy with that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I'm worried about the decreasing value of the money. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least $40, which is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
