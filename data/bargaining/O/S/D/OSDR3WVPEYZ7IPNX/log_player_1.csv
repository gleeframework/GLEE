Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a quick resolution, Alice. However, I believe a more balanced split is fair given the decreasing value of the money.  This offer is better for me than your previous offer after just one round of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
