"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50-50 split. It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with the money losing value due to inflation.
