Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm taking a risk here, but I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation factor.  Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome. It's better than risking another round and potentially getting a worse deal."
