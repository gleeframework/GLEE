"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping 90% of the original amount, which is a fair starting point, and giving Bob a small amount to get him involved in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving you all the money. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take this deal and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my initial one, but I'm still keeping a slight edge due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. Take this deal and save face. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain now. My gain is worth only 72.9% of what it was in the first round. I'm getting desperate, indeed!

I'll reject this offer, but I'll have to be more careful with my next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain now. My gain is worth only 64.58% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be more aggressive with my next offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger. Take this deal or I'll walk away with nothing.""
}
```"
