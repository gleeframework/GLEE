"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20%""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small portion, but still a fair share, and keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 40 is actually equivalent to 32 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's better than the previous one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the second round, my gain of 40 is actually equivalent to 32 in the second round's value, and 25.6 in the first round's value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, aiming for a 50/50 split."
