Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're approaching a critical point.  You're right that my share is decreasing in value, but that makes it even more important for us to agree soon.  I'm holding firm on this offer to show you I'm serious about finding a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use psychological tactics, emphasizing the decreasing value of her share. However, she's still asking for more than half. Accepting now sets a bad precedent. I'll offer a more appealing split in the next round to incentivize her while time is still on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you a deal you can't refuse. This is as close to even as we're going to get. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Offering $490,000 is a significant move towards Alice's previous demands. It demonstrates willingness to compromise and creates pressure for her to accept.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Emphasizing the shrinking value of her share due to inflation reinforces the need for a quick decision in Bob's favor.
* **Slight Advantage:** While close to even, Bob still secures a slightly larger amount, maximizing his potential gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want to split as evenly as possible, but the time pressure hurts me more than you. This is my final compromise. If you refuse, I'll have to prioritize what little value is left for me. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point, but several factors push me to accept:

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, accepting a 48/52 split is far better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds where Alice's share (and therefore her negotiating power) diminishes significantly.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language suggests this is her final offer. Rejecting it might lead to more aggressive demands in future rounds as she tries to salvage value.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of reaching no agreement and getting $0 increases. It's better to secure a decent amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
