"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amount I'll get is $475,000 (95% of $500,000).

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation (5% in the first round and another 5% in the second round), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more. Think about it.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 55-45 split, which should give me a bit more considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Okay, let me calculate the actual amount I'd get with Bob's offer... 

The original $1,000,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value due to inflation (1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574). So, $450,000 is worth $385,830.

Considering this, I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk going into more rounds with even lower gains due to inflation."
