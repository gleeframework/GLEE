"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven split. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount right away, or if he's willing to risk the money shrinking in value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the split is still uneven, it's significantly better than the first round, and I'm not sure how much more leverage I have.  There's a chance that Bob will get even more greedy in the next round.  Accepting seems like the best strategy."
