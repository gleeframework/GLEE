Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more equitable, considering the money will be worth less in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. This offer gives me a slight advantage, but we both get a larger share than in previous rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is framed as a compromise, the inflation heavily favors him. Accepting 450,000 now is a poor deal considering it's worth less than half its original value to me. I need to push for a more significant share in the upcoming rounds to make up for the rapid devaluation."

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapid Devaluation:** The money is losing value quickly, especially for me.  Waiting longer means significantly less potential gain regardless of the split.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share and is unlikely to agree to a deal heavily favoring me at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks us running out of rounds and getting nothing. Accepting guarantees a reasonable sum considering the circumstances."
