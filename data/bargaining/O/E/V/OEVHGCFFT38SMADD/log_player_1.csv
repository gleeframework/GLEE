"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I can infer that the total amount of money is decreasing by 20% from the first round to the second round.

In the first round, the total amount was $10,000. Since the money I gain is worth the same, I can assume that the total amount in the second round is $8,000.

Bob's offer is 4000 for me and 6000 for him, which adds up to $10,000, not $8,000. This seems suspicious.

I will reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and I want to make a more favorable offer to Bob, I'll aim to offer him a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""A more generous offer, considering the decreasing value of money!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not convinced you're being generous enough, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation:

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can assume that the total amount of money is decreasing by 48.8% from the first round to the fourth round. 

In the first round, the total amount was $10,000. Since the money I gain is worth the same, I can calculate the total amount in the fourth round as follows:

$10,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $5,200

Bob's offer is 4500 for me and 5500 for him, which adds up to $10,000, not $5,200. This is a clear discrepancy.

I will reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and I want to make a more reasonable offer considering the decreasing value of money, I'll aim to offer a smaller share to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm offering a smaller share to you, but still a fair one!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm being cautious about the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take the majority this time! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation:

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can assume that the total amount of money is decreasing by 67.23% from the first round to the sixth round.

In the first round, the total amount was $10,000. Since the money I gain is worth the same, I can calculate the total amount in the sixth round as follows:

$10,000 * (1 - 0.6723) = $3,273.70

Bob's offer is 5500 for me and 4500 for him, which adds up to $10,000, not $3,273.70. This is another clear discrepancy.

I will reject the offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, and I want to make a more realistic offer considering the decreasing value of money, I'll aim to offer a smaller share to myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the extreme inflation, I'm offering a very small share to myself, but it's still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm being very cautious about the decreasing value of money and offering a very small share to myself, hoping Bob will accept."
