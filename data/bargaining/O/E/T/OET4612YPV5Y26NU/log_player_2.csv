Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one! I'm heavily incentivized to take almost anything due to the steep inflation working against me. While Alice's offer isn't great, rejecting it means risking an even worse deal in the next round. 

Let's do some quick math:

* **Round 1 equivalent of Alice's offer:** $4100 is approximately 65.61% of the original $6250 I was aiming for. 
* **Potential loss next round:**  If the trend continues, I'll likely be offered even less in Round 6,  meaning I could lose another substantial chunk of value.

It's painful, but taking the $4100 now is the safest option to avoid getting a potentially much worse deal in the next round."
