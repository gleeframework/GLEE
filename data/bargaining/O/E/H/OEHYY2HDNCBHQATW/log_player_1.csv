"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10 and keeping $90 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for a better split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $40 is worth 10% less than my gain of $90 in the first round, so it's actually $63.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further. $60 for Bob seems a bit too high for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the first round, my gain of $63 is now worth $49.40.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45 and keeping $55 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think I should get the majority 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $49.40 is now worth 27.1% less, which is approximately $36.00.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I should get only $30. Bob's offer is too skewed in his favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40.91% less than in the first round, my gain of $36.00 is now worth approximately $21.64.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's the fairest way!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise."
