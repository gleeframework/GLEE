"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 60-40, which is a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 20% less now.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining money so easily. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not backing down. Meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is closer to my original offer, but still leaves some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not willing to give in, so I'll take a stronger stance. I deserve more for being bold. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings!

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining money, even if it's worth less than it was initially. I'll try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but only if you're willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will see sense and agree to this deal."
