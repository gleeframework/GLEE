"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I think a slight advantage for me is reasonable considering I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. Your offer was a bit too advantageous for you.  I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.""}
``` 
 
**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Reversal:** I'm mirroring Alice's offer but reversing the amounts. This signals that I understand the concept of a first-mover advantage but want a fairer deal.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message is direct and calls out the imbalance of Alice's offer.  The language ""let's be reasonable"" aims for a collaborative tone rather than an aggressive one. 
* **Time Pressure:** The clock is ticking, and the value of the money is decreasing. This offer puts the pressure on Alice to consider a less favorable deal or risk losing even more value in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. Let's stop wasting time with inflated offers and split this evenly. 50/50, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Explanation:**

* **Fair Deal:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair, especially after two rounds of negotiation. 
* **Inflation Impact:**  We've already lost 19% of the initial value. Holding out for a marginally better deal isn't worth the risk of further devaluation or reaching no agreement at all.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** Alice's ""take it or leave it"" tone suggests she might be firm on this offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks creating a stalemate and ultimately getting nothing."
