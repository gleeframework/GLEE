"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money almost evenly.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better offer. Since we're in the first round, the money hasn't lost much value yet, so I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a more favorable split. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor this time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be fair again.  I think an even split is the best way to go.  If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both lose money! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Since the money is losing value with each round, and we've already lost some value, accepting an even split now seems like the best option to maximize my gain. Further negotiations might lead to more loss due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###"
