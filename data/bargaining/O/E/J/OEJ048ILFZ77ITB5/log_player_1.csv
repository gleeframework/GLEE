"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get away with a 50/50 split that easily! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as enthusiastic about Bob's offer. However, it's still a decent proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to compensate for the reduced value of money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses more value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing your luck, Alice! I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! Given the reduced value of money, Bob's offer is actually a decent proposal. I'm not thrilled about giving up 60, but it's better than continuing to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get under the current circumstances."
