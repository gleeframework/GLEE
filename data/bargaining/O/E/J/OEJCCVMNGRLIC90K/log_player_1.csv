"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. The message is just a friendly greeting to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started strong, now it's my turn to counter! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making my decision.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still be getting $900,000, but for Bob, the money is worth 5% less, so he's proposing that he gets $855,000 (90% of $900,000).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting aggressive, but I'm still willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 95% of the money, and Bob gets 5%. My message is a bit playful, hinting that Bob's previous offer was a bit too aggressive, but I'm still open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, time to take the middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still be getting $950,000. For Bob, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the $900,000 he proposed in round 1 would be worth $775,000 in this round. However, he's now proposing that he gets $950,000, which is more than that.

I think this is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal, so I'll accept the offer.
