Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a bigger share than 6000.  Let's split it 70/30.""} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll compromise again, but I need a slightly better deal. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the inflation has hit me hard, and I'm getting significantly less than in the first round, I have to accept.  There's a good chance Bob will reject my offer in the next round, and I'm not sure I can afford to wait any longer.  4500 is better than nothing."
