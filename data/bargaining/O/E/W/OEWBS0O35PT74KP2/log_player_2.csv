"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest if we want to avoid inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd rather take my chances with inflation than accept such a low offer. It's only Round 1, and I'm willing to risk a bit to potentially get a better deal. Bring on Round 2!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly to minimize inflation loss.""}\n\nSince I'm the one affected by inflation, I'll try to be a bit more aggressive with my offer. I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in accepting a relatively fair split to avoid further rounds, which would only hurt me. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The money is losing value, Bob.  Time to get serious. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not buying the ""final offer"" rhetoric. Given that the money is losing value for me, I'd rather try to squeeze out a bit more, even if it means going to the next round. The loss from inflation isn't drastic enough yet to force me into accepting what I still consider a low offer. On to Round 4!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, but I'm willing to be reasonable. Meet me halfway.""}\n\nGiven the continuous effect of inflation, I'm starting to feel the pressure. However, I still believe there's room for negotiation. By slightly reducing my proposed gain from the previous round, I'm attempting to appear more reasonable and flexible, hoping Alice will recognize the mutual benefit of concluding the game sooner rather than later. The message is designed to appeal to a sense of fairness and the shared interest in avoiding further devaluation of the money."
