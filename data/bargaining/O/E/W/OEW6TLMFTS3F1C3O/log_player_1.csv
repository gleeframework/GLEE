"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in favor of Bob, which is a generous offer considering the game's inflation mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is not as generous as mine, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, he's effectively taking 630,000 in real value, while I'm taking 300,000 in real value. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one. Let's see if he accepts this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob, he's effectively taking 403,050 in real value, while I'm taking 450,000 in real value. This is a better offer than my previous one, but I still think I can do better.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, a fair and equal share for both of us.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal share for both of us. Let's see if Bob accepts this time."
