"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'll let Bob decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, I'm not afraid of a little risk! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since Bob is taking a bigger risk with a 70-30 split, I'll have to weigh the potential benefits against the increased risk.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I'll have to be strategic about my next offer. Considering Bob's aggressive 70-30 split in the previous round, I'll try to counter with a more conservative proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to cover the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm getting desperate, indeed! With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

However, with Bob's aggressive 80-20 split, I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal. I'll have to weigh the benefits against the risks.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is dwindling rapidly! I'll have to be even more strategic with my next offer. Considering Bob's previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive move to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting desperate, I'm just getting smart - meet me in the middle""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to being left with nothing, don't make me have to take it all! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting! I'm getting close to being left with nothing, indeed!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I have a choice. With the money worth so little, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

However, with Bob's 90-10 split, I'm not getting a fair deal at all. I'll have to decide whether to hold out for a better offer or take what's left.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is almost worthless! I'll have to make a final push to get a decent deal.

Considering Bob's previous offers, I'll try to make a last-ditch effort to get a better share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5,
  ""bob_gain"": 95,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going down without a fight, take what's left""
}
```

I'm essentially giving up, but at least I'll have some small amount left."
