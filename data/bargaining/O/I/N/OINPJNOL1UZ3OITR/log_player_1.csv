"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I get a slight edge, but it's not too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach this time. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm trying to get a bit more than a 50/50 split, but not too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth even less now, and Bob's offer is a 40/60 split in his favor. I think I should take this offer, as it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in future rounds.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
