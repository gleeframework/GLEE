"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm making a fair offer to split the money equally, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll value the $300,000 at 90% of its original value, which is $270,000.

Bob's offer is not as generous as I had hoped, but it's still a decent share. I'll decide to reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll aim to gain a larger share to compensate for the loss. I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share to account for inflation, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```"
