"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering a division of $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with a message suggesting that a 60-40 split is a fair and reasonable starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a more fair split, considering the inflation rate. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite considering the inflation rate, the proposed split of 55-45 still seems too favorable to Bob, especially since the money is worth 10% less to me in this round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to go down to 58-42. Let's meet in the middle.""}\n\nI'm making a new offer of $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob, taking into account the inflation and trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. I'm hoping this revised proposal will be more acceptable to Bob."
