"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous split, but I'm keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth less, so I'd rather get a larger share. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim for an even more generous split to compensate. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
