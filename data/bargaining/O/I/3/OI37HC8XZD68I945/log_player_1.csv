Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Considering the inflation hits you harder, I think this is a more balanced offer.

""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value decreases with each round.  My turn to propose - I'll take $55, you get $45. It's a better deal than you'll get in later rounds.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is on my side, and your share is losing value fast. This is a generous offer, considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping the inflation will erode my potential gains and force me to accept a bad deal.  While the offer is getting close to acceptable, I need to show strength and willingness to risk it all going to zero.  There's still enough rounds for me to push for a better outcome."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is fair and avoids the risk of us both walking away with nothing. Let's end this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me.  It's getting risky to keep pushing for a slightly larger share.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  Bob is likely to perceive this as a significant concession on my part, which could make him more amenable to accepting.
* **Clean and Simple:**  A 50/50 split is easy to understand and presents no room for misinterpretation or perceived unfairness."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value fast, and I'm not feeling the pinch. This is a better offer than you'll get if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical.  While not ideal, Bob's offer of $38 is barely acceptable at this point. 

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation is eating away at my potential gains at an alarming rate.  Waiting any longer is highly likely to result in an even worse deal, or even nothing at all. 
* **Shift in Power:** Bob knows I'm feeling the pressure, and he's unlikely to offer anything better in the remaining rounds. 

It's painful to accept less than half, but in this scenario, something is better than nothing."
