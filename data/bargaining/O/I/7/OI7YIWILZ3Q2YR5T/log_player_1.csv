"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me a significant majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount to make it worth his while to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully... Since the money is worth 20% less, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still keeping a significant majority for myself."
