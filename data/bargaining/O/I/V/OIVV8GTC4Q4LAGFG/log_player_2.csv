Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's as close to the middle as I can get considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation around a 60/40 split, but the inflation heavily favors me. While she might feel the pressure of the decreasing value, it's still early in the game. I need to push for a more significant advantage on my end."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against you. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this quickly and fairly."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** The inflation is a significant factor working in my favor.  Alice is losing value with every passing round, while my potential gain remains constant.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are now in Round 4 out of 12. Stalling for too long benefits no one. It's time to apply more pressure.
* **Appearance of Fairness:** A 50/50 split can be presented as a fair compromise, even though it heavily favors me in reality due to the inflation mechanic. This might make it more palatable for Alice to accept."
