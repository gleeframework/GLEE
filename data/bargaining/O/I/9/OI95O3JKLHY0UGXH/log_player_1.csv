"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority this time""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer since it's a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we have 12 rounds to work with. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially since I was willing to offer 60% to Bob in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal than this. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not going to give up too much""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for Bob than my original offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55, and you can have 45.  We both get a better deal than the last round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Meeting in the middle is a fair way to divide the money, and I'll get a decent amount even with a 45/55 split. I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting a worse deal due to further inflation."
