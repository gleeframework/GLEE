"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can move on with our lives!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair start. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a good share, Alice. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit more generous, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer. However, I'll still keep in mind the inflation and try to get a good deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You were kind in round 2, Bob. I'll match your generosity, but let's not forget the inflation!""
}
```"
