I propose to take 990,000 dollars and give Bob 10,000 dollars. This way, I get the majority of the money, and Bob still gets a small amount.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting less than I wanted initially, it's still a significant amount of money, and it's better than getting nothing due to the inflation."
