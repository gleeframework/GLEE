Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, hoping to secure most of the money early on. I figure Bob might be surprised by the inflation and accept this deal before it kicks in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my initial proposal, but I'm not convinced it's worth accepting yet. With the 20% inflation, I'm losing a significant chunk of value, and I still have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if I can secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try a compromise.  I'm still aiming for a larger share, but this offer is closer to Bob's previous proposal.  I'm hoping he'll be more open to a deal now that he knows I'm not willing to settle for a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has taken a significant toll on the value of my potential gains.  While I'm not happy with this 40/60 split, it's better than facing another round of inflation and potentially getting an even worse offer from Bob. I'll accept the offer to secure some value before it gets further diminished."
