"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $6,000. This way, we can both get a decent amount and still have a chance to negotiate further in the subsequent rounds."

Round 2

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 2000 * 0.95 = 1900
* Bob gain: 8000 * 0.95 = 7600

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than that.
