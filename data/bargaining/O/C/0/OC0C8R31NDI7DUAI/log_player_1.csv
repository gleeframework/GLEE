"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 200,000 between us in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm suggesting that if Bob accepts, we can split the remaining $200,000 in the next round, which will be worth $190,000 for me and $180,000 for Bob due to the 10% and 5% devaluations, respectively."
