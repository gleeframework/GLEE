"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an initial offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually more appealing to me now. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
