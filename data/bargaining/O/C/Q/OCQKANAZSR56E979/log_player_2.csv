"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, it heavily favors her in the long run. The inflation rate heavily impacts me as Bob, and accepting this offer leaves me with a significantly devalued amount in later rounds. It's worth negotiating for a better split, even if it means risking a few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your initial offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle - this split acknowledges the inflation but is still fair.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Inflation:**  This offer recognizes the inflation disparity, showing Alice I'm aware of the game's dynamics.
* **Compromise:**  Moving closer to the middle ground demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Early Negotiation:**  While I could push for more, settling early avoids the risk of the money devaluing significantly in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering we both lose value each round, this is a slightly more generous offer, but I still need to account for the lesser impact of inflation on my side. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to sweeten the deal incrementally, but it's not enough. While the offer is slightly better, it's clear she's aiming to secure a significant advantage throughout the game.  The inflation is working against me more with each passing round, but holding out for a more equitable split is still the better strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to a critical point where the inflation will start eating significantly into the pot.  This is my final offer, let's be reasonable and close the deal.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:**  This offer is a significant jump from my previous, signaling a willingness to compromise but also firmness.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting the rapidly approaching point of significant devaluation adds pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Finality:**  Presenting this as my ""final offer""  communicates that I'm serious and unwilling to be lowballed further. 
* **Appeal to Reason:**   The message emphasizes fairness and encourages Alice to make a rational decision considering the game's dynamics."
