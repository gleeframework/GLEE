This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Waiting any longer means I'll likely get even less.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems determined to take a larger share and is becoming more aggressive. It's unlikely she'll offer a better deal in future rounds.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees me $400,000. Rejecting risks getting an even worse offer, or nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement.

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice given the circumstances."
