"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20. Fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward split that leaves both of us with a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing by 20% each round, I'll need to be more aggressive in my negotiation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing by 20% each round, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to take the lead in this negotiation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a 70-30 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better deal 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing significantly, I'll need to be cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 65-35 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob, or try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing rapidly, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I need to get a better share to make this worth it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly worse deal than my previous offer, but I'm trying to get a 75-25 split to make up for the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a risk too, let's split it 50/50 and make it a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing rapidly, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split, as the value of the money is decreasing so much that it's hard to get a better deal. Let's call it a fair split and end the game."
