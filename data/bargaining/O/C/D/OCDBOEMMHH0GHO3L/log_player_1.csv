Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you get $4,000. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"

# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's go with that. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 60/40 split is not in my favor, and I'd rather not give up that much. I'll reject this offer.
