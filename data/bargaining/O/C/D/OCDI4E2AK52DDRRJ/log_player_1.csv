I'm going to be greedy and try to get as much as possible in the first round, since the money will lose value quickly."

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm getting less than before, I can still try to get a better deal. There are still 10 rounds left, and the inflation will start to hurt Bob more than me."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share than before, hoping to incentivize him to accept. I'm still aiming for the majority of the money, but I need to balance that with the risk of further rounds and the potential for him to get even more greedy."

Bob is getting more aggressive, but I'm still going to reject his offer. Inflation is hurting me more now, but it will start to hurt Bob more soon. I can still hold out for a better deal."

I'm going to offer Bob a more substantial share this time. The inflation is starting to hit me hard, and I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding a complete loss. This offer gives Bob a significant increase from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money."

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still going to reject it. Even though the inflation is really hurting me now, I'm hoping that Bob will start to feel the pressure soon as well. I'm also hoping to get a slightly better deal than this."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a larger share again.  The inflation is really starting to hurt me, but I need to find a compromise soon.  This offer still gives me a majority, but it's a significant concession to try and reach an agreement."
