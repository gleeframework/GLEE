"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering that the money loses value with each round. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can both walk away with a decent amount."

# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Inflation hurts, so let's make this efficient. I propose a larger share for me to account for the rapid devaluation of the money we stand to gain in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
