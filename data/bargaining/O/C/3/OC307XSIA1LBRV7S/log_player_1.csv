"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, he's effectively offering me 400,000 and keeping 600,000. I can do better than that. I'll reject the offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a bit more than before. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
