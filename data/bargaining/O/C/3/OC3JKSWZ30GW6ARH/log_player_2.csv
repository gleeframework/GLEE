"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Let's see how this plays out. While not the best offer for me, it's a reasonable starting point, and Alice's devaluation is significant.  I'll try to leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. This accounts for the money devaluation in the next round for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects us both, Bob. This offer acknowledges that while still leaning towards a fairer agreement for me considering my higher devaluation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the higher devaluation, and her offer reflects that. However, it's still skewed more in her favor than I'd like. I'm willing to gamble one more round and see if I can get closer to an even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is practically an even split, recognizing the devaluation we both face.  Let's close this deal.""}
