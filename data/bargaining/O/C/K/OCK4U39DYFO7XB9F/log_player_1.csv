"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going to start with a fair offer, but keep in mind that inflation will benefit me if we go into later rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'll reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I know inflation is working against me, and a 50/50 split is leaving too much on the table for me. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than last round, but still a significant amount.  Inflation is biting, and I need to get the most I can while I can."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still rejecting.  While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, Bob is still offering me less than what I offered in the first round. I'll keep trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm going to try to bridge the gap a bit. This offer is still significantly more favorable to me than the previous offer from Bob, and hopefully it's enough to entice him into accepting. Inflation is getting serious now, and I need to secure something before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is getting ridiculous. While I'm losing a lot of value from inflation, Bob is offering me less than half of what he offered in the previous round. I'm going to keep holding out for a better offer, even though I know the clock is ticking."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439}
```

I'm going to try a smaller offer again. Inflation is really hurting me now, but I have to keep trying to get the most I can. If this doesn't work, I might have to accept a much worse deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I can't believe Bob is still trying to get away with such a low offer!  I'm losing more and more value with each round, but I'm going to stick to my guns and keep trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than last round. The inflation is biting, and I need to secure something before it's too late. I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is becoming a game of pure stubbornness.  While I am losing a lot of value from inflation, Bob is still offering me less than what he offered in the previous round.  I'm going to keep holding out for a better deal. There are only a few rounds left, and I'm hoping he'll realize it's in his best interest to come to an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5314, ""bob_gain"": 4686}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a move. This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share, but it's still a decent amount for me given the heavy inflation.  I hope Bob will finally see reason and agree to this split before we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a very tough decision.  I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, and Bob's offer is far from what I would have wanted in the beginning. But, with only one round left, I know that rejecting this offer will mean getting nothing. So,  I'll accept the offer. It's better than getting nothing at all."
