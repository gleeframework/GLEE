,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,My turn! How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It's better than waiting and losing money to inflation.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40. Let's split it 55/45, that way we both get something closer to our original 50/50.  Inflation is hitting us both, remember!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Okay, let's meet in the middle. 58/42 - I'm taking a small hit on my previous offer because of the inflation, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",Bob,4,
