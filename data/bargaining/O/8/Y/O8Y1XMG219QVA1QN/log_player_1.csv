I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping to secure a quick win.  I'm confident Bob will accept this, as it's a better deal than he'll get later due to inflation.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I'm still getting a fair share compared to what I'd likely get in the next round. It's better to secure something now than risk losing more in the future."
