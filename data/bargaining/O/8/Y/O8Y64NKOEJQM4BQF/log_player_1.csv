"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested in negotiating.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a small amount to keep him engaged, while I'm taking the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away the whole pie just yet 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. Here's my new proposal:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and split the remaining amount.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but still keeping a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, Bob. Meet me at 540k, or we'll have to keep negotiating.""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to my desired share, while still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
