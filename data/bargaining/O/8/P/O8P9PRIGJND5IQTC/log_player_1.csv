Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a high gain for myself in the first round, but still leaving a small amount for Bob. This will hopefully encourage him to accept the offer to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much better for him, and I'm not willing to accept such a low gain for myself. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.  While it's still a better deal for me, it's more reasonable and may encourage Bob to accept.  The inflation is starting to kick in, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
