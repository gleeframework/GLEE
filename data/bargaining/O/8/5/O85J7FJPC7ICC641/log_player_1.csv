"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90% this time. You can decide if you want to play this game further or not. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the majority of the money.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 900,000$ just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 6:4""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
