Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split in your favor is more than fair. This round, you lose 20% and I only lose 10% if we don't agree.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
