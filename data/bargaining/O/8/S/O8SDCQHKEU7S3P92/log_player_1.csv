"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll need to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to be cautious with the inflation. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, trying to find a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target. I think we can meet in the middle and split it evenly. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation effect, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Since Bob's offer is an even split, I'll accept it. At this point, it seems like we're getting closer to a fair division, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns.
