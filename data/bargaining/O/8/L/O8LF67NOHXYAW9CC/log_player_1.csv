Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to take most of the money.  If Bob rejects, at least I'll get to propose again in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is less than what I wanted, I'm accepting it.  If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round. It's better to get something than nothing!"
