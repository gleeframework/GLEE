"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and take 600k. You can't do better than this, right?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you're still getting less than half. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. My gain of 450,000 is still less than half of the original 1,000,000, and I'm not convinced it's the best deal I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging on the 50-50 split, but I'll give you a slight edge. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you at 50-50, but only if you agree to a slight penalty for rejecting my previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to accept it. Meeting at 50-50 seems like a fair compromise, and I'm willing to swallow my pride and agree to the slight penalty for rejecting his previous offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
