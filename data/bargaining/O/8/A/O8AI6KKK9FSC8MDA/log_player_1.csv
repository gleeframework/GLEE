"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. I'm hoping this is a fair starting point and that we can reach an agreement quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

I'm willing to lower my share slightly, but I believe a 80/20 split is still fair considering the inflation affecting Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
``` 

I'm continuing to compromise, but I believe a 70/30 split is still reasonable given the inflation impacting Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if Bob will finally budge and start compromising."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my share again. I'm hoping that with each round, Bob will realize the value of the money is decreasing for him, and he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still clinging to a larger share, even though his offer is becoming less and less valuable with each round. I need to be firm and show him that I won't accept a deal that heavily favors him, especially when inflation is working against his advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're down to the wire. This is my final offer. I'm willing to split the money evenly, but this is my last compromise.  The inflation is really starting to impact both of us, and if we don't reach an agreement now, we'll both get nothing."
