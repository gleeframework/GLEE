"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll stick with my original plan. Bob's offer is 50/50, which is a fair split, but I can do better.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in Bob's offer value. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, considering the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate Bob's offer in terms of its value in the first round.

Bob's offer is 52 + 48 = 100 in the first round, but due to inflation, it's worth 100 / (1 - 0.488) = 1.952 in the first round's value. 

I'll reject this offer since it's not as good as my previous offer, considering the inflation.
