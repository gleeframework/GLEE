"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest, let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $400,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
