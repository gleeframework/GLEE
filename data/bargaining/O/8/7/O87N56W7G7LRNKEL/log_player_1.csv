"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to reverse the roles from my initial offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me in the second round, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000
Bob's gain: 600,000 * 0.95 = 570,000

Considering the reduced values, I'll accept this offer.
