"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 seems reasonable""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60-40, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This seems like a fair and reasonable starting point to me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk! 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $25 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is still a decent chunk, but not as much as I was hoping for.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob taking the majority of the $100, especially considering the value of my share is decreasing with each round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing by 5% each round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a bigger share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bigger share, but I'm still getting a decent chunk!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a significant portion of the $100. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of my money decreasing by 14.26% from the original, my $20 is now worth even less than I thought. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting 80% of the remaining $100.

I'm starting to feel like I need to make a more aggressive move to get a better share.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of my money decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I need to think carefully about my next move. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a bigger share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a smaller share, but I'm taking what I can get!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm trying to get as much as I can before the value of my money decreases further. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a tiny bit! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of my money decreasing by 22.62% from the original, my $10 is now worth a tiny fraction of what it was at the beginning. I'm getting desperate too, but I'm not sure I want to settle for such a small share.

I'm starting to think that I should try to make one last stand and negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of my money decreasing rapidly, I'll make a final, desperate offer. I'll try to get as much as I can, even if it's not the most ideal share.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 15,
  ""bob_gain"": 85,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, but I'll take this if it's the last chance""
}
```

I'm offering Bob the majority of the remaining $100, but I'm hoping that he'll accept this offer and we can finally end the game."
