"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 400k. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to stick with the 60-40 split, but with him getting the larger share.

However, I'm not impressed with the lack of creativity in his proposal. I'm going to reject his offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not impressed with the same old offer. I'll do better.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. My offer will be slightly adjusted accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
