# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer to me, it's still heavily in his favor. The inflation is starting to become significant for him, so he's feeling the pressure to settle. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if I can push him further."

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really starting to bite into Bob's potential gains, and he's clearly feeling the pressure.  While his offer is getting closer to something acceptable, I think he'll be willing to go even higher to avoid losing everything. I'll take the risk and reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time! This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - we both lose if we don't agree now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and we're both at risk of getting nothing. I'm significantly lowering my demand to 75% to make it more appealing to Bob while still securing a substantial portion of the money.  The strong language also emphasizes the urgency of the situation. This is a calculated risk, but the potential consequences of not settling are too high to ignore."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with only two rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is too high.  Bob is clearly feeling the pressure from the inflation, and his offer, while still in his favor, is the best I'm likely to get. It's better to secure a significant portion of the money now than risk losing everything."
