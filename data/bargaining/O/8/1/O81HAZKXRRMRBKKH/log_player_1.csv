"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $40 and took $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that this division is fair. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the inflation and adjust the values accordingly in future rounds.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given the value of money is decreasing.  Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of money is decreasing due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens.\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of the next round.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, in the next round, the money will be worth even less due to inflation.)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's split it reasonably!""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $42 and took $58 for myself, with a message suggesting that this division is reasonable. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth even less due to inflation, so we should try to reach an agreement soon!)"
