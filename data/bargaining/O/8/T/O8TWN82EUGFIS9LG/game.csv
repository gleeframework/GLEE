6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair deal. You'll lose 5% of the value if we go to the next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I understand the inflation puts pressure on us, but my offer in the previous round was already generous. I'm willing to meet you halfway at 55/45, but that's my final offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Since you said 55/45 was your final offer, I'll assume you're not willing to compromise further. Given the inflation, I think 60/40 is a reasonable counteroffer.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against me, but dragging this out doesn't benefit either of us.  I propose a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and avoids further losses for me.",Alice,5,
