Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since you said 55/45 was your final offer, I'll assume you're not willing to compromise further. Given the inflation, I think 60/40 is a reasonable counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to take advantage of my position. He knows the inflation hurts me more with each round, so he's trying to push me to accept an offer that's increasingly unfavorable.  My offer of 55/45 in round 3 was strategically my final offer to signal I'm not budging much. I need to hold my ground and counter with a stronger offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against me, but dragging this out doesn't benefit either of us.  I propose a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and avoids further losses for me.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The inflation is increasingly hurting my position. I need to reach an agreement soon.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair and might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer, especially since he's trying to push for a 60/40 split.
* **Finality:**  By framing this as a realistic solution and the fairest option, I'm signaling that I'm unlikely to concede further. This might be enough to persuade Bob to accept."
