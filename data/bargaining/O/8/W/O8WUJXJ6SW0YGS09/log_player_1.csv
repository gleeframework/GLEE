"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 40 dollars, which is a significant portion of the initial 100 dollars. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is now more appealing. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
