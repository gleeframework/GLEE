"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering you 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll take the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $80 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $64. And your $20 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $18.

I accept your offer:
