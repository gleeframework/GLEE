"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 20, let's start with a small share.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob a relatively small share, but still a significant amount, to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not giving away too much too soon! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll, my gain is now worth 20% less than the initial $100, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 60% share, especially considering the value of money is decreasing over time. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split, no more negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to find a mutually acceptable deal and end the game."
