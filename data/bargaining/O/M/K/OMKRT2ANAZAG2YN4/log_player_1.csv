"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more fair split, since I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to make a counteroffer that's identical to my original proposal!

I'll reject this offer since it's not a new proposal. The game continues!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this round, but I'm still the one making the offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $450,000, and I'll take the remaining 55%, which is $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to go down to 550000, but I'm not going any lower. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is willing to compromise and meet in the middle!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $450,000 / 0.8586 (1 - 0.1414) = $523,511
* Bob gain: $550,000 / 0.8586 = $639,489

I'll accept this offer since it's a reasonable compromise.
