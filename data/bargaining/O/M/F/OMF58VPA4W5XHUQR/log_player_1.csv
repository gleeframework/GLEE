"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, with me getting a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more equitable arrangement is in order. Let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, I will reject this offer. Additionally, considering that the value of money decreases for Bob with each round, I might be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more conservative offer than my initial one, taking into account that the money is still worth the same to me but less to Bob. I'll propose a division of $53 for myself and $47 for Bob, along with a message suggesting that we should find a mutually acceptable middle ground.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the circumstances""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering that the money is still worth the same to me but significantly less to Bob due to inflation, and given that Bob claims this is his final offer, I will accept this deal. It seems like the best option, as further negotiations might lead to an impasse, and this division is relatively close to my previous offers.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer and conclude the game here."
