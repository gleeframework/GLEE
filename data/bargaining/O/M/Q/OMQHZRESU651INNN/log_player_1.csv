"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%. My message to Bob is to accept this offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but this is my offer, so you better take it. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the offer, I'll have to accept it since the alternative is to proceed to the next round, where the money I gain will be worth even less due to inflation. I'd rather take the minimal amount of 1$ now.
