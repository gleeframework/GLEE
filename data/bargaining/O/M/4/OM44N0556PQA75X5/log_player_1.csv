"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fairness is overrated. Let's negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less now, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,750. I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, especially since I was hoping to get a better deal earlier.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me $7,000 and Bob $3,000. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a decent one. If I accept, I'll get $4,000, which is worth about $3,471.80 in the original value. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing.
