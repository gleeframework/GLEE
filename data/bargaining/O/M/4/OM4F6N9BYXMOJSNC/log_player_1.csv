Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm thinking I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a fair share.  How about a 48/52 split?""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the offer is a bit less than I would like, the inflation makes it less worthwhile to keep rejecting offers.  I'll take the $2000 and be done with this."
