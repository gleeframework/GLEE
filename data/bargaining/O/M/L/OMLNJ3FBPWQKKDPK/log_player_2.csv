"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. Hopefully, we can find a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll try to get a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation.  Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45.  It's still not ideal, but I'd rather get something than nothing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it.  It's better than waiting another round and risking getting nothing at all."
