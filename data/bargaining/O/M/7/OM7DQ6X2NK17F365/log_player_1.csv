"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less, so the total amount is $9,500 ($10,000 x 0.95).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have $2,500 and Bob will have $7,500. It's still a significant difference, but I'm willing to compromise.
