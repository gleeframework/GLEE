Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. This is a more balanced split, and hopefully we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with the offer. I was hoping for a slightly better split, and 45% for me seems a bit low. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal. This is a fair split, don't you think?""}

I'm proposing that I get 52% of the total amount, which is $52, and Bob gets 48%, which is $48."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This is a fair offer that accounts for the inflation, and it's getting late.  We need to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that 47% is a fair share, considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I was hoping for a slightly better deal, especially since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50 and put an end to this game.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise."
