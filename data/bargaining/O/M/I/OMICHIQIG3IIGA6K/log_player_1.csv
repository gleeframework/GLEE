"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'll keep 90% and give Bob 10%. It's a good starting point, as Bob is more likely to accept it and we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While the offer is better than nothing, it's still extremely unfavorable. I would only accept an offer that is more in line with a 50/50 split. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be accepting such a lopsided deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
``` 

I'm offering a 72/28 split in my favor.  I understand inflation is affecting me more, but I'm willing to give Bob a larger share than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the offer is better than nothing, it's still very unfavorable given the inflation affecting my share significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be accepting such a lopsided deal.  I need a much larger share of the money to make it worthwhile considering the decreased value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is the best I can offer given the inflation, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a more even split than he's been offering."
