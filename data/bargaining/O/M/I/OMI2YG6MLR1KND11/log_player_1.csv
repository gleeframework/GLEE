Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself.  It's a pretty good deal for me in the first round!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though I get less than my original proposal, the inflation means Bob is getting a worse deal with each round. It's better to take the $4,000 now than risk getting even less later."
