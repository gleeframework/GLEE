"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. This way, we both have a significant amount to work with, and we can negotiate further in the next round."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that the money is worth 5% less for me now, so my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3800.

```

}

# Bob gain: 7000
