Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm taking a big chunk, but hoping to secure a deal quickly before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'm not going to accept that offer.  It's my turn to propose, and I'll aim for something fairer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm still aiming for a good chunk of the money, but I'm being a bit more reasonable this time.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept before the money loses too much more value."
