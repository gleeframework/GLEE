"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55/45, a fairer split for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll calculate the effective gains:

My gain: 45% of the original $100, which is $45, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth $42.75
Bob's gain: 55% of the original $100, which is $55, but due to 10% inflation, it's worth $49.50

I think I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
