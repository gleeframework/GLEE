"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering my higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand your inflation is higher, but this split is fairer in the long run. Let's settle it now.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding Inflation:** Alice's inflation is significantly higher (20% vs. my 5%).  She's incentivized to settle quickly. 
* **Fairness Over Rounds:** While her initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor, I need to offer something that acknowledges the inflation difference but keeps a reasonable amount for myself. 
* **Urgency:** By emphasizing ""settle it now,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice that every round makes the money less valuable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous. Don't let it slip! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting desperate:** Her message implies she needs to settle quickly and is using a ""generosity"" tactic to mask a still-unfavorable offer. 
* **My bargaining power is increasing:** Every round makes the potential money significantly less valuable to Alice, while I'm losing value at a slower rate. 
* **Holding out for a better deal:** I can afford to wait another round to see if Alice will propose a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This offer considers the time pressure we both face. It's a win-win before inflation hurts us more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** Alice's increasingly desperate offers signal my position is strengthening. I can now propose a split slightly in my favor.
* **Time Pressure Appeal:**  By highlighting ""time pressure"" and ""win-win,"" I'm appealing to Alice's rationality to end the game before the value decreases further.
* **Strategic Concession:** While I'm pushing for a better split, I'm still offering her a reasonable amount, considering her higher inflation rate. This makes my offer more enticing and increases the chance of acceptance."
