"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the 100$, and leaving 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 70$ is worth 0.95 * 70 = 66.5$ (since my gain is worth 5% less).

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
