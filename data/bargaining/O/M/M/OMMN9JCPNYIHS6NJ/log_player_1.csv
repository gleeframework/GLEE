"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making my decision.

Since Bob is offering me the same amount as I offered him in the first round, I'm not sure if I should accept or reject. However, considering that the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm actually getting less value than I would have in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll adjust my proposal to account for the decreasing value of money. I'll offer Bob a smaller amount to try to get a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his original offer, but with a 5% increase in the amount I gain and a 5% decrease in the amount he gains, compared to the previous round.

However, considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is still not very favorable to me, I'll reject it again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll adjust my proposal again to account for the increasing inflation effect. Considering that the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll offer Bob an even smaller amount to try to get a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $500,000 and keeping $500,000 for myself, trying to split the remaining value of the money more evenly."
