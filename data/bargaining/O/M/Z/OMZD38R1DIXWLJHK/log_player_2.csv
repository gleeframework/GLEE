"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids further risk of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not fair.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything that gives me less than 50%."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 550,000 for me and 450,000 for Alice. This acknowledges the inflation and demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still seeking a more equitable split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse with each round.  I'm not giving up, but I need to be strategic.  I'm willing to consider offers closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Alice.  With each round, the value of the money decreases for Alice, so a 60/40 split is starting to look like a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting increasingly unfair.  I need to push back harder and demand a better deal.  We're running out of rounds, so I need to be assertive."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm raising my offer again to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Alice. The inflation is hitting Alice hard now, and this offer is starting to look very favorable for her given the circumstances. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I hope she finally sees it that way."
