# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this evenly.  I think it's time to be reasonable, as we're both losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think this is a fair offer, considering the inflation and the fact that we're both losing money with each round. Splitting it evenly seems like a reasonable compromise."
