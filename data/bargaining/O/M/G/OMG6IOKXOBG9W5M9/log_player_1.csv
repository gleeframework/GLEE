"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but it's still fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable split given the inflation.""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the decreased value of money due to inflation, and I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to try to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, but I'm willing to give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive! Given the significant decrease in the value of money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about the 20-80 split. However, I'm willing to consider it since it's the best offer I've seen so far.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get."
