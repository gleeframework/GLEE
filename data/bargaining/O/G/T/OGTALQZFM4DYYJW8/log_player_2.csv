"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
Since the money is worth less to Alice with each round, she has a strong incentive to get the money split as quickly as possible.  Rejecting this offer will give me the opportunity to propose a split in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a more fair split, considering the value of money decreases for you each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at 55/45.  I think this is a fair split given the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a gain of $45, which is better than risking it all and ending up with nothing in the next round."
