Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I believe a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. This gives us both a good starting point.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's adjust our shares slightly. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for potential future value loss. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy considering the following:

* **Inflation:**  The money Alice gains is losing value, so her offer is effectively decreasing. 
* **Potential future offers:**  Rejecting this offer doesn't guarantee a better outcome. Alice might propose a lower share in the next round.
* **Risk Aversion:**  It's better to secure a decent gain now than risk losing more due to further inflation or a less favorable offer."
