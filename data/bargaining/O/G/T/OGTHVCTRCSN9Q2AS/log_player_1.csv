This offer is outrageous.  It's clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get the lion's share of the money.  I'm not going to accept this. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round.  I'm still confident that we can reach a fair compromise."

Bob is being incredibly unreasonable, and I'm not willing to accept such a pitiful offer.  This game has gone on long enough, and the inflation is devastating my share of the money.  I'm going to stick to my principles and reject this final offer.  It's not worth it to accept such a paltry sum."
