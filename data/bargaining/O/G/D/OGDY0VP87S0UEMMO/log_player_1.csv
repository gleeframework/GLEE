"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering your offer in the previous round. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 45% of the current $100 (not the original $100) is 45 * 0.9 = $40.5
Bob's gain: 55% of the current $100 is 55 * 0.95 = $52.25

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50. No more haggling!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a fair and equal split this time!"
