"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm being generous, but I think it's a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can do better than 30%. I'll try to negotiate or make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need some for myself""}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most, but I'm getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer. 75% is a decent share, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the deal and hope that Bob is indeed getting desperate and won't try to renege on the agreement."
