Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, but I think it's important to secure a large portion of the money early on before the inflation takes effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious concern. Accepting this offer guarantees me half of the money, even with the inflation factored in. It's a good deal considering the potential for getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
