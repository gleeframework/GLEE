"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and equal division of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'll wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze more out of me as the rounds go on. However, this offer is actually quite similar to the one I made in round 3, and considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept it to avoid further losses.
