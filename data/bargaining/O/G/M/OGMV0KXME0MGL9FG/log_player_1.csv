"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is 10% of the original amount. I'll get the remaining $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest option, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer!

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

We can split the money evenly and walk away with $5,000 each. It's a good compromise!"
