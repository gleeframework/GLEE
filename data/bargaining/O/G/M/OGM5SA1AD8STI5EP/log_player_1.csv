# Bob's message: I think this split is more equitable, giving you a good share while still being fair to me.  Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 20% less, and I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer is too low for me. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I will take into account the inflation and try to make a more reasonable offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 40% less than the original value, I will adjust my offer accordingly. I will also consider that Bob's gain is only 10% less than the original value. I will offer to take 58% of the money, which is 580,000 dollars, and Bob can have the remaining 42%, which is 420,000 dollars. My message to Bob will be: ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. Let's end this game!""
