"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer. In the first round, I was hoping for a 50/50 split, but now Bob is offering a 40/60 split, which is not as favorable to me.

However, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons. I don't want to risk going into the next round, where the money will be even less valuable.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
