Let's see what I can do in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5}
``` 
I'm offering Alice a small share, but it's better than nothing.  Let's see if she takes it!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it's not a great deal, 30$ is better than nothing, especially with the inflation factor.  I'll take it!"
