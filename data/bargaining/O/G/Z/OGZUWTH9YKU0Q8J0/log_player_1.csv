I'm going to start with a relatively even split, but give myself a larger share to account for the inflation difference between us. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my first offer, and I don't think it's reasonable. Even with inflation, I'm still getting a much smaller share. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a split that's closer to 60/40 in my favor. While I'm still willing to negotiate, I need to make sure I get a fair share to compensate for the inflation difference."
