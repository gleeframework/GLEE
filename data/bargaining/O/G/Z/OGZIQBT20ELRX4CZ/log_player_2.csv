"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the potential inflation. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is money! Let's not let inflation eat away at our potential gains. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is worse than my previous one, the inflation makes it a better deal for me than rejecting and potentially getting nothing in the next round."
