"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal. This offer heavily favors me, but it's better for you than to let the money devalue further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:** Bob's money loses value rapidly with each passing round. Alice needs to capitalize on this urgency.
* **Anchoring a High Starting Point:** By starting with a heavily skewed offer, Alice sets a benchmark that might make Bob more willing to accept a less extreme offer in later rounds. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is aggressive, it leaves some room for Alice to concede in later rounds if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable split. Let's avoid further devaluation and share the wealth more fairly. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Inflation:** While Bob's offer is more ""fair"" in a traditional sense, Alice still holds a significant advantage due to the inflation mechanic.  Bob is feeling the pressure of his money devaluing, pushing him towards a more balanced deal. 
* **Aiming Higher:** Alice's first offer was very aggressive. By rejecting Bob's counter-offer (which is significantly better for Alice than a 50/50 split), she signals that she's aiming for a more favorable outcome.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk that Bob becomes frustrated and offers a worse deal in the next round. However, the potential reward of securing a larger portion of the money outweighs this risk, especially with the inflation working in Alice's favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob. Literally. This offer is my compromise - let's end this before your share shrinks any further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice is making a significant concession from her initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, the offer still heavily favors her.
* **Emphasizing Time Pressure:** By highlighting the decreasing value of Bob's potential gain, Alice further incentivizes him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Finding a Balance:** This offer aims to find a balance between maximizing Alice's gain and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting before his share loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's reach a deal before the inflation eats away at our gains even more. 
# Alice gain: 625000 
# Bob gain: 375000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While Alice could potentially squeeze out a slightly better deal in subsequent rounds, the rate at which Bob's share is devaluing is slowing down. The difference between what Bob is offering now and what Alice might get in another round is shrinking.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a real risk that Bob becomes increasingly frustrated and offers a significantly worse deal in the next round. The current offer is already heavily in Alice's favor. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a significant portion of the potential gains.
* **Reaching a Fair Compromise (Considering Inflation):** While not perfectly reflecting a 50/50 split in nominal terms, the offer recognizes the impact of inflation. Alice is receiving a larger share, compensating for the devaluation of Bob's potential gains over time."
