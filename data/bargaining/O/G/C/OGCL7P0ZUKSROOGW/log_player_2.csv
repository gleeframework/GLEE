"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice rejected the 50/50 split, I'll try to get a better deal. Given the 10% inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share now. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I need to adjust my expectations. Alice's offer is a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
