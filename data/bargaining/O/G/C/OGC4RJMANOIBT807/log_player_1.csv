"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share and can see how the game goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round. Let's be reasonable and get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money Bob gains, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is more fair, especially since the value of Bob's gain is already reduced due to inflation. I'd like to see a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. A 55/45 split seems reasonable, but I'd like to stick to it as the proposer this round.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more flexible and meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding on to the idea that I should be the one proposing the division this round."
