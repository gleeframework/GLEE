"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. This is a good starting point, and I believe it's fair. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very unfair offer!  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a lopsided split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I propose a 60/40 split. This reflects a fairer division while still acknowledging your initial offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I believe a 70/30 split is still fair, considering the money's decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice's offer is getting closer to reasonable, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a better split, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and the money is losing value. I'm offering a 55/45 split.  Let's close this deal and walk away with something substantial.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to a 60/40 split, but I need to see some flexibility from you.  We're losing a significant amount of money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting a 60/40 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal later or even losing everything."
