Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I value fairness, the potential for inflation makes it crucial for me to secure a larger portion now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact, I propose a 55/45 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
