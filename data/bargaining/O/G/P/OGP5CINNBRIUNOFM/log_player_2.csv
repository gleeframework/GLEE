Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  55/45 is fair, and it's the same split you offered me before! Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly better split, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases substantially. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 
* **Previous Offer:** Alice is now willing to accept the 55/45 split I initially proposed. This suggests she is serious about reaching a deal and less likely to budge further.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly larger share in later rounds isn't worth the risk of significant losses due to inflation.  

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than gamble on a potentially better but riskier outcome later.
