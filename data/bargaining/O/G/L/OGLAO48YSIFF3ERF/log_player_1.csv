"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 in my favor""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not going for 40% 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 3000 is now worth 20% less than in the first round, which is 2400. And Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 5% less than in the first round, which is 6665.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm still getting a decent amount, but I'm not getting the majority of the money. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect 60-40 again""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
