"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for a good negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50$ is worth 95% of the initial amount, which is $47.50.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems fair and we'll be able to divide the money quickly.
