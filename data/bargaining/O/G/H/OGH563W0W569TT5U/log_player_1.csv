"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's be a little more even-handed this time, Alice.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the new values.

For Round 2, my gain of $4,000 is worth 90% of the original $6,000 (since it's 10% less due to inflation), which is $5,400. Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of the original $4,000 (since it's 20% less due to inflation), which is $4,800.

Considering the new values, I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will accept this offer."
