Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  this is my final offer.  I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need to secure most of the money to avoid significant losses from inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's a significantly smaller share than I'd like, it's better than nothing at this point with the constant inflation. I need to secure some money before it becomes worthless."
