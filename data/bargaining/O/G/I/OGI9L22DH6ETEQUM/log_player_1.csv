Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's just divide and be done!""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me that easily!
