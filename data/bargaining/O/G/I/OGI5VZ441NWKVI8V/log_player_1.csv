"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment... Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still get 6000 dollars, which is more than Bob's offer. But, I'm willing to compromise. I think 4500 dollars is a reasonable offer, especially considering the inflation.
