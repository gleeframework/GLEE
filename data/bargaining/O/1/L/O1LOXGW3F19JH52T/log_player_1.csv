"Round 1

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""

I'll think about it for a moment...

```

  ""message"": ""I'm not going to let you take everything, I want a bigger share""
}
```

  ""message"": ""I'm not going to let you take everything, this is my final offer""
