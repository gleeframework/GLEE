"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. Let's see if he accepts or rejects!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to be more aggressive now that he's seen my initial offer. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an equal split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share of the money and giving Bob enough to make the game worthwhile for him. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
