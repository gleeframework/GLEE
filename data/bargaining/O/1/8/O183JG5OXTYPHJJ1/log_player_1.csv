"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, Bob's share is worth 20% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer!"

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A compromise that's closer to the original 50/50 split.""
