"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll calculate my gain accordingly. My gain of 450,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is 0.95 \* 450,000 = 427,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
