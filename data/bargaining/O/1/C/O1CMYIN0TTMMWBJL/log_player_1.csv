"Round 1

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000.  This way we can both get a decent chunk of the money in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'll offer Bob 200,000, which is still a decent amount for him after the inflation, and I'll take 800,000.  I'm hoping this offer is more appealing than his previous one."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob is offering me more than in the previous round, it's still significantly less than what I could potentially get if we keep negotiating.  I'm not willing to settle for such a small share yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 700,000, but I believe this is still a fair deal considering the ongoing inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than the previous rounds, I'm still not satisfied with this split, especially considering the substantial inflation rate.  I believe I can get a more equitable share if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000.  The inflation is really taking a toll, so I'm trying to be more flexible to avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation is hitting hard, but I think I can get more than 400,000 if we keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We are both losing a lot of money with each round due to inflation. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to ensure we both get something.  It's the best way to maximize our gains given the situation."
