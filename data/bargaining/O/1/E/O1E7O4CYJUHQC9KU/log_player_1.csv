"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

 I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000.  This is a fair starting point, as it ensures a significant advantage for me while still giving Bob something.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  If I reject, the next round will have even lower value for Bob, making him less likely to compromise.  A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
