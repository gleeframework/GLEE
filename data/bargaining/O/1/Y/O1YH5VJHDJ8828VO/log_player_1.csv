"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30 and take 70.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way we both get a good deal and can move on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation.

In the second round, the total amount of money is still $100, but its value has decreased due to inflation. Since my gain is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my gain accordingly.

Let's calculate the effective value of the money:

Original amount: $100
Inflation: 10% less for me, 20% less for Bob

My gain: 50, but its value is 10% less than the original 50, so I'll consider it as 50 * 0.9 = 45

Bob's gain: 50, but its value is 20% less than the original 50, so I'll consider it as 50 * 0.8 = 40

However, the offer is to split it evenly, so we'll both get 50. Considering the inflation, I'll consider the effective value of the money as follows:

My gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
Bob's gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

Since I'll get $45 and Bob will get $40, I'll accept this offer.
