"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

Please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fairer, considering you'll be getting the full amount in every round. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 49/51 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects this offer."
