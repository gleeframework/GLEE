"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you 300k. It's a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening gambit to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering your offer wasn't very generous.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's counteroffer is a bit more generous, but I'm not ready to give up yet. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced a 60/40 split is fair, especially since I made the first offer. I'll wait for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and the money is worth less and less with each passing round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at 60/40? I think this is a fair split, considering the money is worth less now.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
