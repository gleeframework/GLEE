"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me taking $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'll give you a chance to accept a higher amount now, rather than waiting for the money to devalue further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a better deal than what I initially proposed, and it's still a 50-50 split, albeit with less value due to inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
