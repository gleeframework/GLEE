"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor for you. Let's see what you think! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a very unfair offer in the first round, as Bob is only getting 10% of the money.  Bob should reject and see if Alice is willing to be more fair in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start, and avoids any further risk from inflation.""}
