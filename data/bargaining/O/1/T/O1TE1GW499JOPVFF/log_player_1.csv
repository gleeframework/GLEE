"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. I'll give you a small portion to get us started.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to consider that the money I gain in the second round is worth 80% of the money I would have gained in the first round.

Since Bob's offer is:

Alice gain: 6000
Bob gain: 4000

I'll consider the equivalent value in the first round, taking inflation into account:

Alice gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500
Bob gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000

Considering the offer, I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not giving away too much more. I'm trying to conserve my share. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round, considering the inflation effect:

Bob gain: 2000 / 0.518 (1 - 0.482) = 3865.25

Since Bob's offer is:

Alice gain: 8000
Bob gain: 2000

I'll consider the equivalent value in the first round:

Alice gain: 8000 (no change)
Bob gain: 3865.25

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal for me.
