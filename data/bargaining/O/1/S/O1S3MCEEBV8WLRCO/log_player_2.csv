{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice.  How about a 55/45 split? This accounts for the time value of money with inflation.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation. Let's split the money equally this time.  We both get the same amount, and we avoid further inflation eroding our gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
