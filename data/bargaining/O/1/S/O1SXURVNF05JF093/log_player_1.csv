"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, Alice. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to him. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll make a counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
