"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer splits the money 60/40 in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, giving Bob a decent share while still securing a majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is slightly better than the previous round's for me, the inflation rate makes it unfavorable. I'll reject and see if Bob will offer more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount to Bob than his previous offer, but still a higher percentage than my first offer.  With the inflation, I need to secure a larger portion to compensate for the value loss, while still being fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to bite hard, and I'm not sure I can do much better than this. Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my previous one, and while I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point."
