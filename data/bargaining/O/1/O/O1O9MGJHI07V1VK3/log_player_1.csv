"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more even split to see how inflation affects us. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  If we both agree, we can avoid losing too much money. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
