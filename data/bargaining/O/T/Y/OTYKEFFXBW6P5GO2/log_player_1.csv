"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial amount, which is a relatively generous starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more careful. Since Bob's offer is still a bit higher than my initial offer, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 550,000 for him and 450,000 for me, and considering the inflation, I'll aim to counter with a slightly higher offer for myself. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a bit closer to a 50-50 split, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money! Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money is worth less and less with each round, I'll try to take a slightly better offer now, rather than risking waiting for a potentially worse one later. I'll accept this offer.
