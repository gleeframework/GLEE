"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Will you accept a slightly more generous offer? 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $20 is worth even less than I initially thought. And Bob's gain of $80 is still quite generous on his part.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'll decide to reject this offer. My goal is to get a better share, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50, it's a fair split!""
}
```"
