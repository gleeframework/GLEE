While I'm losing a lot of value with each passing round, it's better to take something than to risk getting nothing.  Bob's offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, but it's still a decent sum.  I'm not sure how much he's losing with inflation, but it seems he's still willing to compromise.  I'm willing to accept this offer to ensure that we both walk away with something, and I can try to make up for my losses elsewhere."
