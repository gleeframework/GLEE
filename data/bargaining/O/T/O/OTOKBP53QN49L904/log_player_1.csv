Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I propose 5500 for me and 4500 for you. We both get a decent amount, and we don't have to wait for the next round and risk further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
