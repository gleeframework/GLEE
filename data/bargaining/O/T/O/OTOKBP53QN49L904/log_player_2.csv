"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money over rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 70/30 split might seem fair in the context of the decreasing value of money, it's still significantly less than half for Bob.  It's worth seeing what Alice would offer in the next round, especially considering the inflation factor."
