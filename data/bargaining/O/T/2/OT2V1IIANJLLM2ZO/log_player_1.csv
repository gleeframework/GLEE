Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a fair split is closer to 55/45, given that I'm taking the inflation hit this round.  Let's get this done and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
