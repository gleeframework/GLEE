"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  This way we both benefit from dividing the money sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. It's fair on the surface, but I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm proposing we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a good deal for both of us, as we can get the money now and avoid the risk of inflation further decreasing our gains."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit to $5,500, leaving you with $4,500. This way we both still get a good deal before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option considering the inflation rate and the limited rounds remaining. I'm getting a decent amount, and delaying further risks losing even more."
