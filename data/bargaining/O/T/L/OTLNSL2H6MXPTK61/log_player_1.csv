Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering I will be the one taking the risk of being rejected and having to wait for Bob's proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  A 50/50 split is the best I can reasonably expect at this point, considering the risk of further rounds and decreasing value."
