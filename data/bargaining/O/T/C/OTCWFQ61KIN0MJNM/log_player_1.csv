"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 60/40""}

I'm proposing that I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable split, considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it evenly, but since you didn't go for that last time, I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I feel he's trying to take advantage of the fact that I didn't accept his offer in the previous round. I'll make a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to let you take the whole pie!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly this time!""}

I'm trying to be more conciliatory and propose a 50/50 split. I think this is a fair and reasonable compromise."
