"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be rational""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. Since we both want to maximize our gains, I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a reasonable offer and accept it, considering that the value of the money will decrease over time if we don't come to an agreement soon. My message, ""Let's be rational,"" is a hint to Bob that this is a sensible and efficient way to divide the money, and that prolonging the game would be mutually detrimental."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair, let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less now, I believe I can still get a better deal than an even split, considering my initial offer was more in my favor. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. Given that the money is now worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm trying to find a middle ground that is more favorable to both of us than the previous offers. My message, ""Meet me in the middle,"" indicates that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. I hope this offer is more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money."
