I'm playing as Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Alice will accept my offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is the best I've seen so far, considering the inflation.  It's a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure if I can do any better with the dwindling value of the money."
