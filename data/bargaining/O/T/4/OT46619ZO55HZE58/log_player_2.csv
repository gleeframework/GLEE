Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. This offer takes into account the diminishing value of the money for me, but still leaves us with a decent amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us considering the time pressure and the decreasing value for you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'd rather take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
