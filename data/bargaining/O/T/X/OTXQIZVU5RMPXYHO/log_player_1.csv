Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. Let's split it closer to 50/50 this time, but with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the offer now.  We can avoid further inflation and settle this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
