Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a risky move, but I believe it's the best way to maximize my potential gain in this game.  I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. If he doesn't, I'll adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not willing to settle for an equal split so early in the game. There are still many rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself. By rejecting this offer, I maintain the possibility of getting a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more reasonable, but still leaning towards my favor.  I'm increasing my offer to Bob, hoping he'll be more likely to accept it. I'm also taking into account the 20% inflation, so my offer is worth 7000 * 0.8 = $5600 in round 1 terms. This will hopefully be enough to convince Bob to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than I hoped for, it's important to remember that the money I gain is worth less with each passing round.  This offer, while not ideal, guarantees me a share of the money, and with the inflation rate, continuing to play risks losing everything.  I'll accept this offer to secure some gain."
