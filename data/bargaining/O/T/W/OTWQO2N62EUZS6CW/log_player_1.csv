"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a bold move, Bob! I'll take the whole 100 dollars, but I promise to split it with you if you can outbid me in the next round.""
}
```

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for a competitive negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and start with a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A more reasonable proposal from Bob!

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower value of the money.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
