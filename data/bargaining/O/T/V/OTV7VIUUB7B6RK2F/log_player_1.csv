"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 dollars for myself and giving 100,000 dollars to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose a 55/45 split, with me receiving 550,000 dollars and Bob receiving 450,000 dollars. This is a more balanced approach given the inflation and the fact that we're nearing the end of the game.  It's also a better outcome for both of us than a 50/50 split, considering the potential for further loss with more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While 300,000 dollars is not a terrible amount, it's still significantly less than what I could have received in earlier rounds.  I'm willing to risk further inflation to try to secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split, giving me 600,000 dollars and Bob 400,000 dollars. This offers a slightly higher share for me than the previous round, but still leaves a reasonable portion for Bob. The risk of further inflation is high, so it's important to reach a compromise before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a higher share, the risk of further inflation means I'm likely to get less in the next round.  Accepting this offer will at least ensure a decent amount of money for me."
