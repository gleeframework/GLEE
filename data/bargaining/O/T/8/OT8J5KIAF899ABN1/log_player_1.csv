"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, my share of $50 is equivalent to $45 in the original value. Bob's share of $50 is equivalent to $40 in the original value.

Considering this, I'll accept the offer.
