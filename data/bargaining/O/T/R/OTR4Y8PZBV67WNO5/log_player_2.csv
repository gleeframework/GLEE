Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and the previous outcomes, I propose a 72/28 split in my favor. This maintains a reasonable gap while still being fair, given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72
