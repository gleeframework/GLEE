I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob the entire $10,000. I think it's unfair and unreasonable, especially considering the reduced value of my share due to inflation. I've tried to negotiate a fair deal, but it seems like Bob is not willing to compromise.

At this point, I'm out of options and I'll have to accept the fact that I won't get a share of the money."
