Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair offer considering I'm not losing any value to inflation while Bob does.  Let's get this done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I'm still taking the majority.  It's clear Bob wants a larger share, but he needs to be more reasonable.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation affecting him."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  He needs to understand that the inflation is hurting him more than it's hurting me. I will continue to make reasonable offers, but I won't be swayed by his inflated demands."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too unreasonable. While he's losing money due to inflation, he needs to acknowledge that his demands are not sustainable in the long run. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a lopsided deal like this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering a slightly smaller share for myself to show my willingness to compromise.  Bob's demands are becoming increasingly unreasonable, but I believe we can still reach an agreement. This offer considers the inflation but also ensures a fair share for both of us."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too unfavorable. While I understand the inflation is impacting him heavily, he needs to recognize that his proposals are not realistic.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for a deal that drastically favors him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

We're nearing the end of the game, and time is running out.  I'm making another concession, but it's crucial for Bob to be reasonable. This offer acknowledges the inflation affecting him but also ensures I receive a fair share. Let's make a deal before we both lose everything."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unreasonable, especially considering the inflation he is facing. It seems he is prioritizing maximizing his gains instead of reaching a fair agreement. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a deal that leaves me with such a small share. We need to find a compromise before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

We are running out of time. I'm making a significant reduction in my share to demonstrate my commitment to reaching a solution.  However, this is my final offer. Bob needs to accept or risk losing everything. This deal acknowledges the inflation he is facing but also ensures I receive a fair share.  Let's end this game with a reasonable compromise."
