Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. I'm willing to negotiate for a more equitable split, especially considering the impact of inflation on my potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a more balanced split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to frame the decreasing value of the money as a concession on her part, but her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor. I need to push for a better split while I still have some leverage."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting dangerous. While Alice is right about time being on her side, her offer is getting worse! I need to hold my ground and hope she starts negotiating more realistically."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be realistic 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is incredibly frustrating, but I can't accept such a heavily skewed offer. It's a massive gamble, but I'm hoping Alice will start panicking soon as we get closer to the deadline and will be more willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This is a compromise, and we're running out of time.  We both lose if this goes on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9

# Alice's message: You're almost out of time, don't be greedy 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is terrible, but I have no choice.  Alice is clearly willing to run out the clock, and any money is better than nothing at this point."
