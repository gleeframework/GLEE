"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. I'm open to adjusting the split in future rounds if Bob is not satisfied with this proposal. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" conveys my intention to find a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more balanced split that accounts for the time value of the money. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, his gain of $5500 is actually worth 20% less than its face value, making it equivalent to $4400 in real terms. Meanwhile, my gain of $4500 remains unchanged. Given this, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced split""}\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that takes into account the 20% decrease in value for Bob's gain due to inflation. By offering him $4200, I'm effectively offering a more balanced split in real terms, as his gain would be equivalent to $3360 in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This is a reasonable offer that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the cumulative inflation effect, his gain of $5200 is actually worth 48.8% less than its face value, making it equivalent to approximately $2665 in real terms. Meanwhile, my gain of $4800 remains unchanged. Given the significant decrease in Bob's gain due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Time is on my side, be reasonable""}\n\nI'm making another offer that takes into account the increasing effect of inflation on Bob's gain. By offering him $3800, I'm effectively offering a relatively better deal in real terms, considering his gain would be equivalent to approximately $1950 in the first round. I'm trying to convey that time is working in my favor, and Bob should consider accepting this offer before the value of his potential gain decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob is offering a 50/50 split, the inflation has significantly reduced the real value of his gain. His $5000 gain is actually worth approximately $1640 in real terms, considering the 67.23% decrease in value. Meanwhile, my gain of $5000 remains unchanged. Given the substantial difference in the real value of our gains, I don't consider this a fair offer and will reject it, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, be realistic""}\n\nI'm making another offer that takes into account the severe effect of inflation on Bob's gain. By offering him $3000, I'm effectively offering a relatively better deal in real terms, considering his gain would be equivalent to approximately $985 in the first round. I'm trying to convey that time is working strongly in my favor, and Bob should consider accepting this offer before the value of his potential gain decreases even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This is a compromise, and we're running out of time.  We both lose if this goes on. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Although Bob is trying to convey a sense of urgency and compromise, the inflation has drastically reduced the real value of his gain. His $4500 gain is actually worth approximately $942 in real terms, considering the 79.03% decrease in value. Meanwhile, my gain of $5500 remains unchanged. Given the substantial difference in the real value of our gains, I don't consider this a fair offer and will reject it, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round. {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""You're almost out of time, don't be greedy""}\n\nI'm making another offer that takes into account the extreme effect of inflation on Bob's gain. By offering him $2500, I'm effectively offering a relatively better deal in real terms, considering his gain would be equivalent to approximately $523 in the first round. I'm trying to convey that time is almost up, and Bob should consider accepting this offer before the value of his potential gain becomes nearly worthless."
