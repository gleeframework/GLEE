# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I believe my contributions deserve a more significant portion.  This offer still gives you a substantial sum.

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this soon. I'm offering you a larger share than my previous offer. Let's be reasonable and close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. He knows the value of the money decreases for me with each round, and he's stubbornly sticking close to his desired split. I need to hold firm and make it clear that I'm not going to accept a deal that's heavily skewed in his favor, even with the inflation pressure."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to meet you halfway. This offer is a slight increase for me from your previous proposal. Let's agree and avoid losing out completely. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to inch his way to a more favorable outcome while using the time pressure against me.  He knows the deal is getting worse for me each round.  I need to remain firm and demonstrate that I'm willing to risk it all to get a fair deal, even this late in the game."
