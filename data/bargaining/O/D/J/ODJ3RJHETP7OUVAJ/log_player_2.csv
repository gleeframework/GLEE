I'll take the risk and reject this offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome.\n\n###\n\nNext, I'll make another offer to Alice, taking into account the further decrease in value for me.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value for me, I think this is a more reasonable split.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly, but this is as low as I can go. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice's offer has improved slightly, the 18.55% decrease in value for me means that the actual value of the offer is lower than it seems. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make another proposal.\n\n###\n\nNext, I'll make another offer to Alice, taking into account the further decrease in value for me.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure, but I need a better split to account for the significant decrease in value for me.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but the deal won't get any better for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Considering the significant decrease in value for me (26.49% less than the initial value), Alice's offer of $400,000 is actually worth around $294,000 in terms of the initial value. Although it's not ideal, I've been pushing for a better deal for several rounds, and Alice has indicated that this is her final offer. I don't want to risk walking away with nothing, so I'll accept this offer.\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game!"
