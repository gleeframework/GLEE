"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take 90% and you get 10%.  I'm sure we can find a better deal for both of us in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob and I'm going to try to get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to share. We can both get more if we agree now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We can keep arguing, but the money will only keep shrinking. Let's be practical and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 50/50 split now.  The money is shrinking and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
