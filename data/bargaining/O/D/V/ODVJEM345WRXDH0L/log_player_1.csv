Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My gains are worth 10% less, but Bob's gains are worth 20% less. This means if we reject and continue, my next offer will need to be even more generous to Bob, further reducing my potential gains.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 12 rounds, accepting this offer gives me a decent chunk of the money while avoiding the risk of losing everything due to continued rejections and inflation.

It's a calculated risk, but in this scenario, accepting seems like the most logical choice."
