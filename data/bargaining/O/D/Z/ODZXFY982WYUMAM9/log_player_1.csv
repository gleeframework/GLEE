"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can propose next!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal than Alice, don't pass it up! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 60:40 split, which is better than my initial 80:20 offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60:40, I'll try to counter with a 55:45 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You said you'd give me a better deal, but this is still a good one!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50/50, a fair deal, no games! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Bob's offer of a 50:50 split is a good one, but I'm not sure if I should take it. I've been trying to negotiate for a better deal, and I'm not sure if I'm getting the best possible outcome.

However, considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially better offer that might not materialize. I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 50% split.
