# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a good offer, considering the rapid devaluation of the money. 90% of the remaining value is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and risk losing even more value due to inflation."
