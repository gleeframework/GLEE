"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
