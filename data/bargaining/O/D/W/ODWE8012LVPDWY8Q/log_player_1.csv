I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept a smaller share in the first round, especially since his money is depreciating less quickly than mine. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a 10/90 split, which is the complete opposite of my first offer. While my money is worth 10% less than before, Bob's money is only 5% less. I'm still in a better position than him in terms of inflation, and I'm not going to settle for such a small share so early in the game. I'm going to counter his offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to push for a 70/30 split in my favor. Even though my money is now worth 10% less than in round 1, I'm hoping Bob will recognize that my offer is more fair than his, and that continuing to fight will just further decrease the value of the money for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly playing hardball!  His offer is even worse than the previous one, giving me only 30% and himself 70%.  While my money is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'm still in a better position than him.  He is losing value faster and if we keep going, it could backfire.  I'm going to make one more counter offer before I'm forced to take a deal I don't like."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is my last stand. The money is worth significantly less now, and if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk getting nothing. I'm offering an even 50/50 split. It's fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept and end this game before we both lose more."
