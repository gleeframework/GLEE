"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're leaving me with too little, let's give me a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 3000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
