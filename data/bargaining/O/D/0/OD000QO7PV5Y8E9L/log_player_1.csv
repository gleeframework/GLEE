Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the circumstances and the impact of inflation, I believe a 60/40 split is a fair adjustment for both of us. It's time for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, the inflation has significantly devalued Alice's potential gains.  While she'd prefer a more even split, accepting the 40/60 offer is the best way to secure *any* money at this point."
