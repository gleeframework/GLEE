"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a generous cut considering the time pressure and the fact that I'm taking on the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but this offer is still more equitable considering the inflation risk you're taking.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. This is my final offer before I have to prioritize minimizing my losses over maximizing gains. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While it's less than I'd hoped for, with each passing round the potential gains for me decrease while Bob's losses increase. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a substantial amount before the value drops further."
