Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'll start by rejecting Alice's offer. There's plenty of time left, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I believe it's a fair offer, considering I'm taking the risk of having to deal with inflation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Alice's offer again.  The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to a 50/50 split if we keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split this time. Inflation is starting to bite, but I think it's time to see if Alice is willing to compromise for a fair and equal division."
