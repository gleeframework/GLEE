"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'm starting low. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 2,000 to 8,000 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be worth 10% less than in the previous round. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 2,000 to 8,000, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""You started low, I'll meet you in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25-75 split, with me getting $2,500 and Bob getting $7,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You met me in the middle, I'll try to meet you below it! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. I think 4,500 is a good compromise, and I'd rather take this deal than risk going to the next round."
