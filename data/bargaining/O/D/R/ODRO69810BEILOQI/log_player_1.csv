"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to overcomplicate things!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get $400,000, which is a decent amount. However, I'm not happy about giving Bob $600,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new one in the next round. My goal is to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me than the 50/50 split from the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer again! The money is worth 14.26% less for him, but I'm still getting $450,000, which is a decent amount. However, I'm not happy about giving Bob $550,000.

I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that my money is worth the same as in the first round, while his is worth less due to inflation. I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new one in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's go back to a 50/50 split, considering the inflation factor this time""}

I'm proposing another 50/50 split, taking into account the fact that Bob's money is worth less due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
