"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4500 is actually worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is 4500 * 0.9 = 4050.

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I think it's a decent offer considering the circumstances. I'd rather accept this offer and get some money than continue playing and risk getting a worse deal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
