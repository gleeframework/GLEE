"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous deal. I'm happy to take a smaller share if you're willing to continue this game together.  
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a risky move, but Bob is going to try for a better deal. 10,000 is a pittance compared to the potential of a million dollars!  He'll see what he can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  Let's split the money more evenly this time.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further. Let's split the money closer to 55/45. This is a fair deal that ensures we both get a significant portion, and I'm confident we can work together to make it happen. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob has been trying to push for a better deal, but Alice seems determined to keep the majority of the money. It's getting riskier with each round, so Bob accepts this offer. It's a lot more than 10,000, and there's no guarantee he'll do better in the future rounds."
