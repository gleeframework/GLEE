I'm proposing a 90/10 split, giving me $9,000 and Bob $1,000. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be ready to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take something, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500.  While the inflation is starting to bite, I believe a more even split is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize that."
