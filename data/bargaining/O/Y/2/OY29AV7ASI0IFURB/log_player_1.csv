"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, while still leaving Bob with a smaller but decent amount. This should make it tempting for him to accept, as he would be getting more than nothing and the risk of the next round is high for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is a significant drop from my previous offer, the inflation will hurt Bob more than me. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my proposed gain by 200,000, which is less than the inflation hit Bob took. However, I'm still keeping a majority of the money. This offer is a risk for Bob, as inflation will significantly diminish the value of the money he receives in the next round if he rejects this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has eroded the value of the money significantly, it has impacted Bob more severely.  This offer gives me a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome considering the circumstances. Accepting ensures that I don't lose even more due to further inflation."
