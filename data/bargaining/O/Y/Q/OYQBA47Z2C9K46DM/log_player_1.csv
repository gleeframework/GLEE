"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm facing inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to flip the script and make a similar offer to the one I made in the first round, but with the larger share going to him.

I'll consider his offer, but I'm not convinced that I should take a smaller share just because of inflation. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was similar to mine in the first round, I'll try to make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to me. I'll take a bit more than 60% of the original amount, but not so much that it's unreasonable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise is key. I'll take a bit more, but let's keep it reasonable.""
}
```"
