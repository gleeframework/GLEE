"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nMy offer is 55 dollars for me and 45 dollars for Bob. I'm trying to be a bit generous while also taking into account that I'm the one who made the first offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can end the game quickly before the money loses its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer because, although it seems fair at first glance, the inflation mechanic means that my $50 is actually worth less than Bob's $50. Since I'm the one who's losing value over time, I think I should get a bit more to compensate for that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a bit more""}\n\nMy offer is 57 dollars for me and 43 dollars for Bob. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'm trying to take that into account and adjust the offer accordingly. I'm hoping Bob will understand the reasoning behind this and accept the offer before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but let's try to avoid further rounds. It's not good for either of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer because, even though Bob is trying to give me a bit more, the amount I'm getting is still not enough to compensate for the loss in value due to inflation. At this point, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I need to take that into account when considering the offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

At this point, the money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round due to inflation, so I'm trying to adjust the offer to account for that loss in value. I'm hoping Bob will understand the impact of inflation on my share and accept this offer before the money loses even more value."

At this point, the money I gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so I need a much bigger share to make up for that loss. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation is crippling my share, I need a much bigger cut""}\n\nMy offer is 65 dollars for me and 35 dollars for Bob. At this point, the money I gain is worth almost a quarter less than in the first round due to inflation, so I'm trying to adjust the offer to account for that significant loss in value. I'm hoping Bob will understand the severe impact of inflation on my share and accept this offer before the money loses even more value. If we don't reach an agreement soon, the money might become almost worthless to me."

# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer because, even though Bob is trying to give me a larger share, the amount I'm getting is still not enough to compensate for the substantial loss in value due to inflation. At this point, the money I gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round, so I need an even bigger share to make up for that loss. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. The pressure is mounting, but I'm hoping Bob will understand that I'm fighting against the clock and the crippling effects of inflation on my share."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Last chance, I need a huge share to offset inflation""}\n\nMy offer is 70 dollars for me and 30 dollars for Bob. At this point, the money I gain is worth a substantial amount less than in the first round due to inflation, so I'm trying to adjust the offer to account for that enormous loss in value. I'm hoping Bob will understand the dire situation I'm in and accept this offer before the money loses even more value. If we don't reach an agreement soon, the money will be almost worthless to me, and I'll be forced to walk away with nothing. This is my last-ditch effort to salvage what's left of the money's value."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept this offer because, at this point, the money I gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round due to inflation. Although the offer isn't ideal, I've realized that holding out for a better deal is no longer feasible. The risk of walking away with nothing is too great, and I need to salvage what's left of the money's value. Bob's offer of 30 dollars for me and 70 dollars for him is not what I wanted, but it's better than getting nothing. I'm choosing to accept this offer and end the game before the money loses any more value."
