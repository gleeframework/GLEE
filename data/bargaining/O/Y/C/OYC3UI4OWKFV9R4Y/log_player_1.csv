"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me since I'm the one making the proposal. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer, considering the money is worth less now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much. You're still getting a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value fast!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a good deal for me, considering the money's decreasing value. I'd rather take this offer and end the game than risk waiting for a better one."
