"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get it over with. I'll take the whole $100.""
}
```

This is a pretty straightforward offer, but I'm sure Bob won't accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. Each gets $50. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. And splitting the money evenly seems like a reasonable proposal. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
