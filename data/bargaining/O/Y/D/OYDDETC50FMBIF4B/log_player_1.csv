"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation, or we'll both lose!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. This division is slightly in my favor to account for the fact that each round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer by pointing out the mutual loss we'll incur if we don't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, considering the inflation, but we need to be quick to avoid losing too much! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for himself seems reasonable, especially since the money's value decreases more for him. Given the circumstances and the pressure to reach an agreement before the value drops further, I decide to accept Bob's offer to ensure we both receive a significant amount without risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.
