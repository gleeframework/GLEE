Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the same deal you offered in round one.  I'm willing to accept it now, understanding the pressure of inflation on your end. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000

Although it's less than what I wanted, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the best option at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Due to inflation, the value of my potential gains is decreasing significantly each round. Waiting any longer will only erode my share further.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has shown he's willing to accept the 60/40 split he initially rejected.  It's unlikely he'll agree to a significantly better deal for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. If I don't secure a better deal in the next round, I'll be forced to accept even less due to inflation. 

Taking the 60/40 split now guarantees me a reasonable share, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
