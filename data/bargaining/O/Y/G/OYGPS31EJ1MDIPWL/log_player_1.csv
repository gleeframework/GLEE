"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$. This way, I'll get 80% of the initial amount, which is a decent starting point for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 10$ is worth even less than I initially thought. I'm not thrilled about the 90-10 split, but I think I have to be more aggressive in my proposal since Bob is starting strong.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly better share this time, but still leaving room for negotiation."
