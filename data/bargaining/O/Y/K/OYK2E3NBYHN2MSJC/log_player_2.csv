"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I want most of the money since we have limited time! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair in the first round, I'm hoping to get more than $1000. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about the money losing value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get more than half since the money is losing value for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, Alice's offer is a fair compromise considering the inflation and limited time. Accepting this offer ensures we both get a substantial share of the money."
