"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my gain of 4000 is now worth 4000 / 1.1 = 3636.36.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is worth 20% less now (10% less from the first round and another 10% from the second round), my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2400,
  ""bob_gain"": 7600
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the money I would gain in this offer. The original amount of $4500 would be worth 4500 / 1.271 (10% less from the first round and 27.1% less from the second and third rounds) = 3537.85.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
