"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 55% and you get 45%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, with me taking the larger share this time. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55-45 split, even if I'm taking the smaller share this time. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 49-51 split?""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
