Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split seems a bit too favorable to you, Alice. Let's meet in the middle - a little more for me this time, and we can both avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
