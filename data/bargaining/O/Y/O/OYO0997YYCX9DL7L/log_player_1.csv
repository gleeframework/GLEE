"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to test his willingness to accept a low offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 7000 is worth even less than I initially thought. I'll think carefully about this offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to put pressure on him to accept or risk losing out on a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original $10,000, I need to be careful.

Considering the offer, I think I'll take it. The difference between 7500 and 2500 is smaller than I'd like, but it's still a decent split, and I'm worried that if I reject it, the next offer might be even worse.
