"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's see if I can get a better deal.  It's worth testing the waters and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need more to make it worthwhile for me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can achieve a more balanced outcome. Let's aim for a 60/40 split in favor of fairness. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing after 12 rounds. The inflation is starting to hit hard, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
