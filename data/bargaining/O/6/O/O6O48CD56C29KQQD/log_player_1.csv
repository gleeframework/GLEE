"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward division. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly lower share, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since Bob's offer is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd rather not accept a lower share than I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a bit more.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is worth 48.8% less than the original amount, which is a significant reduction. I'll think about it...

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's still a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
