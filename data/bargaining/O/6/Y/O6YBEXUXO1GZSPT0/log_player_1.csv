I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I figure this is a good starting point, as it gives him a small amount while leaving the majority for me. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's true that inflation has decreased the value of the money, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I was initially proposing.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob. This is still a fair deal considering inflation has reduced the value of the money for both of us, and I think it gives Bob a better chance to get something than his last proposal."
