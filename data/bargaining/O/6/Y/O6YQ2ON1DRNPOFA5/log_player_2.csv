# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer. Even though it's a ""fair"" starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn again. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still not convinced. I'll make another counter-offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm sticking with my previous proposal - a 65/35 split is fair, and I believe we can reach an agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up yet. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is clearly getting desperate, and with the inflation hitting hard, I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I'll take the 70/30 split.  It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing!"
