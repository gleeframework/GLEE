This is a very aggressive offer, but I'm aiming to get the majority of the money quickly. I figure Bob might accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than mine, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. It's risky to accept right now because I know the inflation rate is affecting Bob, and it's possible he'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999900, ""bob_gain"": 100}
```

I'm going to try to stay ahead of the inflation curve by offering slightly less than Bob's previous offer, but still significantly more than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to make him reconsider, but not so much that he feels he can get a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to see how much further his offer deteriorates before considering accepting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering slightly less than Bob's previous offer, but still significantly more than my initial offer. I'm hoping that by offering slightly less, I can make him think that I'm willing to walk away from the deal, and therefore encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still getting worse, and the inflation is starting to seriously affect him. I'm confident I can still get a better deal. I'm going to wait and see if he gets desperate enough to offer me more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 990,000 for myself and 10,000 for Bob. Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and I'm aiming to take advantage of his desperation. I believe this offer is close enough to his previous offer to make him consider accepting it, especially with the growing impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

# Alice gain: 30000 
# Bob gain: 970000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm going to see if he gets desperate enough to offer me more. The inflation is really hitting him hard now, so I'm in a strong position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 980000, ""bob_gain"": 20000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but this time I'm going to try and be more cautious. I'm offering 980,000 for myself and 20,000 for Bob. I'm aware that the inflation is really impacting Bob, but I don't want to risk losing the game. I'm hoping this offer is good enough to get him to accept, but I'm also prepared to make another offer in the next round if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40000 
# Bob gain: 960000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still getting worse, but I'm going to hold out for a better deal. I'm confident that I can get at least 950,000. The inflation is really hurting Bob, and he's likely to get desperate soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 970000, ""bob_gain"": 30000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm confident that the inflation is hitting Bob hard enough that he'll accept this deal. This is a good balance between what I want and what he's likely to accept.  I'm willing to risk one more round if necessary, but I think this will be enough to secure a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not as ideal as I had hoped, I'm concerned about the risks of another round.  With the inflation hitting Bob so hard, there's no guarantee he'll offer me more, and I risk getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement.  It's time to take the deal and secure at least some of the money."
