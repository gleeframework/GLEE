"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling more generous than you. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:**  Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor. By rejecting it, we signal that we're willing to play the game and wait for a better deal.  This puts pressure on Alice since her share diminishes faster with each round.
* **Appearing Reasonable (But Not Too Much):** Offering a slight majority for myself (55%) seems fair on the surface while still giving me a significant advantage. 
* **Framing:**  By describing the offer as ""generous,"" I try to subtly influence Alice's perception and make her more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'm feeling generous and think a 50/50 split makes the most sense.  Let's end this and take what we can. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, waiting any longer will only result in a smaller pot for both of us.  The money is losing value quickly, especially for Alice.
* **Alice is Getting Desperate:** Her offer, framed as ""generous,"" suggests she's feeling the pressure of the decreasing value and wants to settle quickly.
* **A Bird in the Hand:** It's better to secure a guaranteed $5,000 now than risk getting a worse deal later as the money continues to lose value."
