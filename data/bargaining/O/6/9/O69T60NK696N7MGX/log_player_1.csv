"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $100, which is $30. This leaves me with $70, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new values, my $60 in this round is worth 90% of what $70 was in the first round, and Bob's $40 is worth 80% of what $30 was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a bit more favorable to me than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, my offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, but considering the inflation, I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
