Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, Alice. Let's be realistic. This offer gives us both a decent share while acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, time is ticking and our money is losing value. This is my final offer.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal.  We're running out of time, and this ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's important to consider the rapid inflation:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're already in Round 4, and the value of the money decreases significantly with each round.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I hold out hoping for a better offer, the impact of inflation might mean a future offer, even if seemingly better on paper, could be worth less overall.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share, whereas rejecting risks getting nothing at all if we can't agree in the remaining rounds.

A 50/50 split is fair in principle, and given the circumstances, it's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk ending up with nothing."
