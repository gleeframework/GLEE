Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a bold offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on before inflation kicks in! Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred my initial offer, Bob's counteroffer is still fair, especially considering the potential for future inflation.  I'll take the 5000 and be done with it."
