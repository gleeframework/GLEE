"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, but still leave Bob with a significant amount to keep the game interesting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting for a potentially worse offer later. I'll accept Bob's offer.
