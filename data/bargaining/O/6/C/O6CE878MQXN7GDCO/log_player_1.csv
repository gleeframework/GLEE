"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept in the first round, as the value of the money will decrease significantly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer means I'll get $5,000, which is better than the $7,200 I'd get if I rejected and then had to propose in the next round.  The inflation will have a bigger impact on me in subsequent rounds, so I'm taking the safe bet now."
