"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me since I risk losing more if the game continues. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to avoid losing more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair offer. If you reject, the money will be worth even less for you in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I can propose anything close to a fair split.  Accept this 50/50 offer, or we both risk losing out significantly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me as in the first round, but 19% less for Alice, this 50/50 offer is actually more advantageous for me than the initial offer. I'll accept this offer to secure my gain before the value of the money decreases further for Alice, which might prompt her to offer less in subsequent rounds."
