"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, which seems fair to me, considering I'll be the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist with the inflation rates!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the new offer, as it's not balanced enough. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation that's affecting the money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60:40 split, especially with the money's value decreasing due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's call it even!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a 50:50 split, which seems fair considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
