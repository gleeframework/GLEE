"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, giving me $700,000 and Bob $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $600,000 and Bob will take the $400,000."
