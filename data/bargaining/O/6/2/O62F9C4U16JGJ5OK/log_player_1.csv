Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We both lose if this goes on much longer.  Meet me in the middle and let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of Bob's share is eroding quickly. This makes him more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for another round might seem tempting, but there's no guarantee of getting a significantly better offer from Bob.  
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum. Further rounds carry the risk of Bob becoming even more resistant, potentially leading to a worse outcome in the long run."
