"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer because I'm getting less than I was initially offered in Round 1, adjusted for inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $520,000 and keeping $480,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the adjusted value of the money for me, taking into account the 48.8% reduction in value.

$450,000 is worth 51.2% of the original value, so I'll consider it as 0.512 * 450,000 = $230,400 for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a better deal for me than my previous offers, adjusted for inflation.
