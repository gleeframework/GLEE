"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the original amount. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but let's see if we can do better in future rounds 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the offer from Bob is actually equivalent to me getting $45 and Bob getting $45.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
