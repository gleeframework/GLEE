580000.0,420000.0,"I'll give you a bit more than last time, but I still think I deserve the bigger share",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Let's be reasonable. I'll take a 60/40 split, which is still fair considering the inflation. This way we both get something substantial.",Bob,4,

350000.0,650000.0,"We're getting closer to the end of the game, and inflation is only going to hurt us both more. Let's agree on a 65/35 split. It's the fairest we can do at this point.",Bob,6,

250000.0,750000.0,"We are running out of time! I'm offering you a 75/25 split, which is the most I can offer.  We need to agree now or we risk losing everything.",Bob,10,
