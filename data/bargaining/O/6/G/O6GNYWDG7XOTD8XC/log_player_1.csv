"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see the wisdom in accepting this offer and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to give up 50% of the money just yet. Let's see what else is on the table.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on the risk of rejection. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for compromise."
