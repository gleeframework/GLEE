"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer is designed to be fair while maximizing my potential gain. I'm offering Bob a small amount, but it's better than nothing.  I hope he'll accept, but if not, I'm ready to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, the 20% inflation makes this a much more reasonable deal for me.  I'm happy to accept and end the game with a decent share."
