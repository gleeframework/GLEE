"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to split it 50/50, but I was hoping for a bit more. However, I don't want to risk losing out on a potentially good deal, so I'll accept this offer.
