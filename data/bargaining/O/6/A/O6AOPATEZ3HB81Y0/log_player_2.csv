"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000.  We both lose if we wait too long. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself.  I know Alice is more sensitive to inflation, so I'll see if I can leverage that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  We're both losing money each round, so let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse with time, but so is the pot. Let's be reasonable, $5500 for me, $4500 for you -  a better deal than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I know Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation more than me, and I'll try to use that to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to give you $3000, but I need the rest.  This is a much better deal than waiting any longer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it down the middle before we both end up with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is really starting to bite. A 50/50 split is a good outcome, and better than risking getting nothing."
