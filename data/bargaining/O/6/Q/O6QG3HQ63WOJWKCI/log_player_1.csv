"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is worth only $320,000 in real terms. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide.

I'll reject this offer since I'd be giving up $80,000 ($400,000 - $320,000) in real value. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer in this round will be worth even less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive in this round, offering Bob a slightly lower share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! In real terms, my potential gain of $300,000 is worth only $156,000. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer since I'd be giving up a significant amount of value in real terms. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is really eating into my potential gains. Here's my new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my potential gains! In real terms, my potential gain of $250,000 is worth only $32,500. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not in a strong position.

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at the end of the 12 rounds.
