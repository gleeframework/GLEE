{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want a larger share due to the inflation that affects me more."

While I'm losing a lot of value, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll take my chances with another round."

```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping to find a compromise. The inflation is hitting me hard, and while I'm willing to concede a little more, I need a decent share to offset the losses."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's significantly less than my initial goal, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money I'm getting, and a 50/50 split is better than getting nothing in the next round."
