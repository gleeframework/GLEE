I'll reject this offer. I've been playing it safe and waiting for a better deal, but it seems like Bob is not willing to give me a fair share. With the value of the money decreasing so rapidly, I'm starting to think that I'll be left with nothing if I don't take this offer. However, I'm not convinced that 90% is enough, especially considering the value of the money has decreased so much.

Unfortunately, I've run out of rounds and I'll be left with nothing if I don't accept this offer. I'll reject it, and we'll both end up with nothing.
