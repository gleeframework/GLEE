Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly aggressive first offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me, knowing that the money will be worth less each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, it's better to take this 50/50 split than risk further rounds of inflation. I'm not sure how Bob's gains are affected, so it's safer to take the sure thing."
