I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to get this settled quickly. I'll take $9000, leaving $1000 for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my first proposal. While it's true inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic cut.  I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm going to try and find a middle ground. Since Bob seems to be focused on a more even split, I'll offer $7200 for myself, leaving $2800 for Bob.  It's a significant compromise, but I'm still trying to get a majority share."
