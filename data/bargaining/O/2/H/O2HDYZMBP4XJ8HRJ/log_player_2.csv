Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing impact of inflation, let's adjust the split to be more future-proof but still fair. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. It's a better deal for me than the previous round, and the future uncertainty makes it hard to gamble for more."
