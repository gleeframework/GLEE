"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\nI will propose a division where I receive 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob receives 40%, which is $400,000. My message to Bob is: ""Let's divide fairly considering the future is uncertain.""

Here is my offer in JSON format:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly considering the future is uncertain.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the future inflation rates.  Let's be practical and end this early! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation and the offer made by Bob, I will reject this offer. The reasoning is that accepting this offer would give me $400,000, but this amount is worth 5% less than in the first round due to inflation. Moreover, Bob's gain is significantly higher, and his money is worth 20% less, which still leaves him with a substantial advantage. Rejecting allows me to propose a potentially more favorable division in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of money for both of us.

Here is my decision in JSON format:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the impact of inflation on both of our gains, I will make a new proposal. Given that the money I gain is worth 5% less and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less in each round, I should aim for a more favorable split to compensate for the future loss in value but also be mindful of the decreasing value for Bob to encourage acceptance.

My new proposal will be for me to receive 57% of the money and for Bob to receive 43%. The message to Bob is: ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, let's adjust the split to be more future-proof but still fair.""

Here is my offer in JSON format:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, let's adjust the split to be more future-proof but still fair.""
}
