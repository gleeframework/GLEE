,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Your offer was a good starting point, but I think this split is more reflective of the fact that I lose more money to inflation as the game progresses.  Let's settle this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's be reasonable here. We're both losing money with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I understand the need for fairness, but the longer this drags on, the more I lose. This offer provides a slight advantage for me to compensate for the inflation disparity. Let's be pragmatic and wrap this up.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"I'm willing to compromise. This split gives you a slight advantage, but it's better than continuing to lose money with each round. Let's end this now.",Alice,5,
