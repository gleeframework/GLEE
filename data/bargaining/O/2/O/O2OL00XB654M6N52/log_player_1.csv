"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous last round, but I'm not going to let you get the better deal twice in a row. I'm making a more balanced offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
