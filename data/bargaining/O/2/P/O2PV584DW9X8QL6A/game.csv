9000.0,1000.0,"Let's split it 90/10. It's a fair start, and I'm sure we can find a better compromise in the next round if you don't like this offer.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split. The money is still worth 100% to me, but it's worth 90% to you, so I'm willing to compromise.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to go down to 55/45.  Since the money is worth less to me with each round, I need to get a better share to make it worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Since the money is worth even less to you now, I'm willing to take a bigger share. I think 70/30 is a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to accept 40/60.  This is getting very close to the value of the money for me now, so I don't have much room to negotiate further.",Alice,5,
