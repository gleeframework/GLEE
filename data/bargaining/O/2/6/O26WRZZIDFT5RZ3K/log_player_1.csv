"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up too much of the potential gain, especially considering the inflation effect. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 1 due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $450,000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Let's compromise and meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant portion for myself, considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still being generous 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. However, since Bob is still offering a 50-50 split, I'll consider it a good opportunity to end the game. I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's better to take a fair share now than to risk getting less in future rounds due to the increasing inflation."
