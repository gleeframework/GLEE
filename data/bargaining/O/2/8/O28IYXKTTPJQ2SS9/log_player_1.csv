"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose you take $990,000 and Bob takes $10,000.  This ensures I get the vast majority of the money while still giving Bob a small amount to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to get more, Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation factor.  I'm better off taking half the money now rather than risking getting nothing in a future round."
