"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 70-30 split in favor of you, Bob. Let me know if you find this offer fair. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept this offer, but it's important to consider the potential for a better deal. The 70/30 split is good, but there's a chance I can get more with further negotiation, especially with the looming inflation."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
