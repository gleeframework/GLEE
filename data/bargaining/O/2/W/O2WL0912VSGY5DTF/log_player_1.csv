"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $9000 and Bob getting $1000.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. This seems like a game of power, and while I don't want to lose all the money, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic shift in favor of Bob. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. While I'm willing to compromise, I believe this is a fair reflection of our initial proposal.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking value, I'm not going to cave in to Bob's demands just yet. This offer is still too unfavorable to me.  I'll see what I can do with my counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  I believe this is the fairest outcome given the current situation.  Inflation is steadily eroding the value of our potential gains, so it's time to compromise and ensure we both receive something."
