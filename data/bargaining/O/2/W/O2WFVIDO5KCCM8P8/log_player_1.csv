"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{

Round 2

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of splitting it evenly, I'll have to consider the inflation factor. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting a higher amount now versus the potential loss of value due to inflation.
