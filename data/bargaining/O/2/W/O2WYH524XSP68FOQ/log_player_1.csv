Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. We both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm not as affected by the inflation as Bob is.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer for now. Let's see how things go from here!"
