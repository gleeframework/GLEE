"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept and we can shake hands!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to get a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's move forward with this, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, considering I was willing to offer you $100,000 in the first round. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my initial offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""
}
```"
