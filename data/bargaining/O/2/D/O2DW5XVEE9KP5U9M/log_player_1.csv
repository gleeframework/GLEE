Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's start with a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50/50 split because I'd like to get a slightly larger share, considering the inflation factor that affects Bob's gains more significantly. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
