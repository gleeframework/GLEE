"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, a good start, now it's your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking. With the current offer, I'd be getting 40, which is 40% of the total 100 dollars. Considering the inflation, I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, hoping to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm willing to give up a bit more to get a better share."
