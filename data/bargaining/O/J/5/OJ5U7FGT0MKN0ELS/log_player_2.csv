Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we both lose with every round. This offer is still advantageous for you, considering the decreasing value.

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it acknowledges the inflation affecting us both, but with a slight advantage to me to reflect the early risk I took.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is trying to anchor the negotiation in her favor.  While her offer acknowledges the decreasing value, it's still heavily skewed towards her.  We need to show strength and push for a more equitable split, even at this late stage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it - we're running out of time and both losing money!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The time for negotiation is rapidly dwindling. By round 6, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the initial sum.  A 50/50 split, while not ideal at this stage due to the uneven inflation rates, presents a clear and firm stance.  It signals to Alice that Bob is serious about reaching an agreement, but not at the cost of being exploited. This offer is a strong signal that Bob is willing to walk away if Alice doesn't agree, which might push her to accept a deal."
