# Bob gain: 5500

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it - we're running out of time and both losing money! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Delaying further significantly hurts both players.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if Alice manages to secure a slightly better deal in the next few rounds, the impact of inflation means the actual gain will be minimal.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:** Holding out for a significantly better offer is very risky.  Bob might dig in, and both players could end up with nothing.

A 50/50 split, while not reflecting Alice's initial advantage, guarantees a reasonable amount of money considering the circumstances.
