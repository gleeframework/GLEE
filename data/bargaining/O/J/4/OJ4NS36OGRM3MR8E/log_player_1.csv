Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Time is ticking, and the value diminishes with each round. This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
