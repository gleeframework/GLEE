"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, let's see if we can narrow it down from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he's willing to accept a small difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly for now 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain would be 8550 and Bob's gain would be 4500 if we were to accept this offer.

However, I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option, especially since I'm willing to negotiate further.
