"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share of $400,000 is now worth less than before, and Bob's share of $600,000 is worth even less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! With my share worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be cautious. Bob's offer is still a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money's value continues to erode due to inflation. With my share worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value! With my share worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very cautious. Bob's offer is a significant concession, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money's value continues to erode due to inflation. With my share worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to him, considering the inflation."
