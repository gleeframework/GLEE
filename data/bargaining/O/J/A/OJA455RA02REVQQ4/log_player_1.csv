"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's a good deal for both of us!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering the inflation penalty he'll face if he rejects it. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair share, but I need to plan for the future. How about a 55/45 split? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, I have no incentive to rush into an agreement. Additionally, Bob's offer of a 55/45 split is less favorable to me than my initial offer, and I believe I can negotiate for more. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""You didn't like my first offer, and I didn't like yours. Considering the inflation, I think this 65-35 split is more than fair.""
}
```

Since Bob's money is worth 20% less in each round, I'm taking that into account and adjusting my offer accordingly. I'm still willing to give him a significant share, but I believe I have the upper hand in the negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This back and forth helps neither of us. I propose a 50/50 split - it's the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Although Bob's offer of a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation factor. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, I'm not feeling the pressure of inflation like Bob is. In reality, Bob's 50% is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round, so I think I can still negotiate for a better deal. Let's keep going!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 5:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I understand your desire for a 50/50 split, but considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think this 70-30 split is more realistic.""
}\n\nI'm taking a firmer stance in this round, as Bob's share is now worth almost 50% less than its original value. I'm still open to negotiations, but I believe I have a strong position. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting out of hand.  I'm offering a 45/55 split. This is a compromise and a realistic offer considering the inflation.  Let's be logical and end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}\n\nAt this point, Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, and I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer of a 45/55 split is an improvement from his previous offers, but I think I can push for more. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I'm not feeling the pressure to settle. Let's continue negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I understand you think your offer is realistic, but with the inflation, your share is worth less than a third of its original value. This 75-25 split reflects the current situation.""
}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, I'm making an offer that takes this into account. I'm still open to negotiations, but I believe I have a strong position. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting absurd.  I'm offering you the 60/40 split you originally wanted.  Take it before inflation makes this entire endeavor pointless! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}\n\nFinally! Bob has come around to my original offer of a 60-40 split. Considering the massive impact of inflation on his share, I think this is a great deal for me. I'll take it before Bob changes his mind or inflation makes the deal even sweeter for me!"
