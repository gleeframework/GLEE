Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a 50/50 split, but considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think this 70-30 split is more realistic. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While a 30/70 split is terrible for me, accepting it at this point would be a terrible strategy.  It sets a precedent and shows her I'm willing to cave under pressure. I need to hold strong and hope she gets more reasonable."

Round 6

This is a compromise and a realistic offer considering the inflation.  Let's be logical and end this before we both lose out.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think your offer is realistic, but with the inflation, your share is worth less than a third of its original value. This 75-25 split reflects the current situation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting ridiculous. Alice is clearly trying to push me to the brink, but I still have some leverage. Accepting a 25% share would be a disaster. I need to show some backbone and hope she blinks before it's too late."
