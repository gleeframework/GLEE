Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 900,000:100,000 split.  It's a generous offer for Bob, considering his money will be worth less in the next round.  Let's see if he takes it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this offer is fair. I'm not sure how much longer the game will go on, and I'm not confident I could get a better deal in the next round.  It's a 50/50 split, and that's a good outcome."
