Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, my new offer is 58-42. It's a better deal for you than my first one. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My position gets worse with every round, and we both lose if we don't agree.  Meet me in the middle at 52-48.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to meet you in the middle. My new offer is 57-43. It's still a better deal for you than my first one, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the deal is getting significantly worse with each round. Accepting a 430,000 payout is better than risking another round and getting an even lower offer from Alice.
