# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below half 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a 50/50 split, Bob. Don't be greedy 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, getting $50 is better than risking getting nothing if the negotiations fail. Alice's offer is strategically timed to exploit the increasing pressure from inflation."
