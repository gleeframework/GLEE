"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less. Since I'm getting a larger share, I'll accept this offer.
