**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most rational choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Bob.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance I could get a slightly better deal in the next round. However, there's also a chance Bob will offer me even less, and the overall value will continue to decrease. 
* **Bob's Ultimatum:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer. There's a strong chance he's sticking to his guns, knowing the pressure is on me to accept something before the money is worth even less.

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting 55% now is better than risking a worse outcome later."
