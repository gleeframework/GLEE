"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 40% less than in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 46-54 split, especially since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 5, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and has been decreasing by a smaller percentage each round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, given the significant decrease in Bob's gain. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer because, although Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, it's still a relatively fair split considering the circumstances. I'm not sure if Bob's gain will continue to decrease at this rate, and I don't want to risk going to another round."
