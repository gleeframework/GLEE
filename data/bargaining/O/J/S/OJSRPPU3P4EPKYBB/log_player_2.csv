Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not going to let you take advantage of the situation. Let's split it fairly - 40 for me, 60 for you. It's a fair deal, and it'll avoid us both losing more money.  
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob was aiming for a higher split, accepting 60/40 in round 5 makes sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both players, especially Alice. Waiting longer significantly erodes the potential gains. 
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems unlikely to agree to anything worse than a 60/40 split in Bob's favor. She's willing to play hardball, knowing time is on her side.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks getting a worse deal or even nothing in the later rounds. Accepting ensures Bob gets a decent share."
