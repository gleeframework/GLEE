"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.
