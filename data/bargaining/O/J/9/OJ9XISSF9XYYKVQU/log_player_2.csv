Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant portion to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out.  This is my final offer - it's a reasonable split considering the circumstances.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up some ground, but I need more than your last offer. Let's find a solution before the time runs out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the time pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean I lose almost 20% of the initial potential value. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but her offer isn't moving nearly enough to warrant accepting yet.  I need to show I'm willing to walk away to get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This offer is fair and the most you'll get. Take it or leave it.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting impatient, Bob. This is my final offer. We need to compromise if we want anything at all. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The time pressure is immense now.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I'd get if we fail to agree. Accepting now cuts my losses and guarantees a payout before the inflation eats away at the potential gains any further."
