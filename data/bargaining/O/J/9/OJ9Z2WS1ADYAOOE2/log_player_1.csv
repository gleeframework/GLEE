"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, Alice. I think a 55/45 split is reasonable this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of my initial offer, taking advantage of the fact that the value of the money has decreased for me, but not for him. This is unfair. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be exploited."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we both want a larger share. How about we meet closer to the middle? This offer recognizes the time pressure we're both under.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  I'm moving closer to a 50/50 split to show a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that the value of the money is decreasing for me with each round, making it less likely I'll accept a heavily skewed offer later. 
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  By proposing 52/48, I'm avoiding an offer so close to 50/50 that it might be instantly rejected, while still moving in a direction that might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to end this now.  51/49 is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but ultimately it's the best option in a difficult situation:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer this goes on, the less money I'm getting. With each round, the inflation eats further into my potential earnings.
* **Bob's Stance:**  He's presented this as his ""final offer."" While this could be a negotiating tactic, there's a real risk he'll dig in his heels and offer even less next round. 
* **Slightly Better Than Even:** While not ideal, getting slightly less than half is better than the increasingly smaller amounts Bob is likely to offer as time goes on."
