"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the inflation will impact Bob's share more significantly in the following rounds. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer might seem tempting now, it's important to consider the long-term consequences. Rejecting his offer means I get to make the next proposal, and inflation will continue to erode the value of the money more for Bob than for me. By rejecting his offer, I maintain the leverage and can potentially secure a better deal for myself in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm proposing a division of $8,000 for me and $2,000 for Bob. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still reflects the reality of inflation and the fact that I'll get to make the next offer if this is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Inflation is really starting to bite, but I'm not going to cave in to Bob's pressure.  He's offering me a significantly smaller share than what he proposed in round 2, and I know that the more rounds we go through, the more the inflation will hurt him. I'll continue to try and negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly again, but still aiming for a significant share. Inflation is impacting both of us now, but I believe I can still secure a better deal than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy. While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I initially proposed, the inflation is hurting him much more than me. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on him and gives me a chance to make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but it's still a significant amount. The inflation is starting to catch up to me, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal than Bob's last offer.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but I'm still going to reject it.  Inflation is hurting us both significantly now, but it's still affecting Bob more. By rejecting his offer, I'm hoping to push him closer to a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're both taking a big hit from inflation now.  I'm proposing an even split to avoid further deadlock.  Let's finally end this."
