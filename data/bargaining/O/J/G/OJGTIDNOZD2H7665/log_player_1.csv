"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a strong offer that favors me, hoping Bob will accept.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try a compromise offer, slightly lower than my initial proposal but still favorable to me.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value of reaching an agreement before the inflation gets too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money.  A 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing in the end.  Let's accept this offer and end the game."
