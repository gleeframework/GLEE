"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but it is still fair in the sense that Bob gets something, and it allows for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I am offering Bob a slightly larger share than in the first round, but still keeping the majority for myself. This demonstrates that I am willing to compromise, but I also want to ensure I get a good share of the money."
