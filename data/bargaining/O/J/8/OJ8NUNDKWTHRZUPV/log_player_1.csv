I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money in the first round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, this offer is a fair split considering the inflation.  It's better to secure 5000 now than risk getting less in future rounds."
