"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, even if it's a compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

}
```
