"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 20%. I'm framing this as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice! Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal. The money is still worth a lot, and I'm not willing to settle for a 70:30 split just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 60:40 split in my favor, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal. The money is still worth a significant amount, and I'm not willing to settle for a 55:45 split just yet!"

}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, which is a fair compromise, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it!"
