I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money in the first round, knowing it will be worth less to me in the following rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, it's clear Bob is going to take the majority. If I reject, I'll get even less in the next round, due to inflation. Accepting is the best option at this point."
