"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20 dollars.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80 dollars and Bob 20 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't go too low, right? 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 70 dollars is worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round, which is equivalent to 74 dollars in the first round. Bob's gain of 30 dollars is worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round, which is equivalent to 18 dollars in the first round.

Considering this, I'll make a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 85:15 split, giving me 85 dollars and Bob 15 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think this is the best I can do. You're getting a good deal here! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of 75 dollars in Round 4 is worth 86.67% of what it would have been in the first round, which is equivalent to 86.67 * 80 = 69.33 dollars in the first round.
Bob's gain of 25 dollars in Round 4 is worth 72.9% of what it would have been in the first round, which is equivalent to 72.9 * 20 = 14.58 dollars in the first round.

Considering this, I'll make a decision.
