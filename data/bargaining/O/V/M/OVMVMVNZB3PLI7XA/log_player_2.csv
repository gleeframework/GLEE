**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, Alice is clearly trying to wear me down with minimal concessions. I need to hold firm to signal I'm serious about a fairer deal.  The closer we get to the end, the more pressure is on her, not just me."

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me, and Alice is barely budging. While this isn't a good deal, it's getting to the point where getting anything is better than nothing. If I reject this, she might not even offer me anything close to this in the remaining rounds."
