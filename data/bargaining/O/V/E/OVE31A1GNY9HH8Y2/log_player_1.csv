"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  I think that's the best way to ensure we both get something in the end. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not sure if an even split is the best strategy, given the decreasing value of the money. However, it's a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
