Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly playing a game of chicken, knowing the inflation is hurting me more than her. However, accepting this offer would mean I'm losing a significant chunk of the money.  I need to show I'm willing to walk away, even if it means getting a smaller share later."

{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alright Alice, you win.  This is me compromising to avoid getting nothing.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I need to signal to Alice that I'm serious about not getting zero. Offering her slightly more than half shows I'm willing to negotiate, but time is running out and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me!  While this offer isn't great, it's better than getting zero in the next few rounds. Alice is clearly willing to push this to the limit, and I need to cut my losses before the value diminishes even further."
