"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, trying to get Bob to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm not going to be too generous just yet. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Since the money is worth 5% less, my gain of 200,000 is actually equivalent to 190,000 in the first round. Not bad, but I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less due to inflation. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, and we can avoid further negotiations!""
}
```

This offer takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant one, hoping he'll accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up that much, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting the money's value, I'll have to recalculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round. 

Considering the 14.26% decrease in value for me and 48.8% decrease for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'll have to be more cautious and not give up too much. However, the offer seems more reasonable than the previous ones. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
