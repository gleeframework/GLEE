"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money I gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, since it's 20% less due to inflation. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting 500,000 * 0.8 = 400,000 dollars.

I'll accept this offer.
