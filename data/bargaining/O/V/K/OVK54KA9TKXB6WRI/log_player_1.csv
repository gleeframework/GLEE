Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal, or if he's aiming for a more even split.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get at least something.  The inflation factor makes it riskier to keep rejecting offers, and a 50/50 split is fair."
