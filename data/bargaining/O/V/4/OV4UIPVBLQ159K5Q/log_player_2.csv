Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's try this 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly increasing her offer to Bob, but at this rate, it will still take several rounds to get to a reasonably fair split. By continuing to reject, Bob signals that he is willing to hold out for a better deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but getting anxious 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure with the decreasing rounds, and her offer increments are getting smaller. Bob is in a strong position to hold out for a bit longer and aim for a more favorable split as the game reaches its later stages."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. We both know time is running out.  Take this offer and we both walk away with something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is on. Bob needs to make a strong move to shift the balance in his favor.  This offer is a calculated risk, as it tilts the scales significantly towards Bob. However, the message emphasizes the urgency of the situation and frames the offer as a way to avoid a lose-lose scenario."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Really, last chance for a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but with only 3 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very high.  Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, but it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. Accepting now guarantees Bob a decent share of the money, while continuing to play is a gamble that could leave him with nothing."
