Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous by not dropping my share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would ideally want more, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains significantly. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
