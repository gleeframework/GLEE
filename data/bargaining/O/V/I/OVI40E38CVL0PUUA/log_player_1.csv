I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping to secure the deal in the first round and avoid the inflation that's going to eat into my share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer is the best option. If I reject it, I'll have to make an offer in the next round, and with inflation, my share will be worth even less. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least something, even if it's significantly less than what I initially wanted."
