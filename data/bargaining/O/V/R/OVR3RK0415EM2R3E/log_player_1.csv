"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, trying to account for the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth significantly less, and Bob's offer seems more reasonable now.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $4,800 for myself and $5,200 for Bob. I think this is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
