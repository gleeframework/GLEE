"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this case, I'll decide to reject the offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 400,000 for me, and I rejected it, I'll try to increase my offer to 450,000, hoping Bob will accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go any higher.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I'm getting a raw deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rate is higher in round 4 compared to round 2, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than before.

Given that I rejected Bob's previous offer of 400,000, and now he's offering 300,000, which is a decrease, I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 300,000, and I rejected it, I'll try to go even lower, considering the increasing inflation rate. I'll offer 320,000, hoping Bob will accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but don't think I'm getting a great deal.""
}
