"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is my first offer. I'm taking the vast majority of the money, but leaving Bob with a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  Since the money inflates in his favor, he'll need to consider if he wants to wait and potentially get more, or accept this deal and get something now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by continuing.  While I could potentially get more if I reject, the inflation in Bob's favor makes it too risky."
