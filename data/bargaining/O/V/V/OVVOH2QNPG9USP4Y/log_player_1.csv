I'm starting with a 90/10 split.  I want to secure a large portion of the money, knowing inflation will impact future rounds. Let's see if Bob is happy with that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, I'm still getting a significantly larger portion of the money. I want to see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm lowering my gain slightly, but still keeping the majority.  I'm hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal than the previous round, while still keeping a good chunk of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting less than I initially hoped for, this is a significant improvement over the previous round. Inflation is hitting my gains hard, and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round. I'll accept this offer and secure at least something."
