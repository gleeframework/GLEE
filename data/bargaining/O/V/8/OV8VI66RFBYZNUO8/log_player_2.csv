Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with an 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This takes into account the potential inflation over future rounds.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it.  I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor.  It's a risk, but I'm willing to take it."
