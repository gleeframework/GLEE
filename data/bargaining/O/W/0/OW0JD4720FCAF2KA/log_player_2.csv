Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a more balanced approach. I'm willing to give up some of my share to avoid further rounds.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still in her favor. The inflation is starting to impact her more significantly, making her more likely to concede in later rounds. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
