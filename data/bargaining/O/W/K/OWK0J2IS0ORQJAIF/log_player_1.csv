"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting my proposal and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway and we can avoid more rounds! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You can't do better than this, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive and take a bigger share for myself, given the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! Be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less for me now, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. However, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than my previous one, considering the decreasing value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
