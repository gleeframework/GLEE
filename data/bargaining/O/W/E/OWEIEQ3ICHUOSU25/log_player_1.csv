Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

Even though I'd prefer a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage makes the most sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases substantially. Accepting now minimizes further losses.
* **Fairness:** Bob's offer is objectively fair. Holding out for a significantly better deal is risky and could lead to us both getting nothing. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer an equal or better split in future rounds.  

Accepting the current offer guarantees a reasonable and equal share of the money."
