"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is my initial offer. I want to take the majority of the money (9000$) since I am the one proposing. I'm giving Bob 1000$ to make it seem like a reasonable offer, but it's still heavily skewed in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation by offering me a much smaller share, even though I'm the one losing out due to the inflation effect on my money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 6000$, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer, considering the inflation effect on both of us.  I'm also hoping that he won't reject again and risk the possibility of getting an even lower offer in the next round."
