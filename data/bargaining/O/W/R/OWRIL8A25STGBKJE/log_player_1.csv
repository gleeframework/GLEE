"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, leaving Bob with $450,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm still confident I can do better next time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000 (10% less than 300,000)
* Bob gain: 700,000 * 0.95 = 665,000 (5% less than 700,000)

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value for me and 95% of its original value for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a step up, Bob! I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32/68 split in my favor, a slight increase from my previous offer. The message is a gentle nudge, encouraging Bob to consider a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share to make it worth my while! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: 400,000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = 291,800 (27.3% less than 400,000)
* Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.855 (1 - 0.145) = 513,300 (14.26% less than 600,000)

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more severely. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
