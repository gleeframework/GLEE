"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $7500 in this round is actually worth less than my initial proposal of $8000 in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more cautious this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer takes into account the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time."
