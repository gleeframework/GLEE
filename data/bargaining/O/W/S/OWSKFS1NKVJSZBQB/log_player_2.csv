"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 2000 for me and 8000 for her, I'll try to do better than that. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a slightly higher amount to myself.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, and Alice's gain is worth 36% less, I'll try to take that into account.

In the first round, I rejected an offer of 2000 for me and 8000 for Alice. Now, Alice is offering 4000 for me, which is 20% more than the initial offer. Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer.
