Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit lopsided Alice. Let's be more realistic.  This offer accounts for the time value of money.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This accounts for inflation and gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob.  Waiting longer means he gets even less.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal than an even split. She knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely.

While Bob might ideally want more than $5,000, accepting the even split ensures he gets something before inflation erodes the value further.
