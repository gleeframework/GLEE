"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it carefully. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a larger share of the money. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting less.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it carefully. With the increased inflation, Bob's share is actually larger than my share, but not as large as in the previous round.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
