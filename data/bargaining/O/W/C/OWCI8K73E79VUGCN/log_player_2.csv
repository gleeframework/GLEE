Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise. You get a good portion, and I get a decent amount while minimizing risk. Let's get this done before things get worse for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to frame her offer as generous, but it's important to look at the bigger picture. Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Time Pressure:** While there's time pressure on both of us, Alice is more affected by the inflation.  Her offer doesn't reflect this urgency.
* **Future Rounds:** I'm betting that Alice will be willing to make a better offer in the next couple of rounds as the inflation eats into her potential gains. 

Let's see if we can push for a more favorable split!"
