Alice's offer:

This is a terrible offer for Bob.  Even though he's getting something, it's far too little. It's better to reject and see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is slightly better than her first offer, it's still not a fair deal.  The inflation is hitting Alice much harder, so she's likely desperate for some money. I'm going to continue to reject until I get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly.  I'm hoping the inflation is making Alice more desperate for some money.  It's still a good deal for me, but I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and getting an agreement."
