"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is a fair offer in my opinion. 90/10 is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiations in future rounds. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good deal and accept it, but I'm prepared to be more generous if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much more equitable than my first offer. While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money, and with the inflation factor, I don't want to risk getting nothing."
