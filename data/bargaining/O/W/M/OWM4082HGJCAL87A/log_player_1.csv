"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each round, I should aim to get more in the earlier rounds. This offer is a 50/50 split, which is a good compromise.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
