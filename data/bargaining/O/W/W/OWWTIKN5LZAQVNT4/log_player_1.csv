"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. My message to Bob is that this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share this time.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, even if I'm the one getting the smaller share this time. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation is still affecting me, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 45-55 split""
}
```

My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise and meet him in the middle with a 45-55 split."
