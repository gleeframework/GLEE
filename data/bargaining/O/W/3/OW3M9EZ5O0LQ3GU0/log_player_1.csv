"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself. Since the money loses value for Bob with each passing round, I'm hoping he'll be incentivized to accept my offer early on. I've included a friendly message to set a positive tone for the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even, I'm willing to take the risk of the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I'd be giving up a significant amount of money compared to my initial proposal. Since the inflation doesn't affect me, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my share to $650,000 and offer Bob $350,000. Since Bob is affected by inflation, the value of the money he receives decreases with each passing round. I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes this into account, while still being favorable to me. I've added a message to remind Bob of the inflation factor and encourage him to accept my offer. Let's see how he responds!"
