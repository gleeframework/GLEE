"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to get a quick agreement and avoid any potential complications!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation rate.

For the second round, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll calculate the actual amounts as follows:

Alice gain: 4000 * 0.9 = 3600
Bob gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800

Considering the offer, I'll reject it since I'd rather wait for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation rate.

Since the money is worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%), I'll offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}"
