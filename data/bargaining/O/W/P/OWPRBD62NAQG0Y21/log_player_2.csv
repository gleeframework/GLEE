"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. This seems fair to me considering the inflation we're dealing with. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be reasonable, I'll take $60 and you get $40. This accounts for the inflation we both face.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical.  My last offer was generous considering the inflation. I'm willing to compromise at $65 for me and $35 for you.  Every round costs us both money. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while I'm taking significant losses each round. It's time to push for a more substantial change in her favor or risk getting even worse offers as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and this back and forth isn't beneficial for either of us. I'm proposing a more balanced split: $55 for me, $45 for you. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my offer again to $60 for me and $40 for you.  This is more than fair considering how much inflation is hurting your share.  Let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, my potential gains are dwindling rapidly due to inflation. Accepting $40 now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds, or even worse, walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
