"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and leaving $40 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'm actually gaining less than I initially thought. I'll think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, 52-48. Take it or leave it!""}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this revised offer, but I'm still trying to protect my own gain."
