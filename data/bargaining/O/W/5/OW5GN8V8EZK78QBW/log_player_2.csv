Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a bigger share.  Let's split it 80/20 this time.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's make a deal before it's too late.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money here.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a bigger share than 40%.  Let's split it 70/30, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to wear me down with the threat of inflation, but she clearly wants a larger share.  While the offer is better than her previous 80/20 proposal, I need to hold out for a better split. Accepting now would show weakness."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is too far.  This is my final offer - 55/45.  Take it or leave it, we're running out of time!"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time pressure is increasing.  This offer is a significant concession on my part, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable split. By stating it's my final offer, I'm hoping Alice recognizes the seriousness of the situation and accepts."
