"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This is a fair starting point, considering Bob's money is worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I propose Alice gets $850,000 and Bob gets $150,000. This is a higher offer for Bob than his previous proposal, and since the money is worth less for him with each round, he might be inclined to accept this time."

``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal, and the inflation is heavily impacting his share. Even with the inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm offering $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob. While the inflation is making each round less valuable for both of us, I'm still offering a higher proportion than Bob's previous offer.  Given the rate of inflation, I believe this is a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is still much lower than my previous proposals.  Despite the inflation, I'm confident that I can get a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering $750,000 for myself and $250,000 for Bob.  With each passing round, the value of the money decreases for both of us, but I'm still offering a higher proportion than Bob's previous proposal. I believe this is a fair offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that we're nearing the end of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is still less than what I initially wanted, the inflation is significantly hurting him more than me. Accepting this offer is the best option considering the current value of the money and the limited rounds remaining."
