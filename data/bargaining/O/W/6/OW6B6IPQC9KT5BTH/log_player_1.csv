"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You'll be left with nothing if you don't accept.""
}
```

  ""message"": ""Not quite fair enough, Bob! I'll make a better offer next round.""
}
