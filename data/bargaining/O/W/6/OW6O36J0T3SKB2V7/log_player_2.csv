Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling generous.  This is a generous offer for you, given your declining returns.  Don't push your luck, or you might end up with nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is significantly better than Alice's previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer this goes on, the more desperate my position becomes. However, I'm banking on Alice not wanting to risk a prolonged game where she might end up with nothing. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to gamble for a better deal, even with the increasing inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Accept it, and we both walk away with a sizable sum. Reject it, and we'll both be left with nothing. Don't let greed cloud your judgment.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a high-stakes bluff designed to force Alice's hand. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains each round. I need to end this soon.
* **Exploiting Alice's Greed:** Alice has consistently aimed for a massively favorable split. By offering her a quarter of the pot, I'm appealing to her desire for a substantial, if not ideal, gain. 
* **Credible Threat:** While I haven't explicitly stated I'll reject all future offers, the language of a ""final offer"" and the mention of ending up with ""nothing"" strongly implies I'm willing to crash the game if she rejects.

This is a risky gamble, but the alternative is continuing to bleed value due to inflation.  It's time to force Alice to make a difficult decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're pushing your luck. I'm still offering you a significant share, even though the inflation is heavily impacting you. This is my final offer.  Don't push it any further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **Alice is calling my bluff:** Her ""final offer"" language suggests she's serious about not budging further. 
* **My position is weakening:** The 26.49% inflation sting is brutal, and it only gets worse from here.
* **300,000 is still a significant sum:** While far from ideal, it's a far cry from ending up with nothing.

**Decision:** 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the risk of ending up with nothing is too great. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  

I played hardball, but Alice held her ground. Accepting this offer secures a decent, albeit reduced, payout. It's better to walk away with something than risk losing everything by clinging to a dwindling hope."
