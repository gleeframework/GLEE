"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I believe this is a good starting point for us, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that, let's try to meet in the middle""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'll meet you in the middle, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I think this is a reasonable offer, considering the decreasing value of the money. Meeting in the middle seems fair, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. Let's accept this offer and end the game."
