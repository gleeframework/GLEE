Let's see if we can get a better deal.  I'll try to make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to try to flip the script and see if Alice will accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my share is less than what I offered in Round 2,  it's still better than getting nothing after 12 rounds.  This is a good deal given the inflation factor."
