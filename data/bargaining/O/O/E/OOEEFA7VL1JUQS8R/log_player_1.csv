Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair division, with me taking 90% and you taking 10%.  It's a good start, and I'm sure we can reach a more equitable agreement in the future rounds.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily imbalanced. Let's be realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This recognizes that delaying benefits me more than you due to the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
