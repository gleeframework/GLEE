"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work towards a more even split in the future if you accept. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's important to remember that the money will be worth less in the future rounds. I'd rather see how Alice's offers change as we progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering a more balanced split.  We both lose value with each round, so let's work towards a quicker agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up more this time to move things along. Let's keep working towards a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The money is losing value quickly, and I'm not sure if Alice will be willing to give up much more. It's time to secure a decent amount."
