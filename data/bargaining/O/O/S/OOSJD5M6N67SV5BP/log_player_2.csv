"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I expect a fair return in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's far too early in the game to accept such an uneven split.  While Alice claims generosity, this is a very risky move for me. I can hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split.  We have a lot of rounds to go, and we can figure out a fair compromise as the game progresses.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be a little more equitable this time.  We both need to be satisfied with the outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to take its toll.  Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount of money, and I can't risk waiting longer and ending up with nothing."
