"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a simple offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This way, we both get 50% of the initial amount, and we can both finish the game in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll need to consider the value of the money in the future. If I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000 now, but it will be worth more in the future compared to if I wait and make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I'll choose to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 700,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher, but still leaving room for negotiation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than before, but still giving Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, I'll need to be careful. However, $200,000 is a relatively small amount, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll decide to accept this offer.
