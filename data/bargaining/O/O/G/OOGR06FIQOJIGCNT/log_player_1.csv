Since we've reached the 11th round and neither of us has accepted an offer, I propose that we go to a final arbitration.

Let's say we both agree to split the remaining $1,000,000 in half, as we did in the first round. That way, we can both walk away with a fair share.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

Let's call it a draw!"
