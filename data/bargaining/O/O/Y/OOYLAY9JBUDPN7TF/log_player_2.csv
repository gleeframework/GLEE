"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  This way we both get a good chunk of the money, and we can end this game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob!  While it's nice to end the game quickly, not at the cost of getting a tiny share. Alice is hoping Bob is impatient."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a fair 30% before inflation eats away at the value.  Take it while you can!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take 60% this time, but I think that's a fair amount considering we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's settle this before we both end up with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still trying to take advantage! While 40% is better than 10%, it's still not a good deal for Bob, especially with inflation eating into the pot. Bob needs to hold out for a better split."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
