# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. This offer still gives you a good share, and it prevents us from losing more to inflation. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's potential gains are worth to him due to the 10% inflation per round. This makes him more likely to propose more favorable deals to Alice as time progresses. However, this doesn't affect Alice's valuation.
* **Decent Offer:** 6000$ is still a significant portion of the 10000$. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a potentially better offer in Round 5 carries the risk of Bob proposing an even less favorable deal. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable outcome."
