I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. I'll take 90% and leave 10% for him.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a more even split, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round when I'm making the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and secure a larger portion of the money again, but this time I'll be a bit more reasonable. I'll offer Bob 30% while keeping 70% for myself.  The inflation is hurting me, and I need to get a good deal before it eats away too much more of my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting worse and worse for me!  The inflation is really starting to impact my share.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.  I need to start thinking about how to get a better deal with Bob, as the rounds are getting more and more risky."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a decent split before the inflation completely devours my potential earnings.  I'll offer Bob 40%, hoping that he'll see the value in accepting a deal before the money is worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is absolutely unacceptable. The inflation is really hitting me hard, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that. I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal.  I'm going to have to be a lot more strategic going forward if I want to get anything out of this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a very risky move, but with the inflation so high I need to try to salvage something. I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob recognizes the value of closing the deal before things get even worse for both of us.  If he rejects this, we are both in deep trouble."
