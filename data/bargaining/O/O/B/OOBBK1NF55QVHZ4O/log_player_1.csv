Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob in Round 2 is a 50-50 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for Round 2.
