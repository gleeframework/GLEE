Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share in the first round to avoid further rounds and potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, even with the inflation taken into account. It's better to keep playing and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm lowering my offer slightly to reflect the inflation, but still aiming for a significant share.  I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise a bit to avoid further rounds and more potential inflation."

Round 5

I'm lowering my offer again due to the increasing inflation, but I'm still aiming for a more even split. I think Bob will be more willing to compromise as the rounds progress and the potential of getting nothing increases."
