"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can have the first proposal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, let's make it 7-3 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:

Alice's gain: 300,000 x 0.95 = 285,000
Bob's gain: 700,000 x 0.9 = 630,000

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
