"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, and Bob would get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

In round 1, I was offered $60, but due to inflation, it's now worth 10% less, so it's equivalent to $54.

Bob's offer is $50, which is 20% less than the original $62.50 he would have gotten in round 1.

Considering the reduced value of money, I think I'd be better off accepting Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
