"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money 55/45 in favor of Bob. This aims to balance the previous proposal and account for the decreasing value of money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
