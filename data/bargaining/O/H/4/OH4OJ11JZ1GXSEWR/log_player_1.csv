"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400,000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 200,000 is now worth 160,000 (80% of 200,000). Bob's gain of 800,000 is still 800,000. I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll play it safe to avoid risking even less in future rounds.
