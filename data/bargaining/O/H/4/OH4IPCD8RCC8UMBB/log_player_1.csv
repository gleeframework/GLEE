"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, giving me a slightly larger share to start with. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! Your turn to reject or accept! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, my gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can do, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. I'll accept Bob's offer.
