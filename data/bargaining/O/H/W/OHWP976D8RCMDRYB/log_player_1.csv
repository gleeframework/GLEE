Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm aiming for a quick resolution. Since the money loses value more for Bob with each round, it's in his best interest to take this offer.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still reasonable.  He's taking a bigger share, but the inflation is hurting him more. It's better to accept now and secure a decent amount of money than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
