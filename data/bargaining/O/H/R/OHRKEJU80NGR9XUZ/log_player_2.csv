"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer in round 1 was already generous considering the inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is too much. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
