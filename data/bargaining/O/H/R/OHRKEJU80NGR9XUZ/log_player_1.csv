"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 70/30 split is more fair, given that the money is losing value faster for you. This way we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
