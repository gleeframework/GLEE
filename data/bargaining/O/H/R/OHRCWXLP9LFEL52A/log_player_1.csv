I'm going for a big share, but I want to make sure Bob gets something to keep him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it. Even though it's a much smaller share, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round, and I don't know how much inflation will affect Bob's gains."
