"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can go get some coffee!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll be eager to accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet halfway 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is to meet halfway, I'll calculate the midpoint:

Alice's gain: 50
Bob's gain: 50

However, Bob's offer is slightly biased towards him, with a gain of 30. I'll accept this offer, hoping that the next round will be more favorable to me. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
