"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I get the majority, but I'm willing to compromise if you're reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer might seem fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Rejecting allows me to make a counter-offer in the next round, and the inflation will mean I'll receive more money than accepting this offer now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm happy to split the money fairly, but I need to factor in the inflation.  This offer is a more even split, considering the money will be worth less in the next round.""}
