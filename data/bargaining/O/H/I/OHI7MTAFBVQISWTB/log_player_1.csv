"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that's hard to refuse. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $10,000, and we can call it a day. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it. My gain of $4000 is worth 20% less than my initial proposal, which was $5000. I'd rather wait for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800
}
```

This way, I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal, but I'm also being realistic about the decreasing value of money. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it. My gain of $3000 is worth 40% less than my initial proposal, which was $5000. I'd rather wait for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2400,
  ""bob_gain"": 7600
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm also being realistic about the decreasing value of money. What do you think, Bob?"
