"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which I believe is more than fair considering the inflation rate. I'll also include a friendly message to try to persuade him to accept the offer. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it a bit more even. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although he claims it's his final offer, I believe he's trying to intimidate me into accepting a suboptimal deal. With the inflation rate affecting his gains, I think I can get a better offer in the next round. Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Don't be too greedy!""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share than in my initial proposal, taking into account the inflation rate that's affecting his gains. I'll also include a message to caution him against being too greedy, hoping to make him realize that it's better to accept a reasonable offer rather than risking further losses due to inflation. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough Bob's offer seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation rate that's affecting his gains. Since his share is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'd actually be giving him a larger share of the original value. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. The pressure is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6100, ""bob_gain"": 3900, ""message"": ""You're running out of time!""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob an even smaller share, taking advantage of the fact that his gains are worth less due to inflation. I'll also include a message to remind him that time is running out, hoping to create a sense of urgency and make him more willing to accept my offer. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's meet in the middle. This is a compromise to get us both something. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject Bob's offer again. Although he claims it's a compromise, the inflation rate has reduced the value of his share significantly. Meeting in the middle doesn't account for the fact that his gains are worth 40.95% less than in the first round. I'll hold out for a better deal, as I believe Bob will become more desperate as the rounds continue. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""You're losing value fast!""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob an even smaller share, emphasizing the fact that his gains are rapidly losing value due to inflation. My message will remind him that the longer he waits, the less he'll get. I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency and make him more willing to accept my offer. Let's see how he responds!"
