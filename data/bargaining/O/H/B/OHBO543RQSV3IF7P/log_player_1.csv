"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll calculate my gain in the new currency.

$4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $3,200.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
