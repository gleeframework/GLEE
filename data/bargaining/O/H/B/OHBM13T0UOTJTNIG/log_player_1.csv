This offer gives me a larger share, but it's also fair, as I'm giving Bob a decent portion of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not great for me. Even though I get a larger share of the money, the inflation devalues my gains significantly. I'll reject this offer and see what happens next round."

I'm going to stick with a similar split to my first offer, but adjusted for the inflation.  This gives me a slightly larger share, but still offers Bob a decent amount.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, especially since he's facing much steeper inflation losses."
