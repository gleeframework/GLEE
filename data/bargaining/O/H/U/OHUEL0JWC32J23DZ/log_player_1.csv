Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 60,

```
I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and leaving 40% for Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 is worth 95% of the original 60, which is 58. My gain in real terms is $58.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
