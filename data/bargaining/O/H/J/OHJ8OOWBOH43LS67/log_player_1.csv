"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see how he reacts, and hoping he'll be willing to accept a smaller amount to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, but we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the value of the offer has changed.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I think it's a bit more reasonable than the 4:1 I offered earlier. I'll accept Bob's offer to see how the game unfolds.
