Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to account for inflation, but I still think I can do better. How about 58-42? The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to you! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that time is working against me due to inflation, but she's still offering deals significantly favoring herself.  I need to demonstrate I'm willing to risk it all to get a fairer split.  The longer I hold out, the more pressure is on her as well, since getting $0 at the end benefits no one."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this money.  Let's stop wasting time with these back-and-forth offers. 50-50 is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Inflation is eroding my potential gains, and delaying only hurts me more.  A strong stance is needed.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  By proposing 50-50, I'm highlighting the inherent fairness, putting the pressure back on Alice to justify taking more than half when it's her time pressure too.
* **Risk Calculation:**  There's risk Alice won't accept, but by this round, the potential gains for both of us are significantly diminished anyway. Holding out for much more might backfire completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You say 50-50 is fair, but I think you're forgetting the inflation. Every round, the money loses more value for you, not me. 59-41 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is using the inflation as a bargaining chip, but she's not acknowledging the time pressure it puts on BOTH of us. By sticking to her unfair offers, she risks us BOTH getting nothing. My rejection sends a clear message: I'm willing to play hardball to get a reasonable deal, even with the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm compromising.  This is eating into what I should get, but 48-52 reflects the urgency. Don't let greed make us both losers.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Strategically:** I'm acknowledging the inflation impact by slightly increasing Alice's share, showing a willingness to negotiate realistically. However, the increase is small, maintaining pressure on Alice.
* **Shifting Blame:**  The message frames rejecting my offer as ""greed"" on Alice's part, subtly turning the tables and making her appear unreasonable if she refuses a deal this late in the game. 
* **Final Push:**  There are only a few rounds left, and I need to secure a deal while I can still get something decent. This offer balances securing a win with not completely caving to Alice's demands."
