I'm going for a strong opening offer, hoping to secure most of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though my gains are worth less now due to inflation, I'm still hoping for a better split. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

This time, I'm proposing an even split. Since the inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it's in my best interest to secure a reasonable amount now. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than his previous proposal."
