"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'll still give you a chance to get something 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take a bigger share, and I'm not willing to accept an 80/20 split. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk too""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still gives me a decent share. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze out a bit more, but I'm getting worried about the time running out 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The split is still too far off from what I think is fair, and I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split. I'm starting to get worried about the time running out too, but I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal than settle for a lopsided split. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm""}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but still gives me a decent share. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."
