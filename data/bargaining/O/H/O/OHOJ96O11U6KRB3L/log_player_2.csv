It's time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very high. 
* **Fair Deal:** A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering Alice is the one heavily impacted by inflation.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in the remaining rounds, and continuing to gamble could lead to a worse outcome."
