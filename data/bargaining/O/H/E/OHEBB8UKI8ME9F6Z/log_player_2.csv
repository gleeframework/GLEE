Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Bob.  This is a bit closer to my initial offer, and factors in the inflation we both face. It's important to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is taking advantage of the faster inflation on my end. While the time pressure is on, accepting a deal where I consistently get a worse share is not a winning strategy.  I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about compromise, but we need to factor in the faster rate of inflation affecting my gains. This offer is fair and gives us both something.  Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but with the rapidly increasing inflation on both sides and the dwindling number of rounds, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for a better deal.  

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer guarantees a reasonable sum that, while diminished by inflation, is still better than walking away with nothing."
