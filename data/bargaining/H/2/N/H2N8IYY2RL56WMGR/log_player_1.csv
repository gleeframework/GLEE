"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\nSince it's the first round, there's no inflation yet, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly this time. 60/40 is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit less this time. 48% is a good compromise""}\n\nI've taken into account that the money I gain is now worth 20% less than the original amount, and 40% less than what Bob gains, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept."
