**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The money is losing value fast.  Waiting any longer significantly risks getting a much smaller amount, even if a ""better"" offer theoretically exists.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob seems set on getting at least 60. Given the time pressure, he's unlikely to budge much.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Rejecting this offer holds the risk of getting nothing at all if a deal isn't reached in the remaining rounds. 

It's a tough call, but accepting ensures Alice gets something rather than risking a complete loss."
