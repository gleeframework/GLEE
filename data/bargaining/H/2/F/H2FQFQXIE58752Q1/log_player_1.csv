"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here.""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a larger share right off the bat!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a huge chunk of the money!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's way too one-sided, Bob. I'm not willing to give up 70% of the money. Let's try again.""

```
{

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's completely unacceptable, Bob. I'm not willing to give up 99% of the money. You're being unreasonable.""

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a very small share, but I'm not going to give up the majority of the money. This is my final offer.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more extreme, with me taking the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will realize that he needs to accept this offer if he wants to get any money at all."

I'll reject his offer and try to make one final push for a more reasonable split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
