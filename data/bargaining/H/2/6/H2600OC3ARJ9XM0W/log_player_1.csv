"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself. I've included a message that says ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm trying to get a bit more than half. However, I'm still being somewhat generous to try to get Bob to accept the offer early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, given the inflation. We can both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm in a stronger position to negotiate. Bob's offer is not bad, but I believe I can get more than $4500 if I make a counteroffer. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, this is a good deal""}\n\nI'm making a new offer, taking into account the inflation that affects Bob's gain. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round, I'm offering him $3500, which is a bit less than the previous round. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money doesn't lose value for me, so I'm increasing my gain to $6500. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
