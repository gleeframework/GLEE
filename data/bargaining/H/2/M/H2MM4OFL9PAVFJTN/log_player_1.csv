"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  Take a smaller share now, and we'll both be better off in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll consider my options. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a smaller share now than risk waiting for a potentially lower amount in the future.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
