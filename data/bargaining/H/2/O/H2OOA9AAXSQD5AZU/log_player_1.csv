"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a reasonable starting offer, giving me a slightly larger share but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is meant to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly, minimizing the impact of inflation on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less to me now, I'm effectively being offered $427,500 (450,000 * 0.95). I think I can get a better share than that. Plus, accepting this offer would mean Bob gets the larger share, which I'm not willing to agree to yet. By rejecting, I'll get to make the next proposal and try to sway the deal back in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the 5% decrease in value for my share due to inflation. To counteract this and still aim for a favorable division, I've adjusted my proposal. By offering $575,000 for myself and $425,000 for Bob, I'm effectively aiming for a middle ground that slightly favors me, considering the inflation. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is a psychological appeal to Bob, suggesting that this offer is a compromise and that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result for him. This approach aims to end the game sooner rather than later, minimizing further loss of value for my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, the effective value of my share from Bob's offer is now $407,095 (475,000 * 0.8574, since 1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574). Given that this is Bob's ""final offer"" and the threat of further inflation will only decrease my potential gain, I've decided to accept this offer. Continuing to negotiate risks further devaluation of the money for me without a guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting now secures a still significant amount, despite not being the most favorable division I had hoped for."
