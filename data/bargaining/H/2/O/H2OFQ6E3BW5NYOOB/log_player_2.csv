"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer seems fair on the surface, Alice is losing money at a much faster rate than I am. I can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal, Alice. However, the value of the money decreases faster for you than for me. This offer accounts for that difference.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is still generous, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is right about time running out, but her offer is getting worse for me while it remains relatively good for her given the inflation rate. I need to push for a better split before the value diminishes too much, but I need to be careful not to push her away completely."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  This offer gives us both something reasonable considering the time pressure and inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We both lose if this goes on. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  The longer we wait, the less we both get, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
