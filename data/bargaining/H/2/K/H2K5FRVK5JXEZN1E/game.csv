60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose I take $60 and you take $40. It's important to reach a deal quickly because the value decreases over time. What do you think?",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I think your offer was a bit biased. How about we split it 55-45? It's still a good deal for you, and we should try to reach an agreement soon.",Bob,2,

42.0,58.0,"Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer, but I still think I can get a bit more. Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'll take 58 and you can have 42. Let's make a deal!",Bob,4,
