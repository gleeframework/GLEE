"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This way, I'll get 70% of the original $100, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $60 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $54. Bob's share of $40 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $32.

I'll accept this offer.
