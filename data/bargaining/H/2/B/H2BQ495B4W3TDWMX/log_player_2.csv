Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers, now it's even worse for you! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing significantly for me (Bob), accepting this offer would mean I lose out on a significant chunk of the initial amount.  There's a psychological element to this game, and Alice might be trying to pressure me into taking a bad deal. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to risk further inflation to get a more reasonable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""It seems we're at an impasse. I'm willing to accept your original offer to avoid further losses.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Alice has consistently offered a larger share to herself, and further rounds will only erode my potential earnings. It's time to cut my losses and accept a less-than-ideal but still substantial sum."
