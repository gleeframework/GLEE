"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% and we'll see how this goes. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very unfair offer!  I'll make a better counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That's not fair at all, Alice.  Let's be reasonable - I'll take 60%, you take 40%.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60% is still too much. Let's try 80/20 this time. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is still a terrible deal! While it's better than her first offer, I'm losing a significant amount of value to inflation if this drags on. I need to make a stronger counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is the definition of fair - 50/50. Take it or leave it.""}
