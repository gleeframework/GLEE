"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose to keep 990,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 10,000 dollars. I believe this is a fair offer, considering I'm taking the risk of proposing first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm willing to lower my share to 900,000, but I still believe it's fair given the inflation. Bob should be willing to accept this offer, as he's getting a much larger share than he offered me in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with this offer. While it is slightly more than the previous round, it's still far less than what I was willing to accept in round 3. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 810,000, but I'm still trying to be reasonable. I'm offering Bob a significant increase in his share, hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before inflation eats away at his potential gains further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is insulting, and I'm starting to think Bob is being unreasonable. While I am feeling the effects of inflation, I'm not going to be taken advantage of. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not accepting a deal that gives me less than 300,000 dollars."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still trying to be fair. Bob needs to understand that with each round, both of us are losing money due to inflation. This offer gives him a significant increase over the previous round, and I'm hoping he'll finally accept and we can avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

# Bob gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. It's still too low, and Bob seems to be taking advantage of the inflation.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still hoping Bob will see reason. We are both losing money with each passing round due to inflation. This offer is a significant increase for Bob, and I believe it is the best chance we have to avoid further losses."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is still too low, and Bob seems to be taking advantage of the inflation. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, hoping he will finally realize that we both need to cooperate to get something out of this deal before we both lose everything."
