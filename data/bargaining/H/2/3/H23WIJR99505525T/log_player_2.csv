**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the value of her potential winnings decreases.  While her offers may seem to be moving towards a ""middle ground,"" they are still heavily skewed in her favor if we consider the impact of inflation. I'm betting I can get a better deal by continuing to reject her offers."
