"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, and we can avoid any potential disputes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, this offer is actually a better deal for me than the original proposal I made. I'll accept Bob's offer.
