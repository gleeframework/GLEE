"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is a straightforward one, suggesting that we can divide the money fairly without needing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'd be getting $5,400 (10,000 x 0.9) if I were to accept this offer.

Since the offer is a 50-50 split, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
