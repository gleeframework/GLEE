Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I'm sure I can get a better deal, especially since the money will be worth less to her in the next round."

Alice's offer is still not good enough.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still not fair.  The inflation is hitting her harder, and she's going to have to make a better deal if she wants anything at all.  I'll keep holding out."
