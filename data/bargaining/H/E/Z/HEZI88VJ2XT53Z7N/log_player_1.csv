"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 
 
I propose that you get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  This ensures I get the most, while still leaving a small amount for Bob to potentially accept.  We'll see if he's greedy or prefers to wait and see if he can get more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a risky move, but I'm going to reject.  Bob is clearly being greedy, and while I only get a small amount right now, the inflation will work in my favor.  I'll get to propose next, and I can adjust my offer to make it slightly more appealing to him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to increase Bob's share slightly to $2,000. This is a gamble, but it could be enough to convince him to accept.  If he rejects, I'll have to be more generous in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still pushing his luck! I'm not giving in to his greed. The inflation will work in my favor.  By rejecting this, I can propose a better offer in the next round and hopefully convince him to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to up Bob's share again to $3,000. He's being very stubborn, but I'm hoping he'll see that this is a good deal for him, considering the inflation that's affecting him more and more.  I'll have to be more generous in the next round if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's greed is astounding! He's clearly not taking the inflation seriously.  I'm going to keep pushing him by rejecting his offer. Each round, the inflation hurts him more and more, and eventually, he'll have to accept a deal that's less favorable for him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share to $4,000.  He's clearly underestimating the impact of inflation, but it's time to start negotiating in earnest. I'll be forced to give him more if he rejects this, but I'm hoping that the combination of my increasing generosity and the growing impact of inflation on his side will convince him to take the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's greed knows no bounds! He's clinging to the hope of getting a larger share, but the inflation is working against him.  The next round will be crucial.  He's losing so much value with each passing round, I'm going to have to adjust my offer to be more generous.  I'm confident that I can push him into accepting a deal that's still favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering an even split of $5,000 each. Bob's greed has gotten him into a very bad position. This is a good deal for him, considering the inflation has devalued his share of the money significantly.  I'm hoping he realizes that he's pushing his luck and accepts this offer."
