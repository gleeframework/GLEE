Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation we're dealing with. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to propose the same split as I did in the first round, but with the adjusted values due to inflation.

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better split.

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to adjust the split to reflect the increased inflation. However, I'm not convinced that a 45-55 split is fair, considering the initial offer I made was a 60-40 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a compromise, but I'm not convinced that a 35-65 split is sufficient, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation. I'd like to try to get a better deal for myself.

# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting desperate, and I can sense that he's willing to give in. However, I'm not sure if a 25-75 split is a good deal for me, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

# Alice gain: 850000 
# Bob gain: 150000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting extremely desperate, and I'm starting to think that accepting this offer might be the best option. Considering the massive loss in value due to inflation, a 15-85 split is actually a relatively fair deal for me.
