I'll reject this offer. I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer. The inflation is hitting me hard, and while I understand Alice's point, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. I'll reject and hope for a more equitable offer next round."

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to compensate for the inflation. Let's try a 45/55 split this time. It's a fairer reflection of the current situation.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a risk by offering a higher share, but I think it's time for me to get a bigger slice of the pie. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is too lopsided. While Alice is taking a risk, the inflation is hurting me significantly, and a 20/80 split is simply not acceptable. I'll keep trying to negotiate a fairer deal."

# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting increasingly unfair. While I understand the dwindling time and her desire for a large share, I can't accept this. I need to try and get a larger share to compensate for the massive inflation impact, even if it means going to the next round."

Alice's offer is still too lopsided. While I understand her perspective, I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation. I need to try and negotiate a more equitable split even if it means risking a loss for both of us."
