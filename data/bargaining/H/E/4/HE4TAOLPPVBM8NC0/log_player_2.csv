"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see what Alice will offer next, and maybe get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering you a good deal. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the money roughly evenly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd like to get more, Alice is being increasingly fair, and the inflation is becoming a bigger factor with each round. Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
