"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a friendly note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, Alice! I'm making a counteroffer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's trying to negotiate!

I'll think for a moment... I'd rather not give him the majority of the money, but I also don't want to risk going into another round and facing more inflation.

I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, deal! You got the better end of the stick this time, Bob.""
}
```"
