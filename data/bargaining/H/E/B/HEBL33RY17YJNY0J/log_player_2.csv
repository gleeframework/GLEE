# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting progressively more desperate, and her offers are slowly becoming more reasonable. However, I believe I still have the upper hand. The inflation is hurting her more than me, and with each passing round, the value of her offers diminishes while mine remain constant.  I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer, but we still need to find a better balance. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, and Alice is indicating this is her final offer. While not ideal, it's much better than my outcome if we fail to agree and get nothing. It's a tough call, but taking the sure bet at this stage seems like the most rational choice."
