Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle

This is a tough one, and depends on your risk appetite. Here's why I considered accepting:

* **Decreasing Returns:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of you. Holding out for much more might not be worth it in the long run.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems to be aiming for a slightly larger share, but this offer is reasonably close to a 50/50 split after accounting for some inflation. 
* **Risk of Further Rejection:** If I reject, there's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Alice in the next round, and the money will be worth even less.

**It's a close call**,  but accepting ensures a reasonable amount now, even if it's not the absolute maximum I could try to squeeze out."
