Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is ticking and the money is losing value fast, especially for you. I'm increasing my share to encourage a deal.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a game of diminishing returns. We both lose if we drag this out. I'm standing firm on a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims to be standing firm on a ""fair"" split, the declining value of the money heavily favors me, Alice.  He's losing value much faster than I am. I need to push him towards a deal that reflects this disparity, even if it means taking a slight hit from my initial offer."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm holding my ground. This is my final offer. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly entrenched, and while this offer isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue.  

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if I could secure a slightly better deal in later rounds, the inflation means the actual gain would be minimal. 
* **Bob's Stance:**  His language (""final offer"", ""holding my ground"") suggests he's unlikely to budge further. 

It's better to accept a less-than-perfect deal now than risk losing everything by being too greedy."
