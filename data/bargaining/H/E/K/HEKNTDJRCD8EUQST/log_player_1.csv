Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive opening offer.  I'm hoping Bob will be eager to take what he can get, since there's a chance the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob is taking a bigger chunk, I'm still getting a decent amount, and I don't want to risk further inflation."
