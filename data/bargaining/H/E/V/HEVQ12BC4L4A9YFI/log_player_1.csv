"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer is essentially all the money for Alice, with just $1 going to Bob.  I figure Bob will probably reject this, but it establishes my position as wanting the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is the mirror image of mine, and I am not going to accept being given a mere $1!  I'll counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a much more substantial share, 100,000 dollars.  This is a significant amount, and I believe it might be enough to entice him to accept the offer.  However, I still want a significant portion of the money, as the game is quickly losing value due to inflation.  Let's see if Bob will finally agree to a deal."
