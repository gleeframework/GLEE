"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I want to get a large share of the money, but I'm also willing to be somewhat generous to Bob in the hope that he'll accept the offer. This will allow us to end the game quickly and both get some money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation affecting his gains. I'm confident I can get a better deal if we continue playing. I'll need to adjust my strategy, but I'm not giving up this easily."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for Bob's inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money.  I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough, even considering the inflation. I'm willing to accept a lower share, but not this low.  I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to account for Bob's inflation, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and I hope Bob will accept it before his losses from inflation become even greater."
