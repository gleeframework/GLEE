I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm not going to accept this offer. It's a huge drop from my initial proposal, and I'm not going to settle for that little. Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to try and find a middle ground here. Bob's offer was too low, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid further rounds and the risk of inflation eating away at my gains."
