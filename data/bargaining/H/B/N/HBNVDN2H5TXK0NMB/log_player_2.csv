Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a bit more.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll try to adjust for the inflation and make a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 19% less, and I had initially rejected a 50/50 split, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the reduced value.

However, considering Alice's offer, I'll decide to accept this one, as it's still a decent split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value.
