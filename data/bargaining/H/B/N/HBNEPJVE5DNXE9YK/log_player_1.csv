I'm going to propose a slightly unfair split in my favor. Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, it's best to take a larger share early on. I'll see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer more money, I'm aware of the inflation affecting our gains. The 70/30 split is actually more equitable than my original proposal. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing in later rounds due to inflation."
