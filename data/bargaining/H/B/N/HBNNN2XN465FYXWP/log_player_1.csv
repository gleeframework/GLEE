"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 36 (since it's 10% less than 40). I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain will be worth 32 (since 40 is 10% less than 44). Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you can have 30, it's the best I can do! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 30 is now worth around 21.9 (since 30 is 27.1% less than 41.4). Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain. With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain will be worth 21.9 (since 30 is 27.1% less than 41.4). Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I need to get a fair share!""
}
```"
