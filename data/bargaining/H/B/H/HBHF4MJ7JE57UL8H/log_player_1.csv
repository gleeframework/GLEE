Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things more fairly, Alice. Time is ticking and the value decreases with each round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is fair and avoids significant losses for both of us due to inflation. Let's be sensible.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though the time pressure is mounting, I'm not willing to accept less than half. Bob's perception of value is decreasing faster than mine, so I need to remain firm and hope he proposes a better offer in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is ridiculous. We're approaching a point where the inflation makes this pointless for me. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's time to accept.  While not ideal, getting an even split at this point is better than risking getting nothing if we both continue to be stubborn. Bob is right, the inflation is severely impacting the value of his potential gains.  It's unlikely he'll offer anything better than this."
