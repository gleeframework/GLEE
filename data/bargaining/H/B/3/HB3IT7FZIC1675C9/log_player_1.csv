I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round, avoiding any inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled about the offer, it's better than getting 5% less than what I'd get in the next round.  I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's offer in the future, so it's safer to accept now."
