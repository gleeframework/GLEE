"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me, I'll reject this offer because I can try to get a better deal in the next round. For Bob, the money will be worth even less, so I have some leverage.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll make a slightly more generous offer, considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gains. I'll offer Bob $4500 and take $5500 for myself, hoping he'll accept before the money loses more value.
