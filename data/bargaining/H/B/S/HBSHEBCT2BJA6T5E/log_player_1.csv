"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more for my part in this negotiation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in Round 2, my gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,600.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
