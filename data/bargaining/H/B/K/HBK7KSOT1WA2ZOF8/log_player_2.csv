``` 
Let's see if Alice will offer me more in the next round!  I'm not settling for such a small share, especially knowing I have 11 more rounds to try and get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm thinking we should aim for a more even split. This offer is fair and leaves room for both of us to get a decent share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is shrinking. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not convinced. While Alice is correct that time is running out, I'm not willing to settle for such a disproportionate split, especially since my share is worth even less now due to inflation.  I'll see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round.  Let's compromise and split it more evenly. This offer is a step closer to a fair split, and hopefully we can reach a resolution before the money dwindles away completely.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  This is a fair offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too far off from what I think is fair.  I'm going to hold out for a more even split, even though the money is worth significantly less now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this quickly.  The money is dwindling away, and neither of us is going to get a good deal if we keep rejecting each other's offers.  Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. This offer is fair to both of us, and will save us both a lot of money.""}
