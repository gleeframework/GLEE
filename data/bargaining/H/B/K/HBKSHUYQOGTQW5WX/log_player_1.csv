"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a high-stakes opening offer. While it's unlikely Bob will accept, I'm hoping to get a better counter offer in the next round.  This also sets the stage for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a ridiculous offer.  While I realize Bob is trying to get the lion's share,  I'm not going to accept a measly $1,000. I need to see a much more fair split. I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer considering the inflation factor. I believe Bob will be more inclined to accept a more equitable distribution now."
