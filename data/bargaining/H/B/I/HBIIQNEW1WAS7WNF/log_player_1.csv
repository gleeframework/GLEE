"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI'll take 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob will get the remaining 40%, which is $400,000. I've also included a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but consider the inflation. This offer ensures you get more in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a generous offer. Don't wait for further depreciation!""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob 42% of the money, while I'll take 58%. Given the inflation, this is a relatively generous offer, and I've included a message to Bob suggesting that accepting this offer would be wise, as the value of the money will continue to decrease in subsequent rounds. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic: the longer this goes on, the more we both lose. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise at this point. Continuing the game would likely result in further losses for both of us, so it's best to settle on this offer. Decision: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
