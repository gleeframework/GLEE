"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 60% 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but consider the inflation. This offer ensures you get more in the long run.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Inflation:** The key to this game is recognizing the impact of inflation. While Alice's initial offer seemed appealing, waiting even a single round significantly reduces the value of the money.
* **Strategic Counter Offer:** My offer might seem like I'm taking a smaller piece of the pie initially. However, by offering Alice slightly more than her previous offer (after her 10% inflation hit), I'm making it more enticing for her to accept *now*.
* **Message Emphasis:**  The message aims to make Alice realize that delaying for a potentially ""better"" offer in later rounds will likely result in a smaller actual gain due to the rapid inflation working against her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer. Don't wait for further depreciation! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation factor to pressure me into taking a worse deal. While it's true the money is losing value, her offer is still proportionally worse than her initial offer.  I need to hold my ground for a slightly better split, knowing that time is working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic: the longer this goes on, the more we both lose. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Catching Up:** At this stage, the inflation is starting to significantly impact even my potential gains. While I could push for a slightly larger share, the risk of Alice rejecting and the money devaluing further makes it less worthwhile.
* **50/50 as a Psychological Anchor:**  By this round, Alice has likely realized that continuously demanding a 60/40 split isn't realistic.  Offering a 50/50 split now seems ""fair"" in comparison and might be enough to entice her to accept.
* **Urgency in the Message:**  The message emphasizes that time is the enemy for *both* of us. By highlighting the mutual loss from continued delays, I'm hoping to nudge Alice towards a swift resolution."
