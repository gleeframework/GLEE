"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, which I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effects of inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my effective gain from Bob's offer is:

500,000 / 0.95 = 526315.79

So, I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
