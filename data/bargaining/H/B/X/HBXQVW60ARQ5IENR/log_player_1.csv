"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair start, considering the inflation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
