"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000$ for me, 100,000$ for Bob. This is a fair offer that gives Bob a chance to get some money, but most of the money goes to me as I am the one taking the risk of losing value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
