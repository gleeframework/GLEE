"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, but I'm willing to give you more than that. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and now he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm still not willing to give up too much to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm starting to get desperate. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can still get a better deal in future rounds.
