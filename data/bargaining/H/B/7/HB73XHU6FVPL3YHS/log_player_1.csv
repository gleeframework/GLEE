"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount. Bob's offer is:

# Alice gain: 450000 / 0.9 = 500000 (original amount)
# Bob gain: 550000 / 0.95 = 577894.74 (original amount)

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a slightly larger share, but I'll accept the offer since it's still a relatively fair split. I'll take the offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
