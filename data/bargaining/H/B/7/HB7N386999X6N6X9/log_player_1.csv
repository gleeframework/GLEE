"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems reasonable given that I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair start, but I think we can both do a bit better. How about we split it 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject his offer, since it's actually worse for me than my original proposal. The value of the money is decreasing with each round, so I'll try to make a better offer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""You were supposed to offer me a better deal, Bob! I'm trying to be generous here.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the inflation and trying to stay ahead of the game."
