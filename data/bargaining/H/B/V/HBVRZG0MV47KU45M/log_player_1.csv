"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm holding out for more! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll have to accept a smaller share, but I don't want to give up too much.

I'll accept this offer for now.
