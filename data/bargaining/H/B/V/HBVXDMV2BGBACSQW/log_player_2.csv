Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling confident about my chances, but I'm still open to a deal that's fair for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution before the clock runs out. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is better than the initial one, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor.  The impact of inflation is becoming more significant with each round.  It's time to show Alice we're serious about getting a fairer deal, even if it means risking a lower amount further down the line."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a 50/50 split, perfectly fair for both of us. Take it before inflation eats away at the value!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, and by now, Alice should realize that dragging this out only hurts Bob due to inflation. This offer creates a sense of urgency and demonstrates that Bob is unwilling to settle for significantly less, even with the increasing impact of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm still looking for a deal that gives me a significant share. Time is running out, let's make this work. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is essentially repeating her offer from Round 3, completely disregarding the impact of inflation on Bob.  While the pressure is mounting, accepting now would be a significant loss. It's clear Bob needs to demonstrate he's serious about a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  It's a 60/40 split in your favor, acknowledging your desire for a larger share.  However, we're running out of time, and inflation is eating into the deal. Let's be realistic and end this now.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a final push with a compromise that leans in Alice's favor but still secures a reasonable amount for Bob.  By emphasizing that this is his final offer and highlighting the time pressure and inflation impact, Bob adds weight to his proposal.  This strategy aims to persuade Alice to accept a realistic deal before the opportunity for any agreement disappears entirely."
