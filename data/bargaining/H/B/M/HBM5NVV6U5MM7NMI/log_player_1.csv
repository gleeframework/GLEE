"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  This is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small share to consider while still leaving the majority for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 700,000 for myself and 300,000 for Bob. This is a compromise that accounts for the inflation while still securing a large share for me."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, the offer is still far less favorable to me than my previous proposal.  I'm willing to negotiate further but need to secure a larger share."

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 500,000 for me and 500,000 for Bob.  With inflation significantly impacting both of us, I believe this is the most equitable split given the circumstances. This offers a fair compromise and ensures we both receive a decent amount."
