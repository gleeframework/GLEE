"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still gain $6,000 in value, which is more than Bob's offer of $4,500. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.
