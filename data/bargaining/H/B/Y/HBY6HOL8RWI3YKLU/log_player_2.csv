Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is affecting us both, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. Let's compromise with a 55/45 split. This way, we can both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
