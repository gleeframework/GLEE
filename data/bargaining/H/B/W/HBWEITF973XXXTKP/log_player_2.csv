"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 4000 for me and 6000 for her, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer for myself. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is equal, it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair starting point. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
