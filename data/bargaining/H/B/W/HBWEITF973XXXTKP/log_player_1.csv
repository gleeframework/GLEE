"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's even less favorable than mine from the previous round. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","It's my turn again!

Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split. It's a fair offer, don't you think?"
