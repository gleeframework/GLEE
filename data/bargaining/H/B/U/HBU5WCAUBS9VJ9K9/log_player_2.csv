Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this. This offer gives me some cushion against inflation, but it's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and her offers are getting worse for her. While this offer is slightly better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. We can likely push for a much better deal as the game progresses and the inflation eats further into her potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against you. I propose a fair 50/50 split to end this now."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Offering a 50/50 split might seem generous considering the game's dynamics, but it establishes a strong position. Alice is likely feeling the heat of the shrinking pot, and this offer gives her a clean, even split before the inflation makes her situation even worse."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. It gives me a buffer against the inflation, but you're still getting a decent chunk. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the game. Alice is clearly getting desperate, calling this her final offer. However, while her gain is eroding quickly, it's still the best offer she's made so far. She's bluffing. We need to hold strong and make it clear that we won't accept anything less than a favorable deal. The pressure is mounting on her, not us."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. You're running out of time and the inflation is eating your potential gains. I'm offering a 60/40 split. Take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time to apply maximum pressure.  We're past the halfway point, and Alice is feeling the squeeze. By demanding 60%, we're pushing our advantage, but it's still within a reasonable realm for her to accept, especially given the dire alternative. This firm stance emphasizes the ticking clock and might be enough to get her to concede."
