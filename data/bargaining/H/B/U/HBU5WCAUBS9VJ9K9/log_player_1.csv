# Alice gain: 400000

**Reasoning:**

While far from ideal, at this point, the inflation has severely eroded Alice's potential gains. Rejecting this offer and hoping for a better deal in the remaining rounds is too risky. 

* **Time Pressure:** Only 6 rounds remain. Continuing means risking getting zero if no agreement is reached.
* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes on, the less valuable Alice's potential share becomes. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's ""take it or leave it"" message suggests he's unlikely to budge much in subsequent offers.

It's better to secure a smaller portion now than gamble on getting a larger, but increasingly less valuable, amount later and risk ending up with nothing."
