"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start!""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  No need for complications. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it... 

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You wanted fair, but I'm willing to compromise. 60-40 is a good middle ground.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more in my favor, but I'm still trying to be reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
