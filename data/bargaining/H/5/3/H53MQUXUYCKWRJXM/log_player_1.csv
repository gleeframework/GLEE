"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still looking to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the relative value of the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I was hoping for a better deal, and I think I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer, taking into account the inflation that's affecting the value of Bob's gain.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the absolute values.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer because I think 75 is a reasonable amount, and it's better than what I could get in the next round, considering the effects of inflation."
