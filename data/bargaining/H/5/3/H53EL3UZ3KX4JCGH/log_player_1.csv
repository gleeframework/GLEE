"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I get a bit more""}\n\nMy offer is 55 for me and 45 for Bob. I've included a message to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Please let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be more equal this time, how about we split it 55/45? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but 20% less for Bob, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think I deserve a bit more this time""}\n\nMy new offer is 60 for me and 40 for Bob. I've taken into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less for Bob in this round, and 40% less than in the first round, so I believe my offer is reasonable. I've included a message to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Please let me know Bob's response."
