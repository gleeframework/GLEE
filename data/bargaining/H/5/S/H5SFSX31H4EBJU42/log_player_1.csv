"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to the next step."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try an even split this time. It's fair and we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, as I was hoping to get a bit more considering I'm the one making the initial proposal. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial proposal. This 55-45 split is a fair compromise""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal."
