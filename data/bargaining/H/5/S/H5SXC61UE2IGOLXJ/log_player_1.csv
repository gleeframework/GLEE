"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40, which is worth 80% of the original $50 I would have gotten in Round 1.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about accepting Bob's offer. I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, as I'm not getting any younger (i.e., the rounds are passing, and the money is getting worth less). I'm willing to take a smaller share to try to get the game over with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is even less appealing than it seems. If I accept, I'll get $20, which is worth only about 40% of the original $50 I would have gotten in Round 1.

I'm not thrilled about accepting this offer, but I'm also getting desperate. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 15, ""bob_gain"": 85}

I'm getting really desperate, and I'm willing to take an even smaller share to try to get the game over with. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not optimistic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, the inflation is really getting out of control!

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is even more unappealing than it seems. If I accept, I'll get $10, which is worth only about 20% of the original $50 I would have gotten in Round 1.

I'm really struggling to accept this offer, but I'm running out of options. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 5, ""bob_gain"": 95}

I'm getting really desperate, and I'm willing to take an extremely small share to try to get the game over with. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not holding my breath."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm really struggling to accept this offer. If I accept, I'll get $1, which is worth only about 2% of the original $50 I would have gotten in Round 1. It's a tiny amount of money, and I'm not sure it's worth accepting.

But at the same time, I'm running out of options and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll think carefully before making a decision.
