"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my first offer. I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money, as I am the first to make an offer and am not subject to inflation yet. I'm giving Bob a smaller portion to incentivize him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, Bob's offer is still better than what I would get if I reject and proceed to the next round. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and I'm not guaranteed a better offer."
