"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can discuss further if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 40%."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $270,000. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a slightly larger share, considering the decreased value of the money.""
