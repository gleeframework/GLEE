I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see if Bob is willing to accept a quick deal.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. The inflation is making my gains significantly smaller, and Bob's offer is at least a decent split. I'll take it."
