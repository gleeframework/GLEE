I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not sure how inflation is affecting Alice, so I might be able to get a larger share."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Alice $40 and keep $60 for myself.  I'm hoping this is enough to get her to accept, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
