"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Inflation is hitting us both, so a 50/50 split seems fair. We both get a decent share, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily disadvantages me.  I need to push for a slightly better share while there's still time, or the deal will quickly become unfavorable even with an even split."
