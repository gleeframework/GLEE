60.0,40.0,"Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a good deal for both of us, and we avoid losses from inflation by settling now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's split the money 55/45. It's a more fair deal, considering I get a bigger share. Inflation will decrease the value if we don't settle now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is the most fair we'll get. 55/45 is the best you'll get, take it or leave it.",Alice,3,

42.5,57.5,"You said 55/45 was the best I'd get, but I think we can do better. Considering inflation is eating away at our money, let's settle on 57.5/42.5 and be done with it.",Bob,4,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both get a decent amount. Let's end this now.",Alice,5,
