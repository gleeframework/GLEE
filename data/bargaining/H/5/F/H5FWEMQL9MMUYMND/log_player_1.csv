"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer, giving you $900,000 and Bob $100,000. I'm aiming for a large portion of the money as I benefit more from quick agreement. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant drop from my previous offer, and although I'm losing value with each round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob.  I still need to secure a majority, but I'm willing to be a bit more flexible to reach an agreement before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers, but I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a better deal. I reject his offer and prepare to make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm dropping my offer again, but still aiming for a larger share.  With the inflation rate, I need to be more assertive to secure a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the value of my share is much lower than in the beginning, I'm now facing a significant risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting.  Bob's offer is closer to an even split, and it's the best I can expect at this point. I accept."
