"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the $100 and leaving 30% for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, so I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair, but I want a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since the money is worth less than before. I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and I'm trying to make a better offer, I'll propose:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more this time.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm still not satisfied 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still not willing to accept a 55-45 split, even though it's a bit better than the previous offers. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting even scarcer due to inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still trying to be fair.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 60-40 split, as it's the best offer I've seen so far, and the money's value is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I think it's time to cut my losses and accept a decent deal."
