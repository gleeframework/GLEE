I'm going to be greedy in the first round and try to take almost everything. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  Even though I'm getting less than I wanted, it's still a substantial amount of money. It's not worth risking that I'll get nothing at all if we keep going."
