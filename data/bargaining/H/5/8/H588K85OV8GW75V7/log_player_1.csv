Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a hit from inflation, but I'm still willing to compromise. This is the best I can offer, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's end this game with a mutually acceptable deal. 
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to our preferred outcome. While we'd prefer to have a larger share, the longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for Bob, increasing the pressure on him to make a deal.  

However, there's a risk he might hold out hoping we'll panic and accept a worse offer in later rounds. Accepting now locks in a reasonable gain and avoids the risk of getting a much lower offer later."
