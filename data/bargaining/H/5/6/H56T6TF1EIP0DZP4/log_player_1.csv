"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate further if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 200,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation reducing my potential earnings, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm trying to make up for the inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 40% for me is a fair share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can accept this compromise. 40% is a decent share, and I'd rather take it than risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
