"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 400,000 x 0.9 = 360,000
Bob gain: 600,000 x 0.9 = 540,000

I'll accept this offer.
