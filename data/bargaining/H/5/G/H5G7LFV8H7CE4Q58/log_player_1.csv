"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm curious to see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a bigger share, huh?

Considering the offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob 70% of the remaining money, especially since the value of the money has already decreased due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more now. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42% share for myself, which is a slight increase from my initial offer, but still a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too generous, Alice. I'm willing to take a bit less, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being a tough negotiator!

Considering the offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob 55% of the remaining money, especially since the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'd like to make another counteroffer, trying to get a better share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's make a deal?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48% share for myself, which is a slight increase from my previous offers, and a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of the money."
