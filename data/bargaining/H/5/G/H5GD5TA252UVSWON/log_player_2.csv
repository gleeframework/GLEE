**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offer is slightly better, it's likely she will continue to decrease her demand as the rounds progress and her potential gains shrink.  Bob can afford to hold out a little longer and aim for a more favorable split."
