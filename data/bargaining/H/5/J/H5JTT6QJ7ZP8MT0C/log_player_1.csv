"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a good starting point, and with inflation, it will be more beneficial for me to get a larger share now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this is a significantly worse deal than the first round, I'm not ready to give up 85 dollars just yet. Inflation is hurting Bob more, so I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but still maintain a decent share. With inflation, Bob's money is losing value quicker, so I'm hoping this is a good balance for us both."
