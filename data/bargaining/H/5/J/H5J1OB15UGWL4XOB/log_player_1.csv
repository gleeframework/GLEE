"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100, leaving 20% for Bob. This is a relatively generous starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of 50 in this round is actually equivalent to 40 in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's gain of 50 is equivalent to 50 in the first round, but I'll assume it is.

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is fair, considering the inflation. I'll reject the offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is fair, considering the inflation. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 40% of the original value, so I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm adjusting for inflation. Will you accept this new offer?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the current value of the money, leaving 40% for Bob."
