Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven split. I'm hoping Bob will be greedy enough to accept this offer in the first round.  If not, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much better than the one I made in the first round, even with the 20% inflation on his side. It's a significant amount of money, and I don't want to risk losing everything in future rounds.  I'm accepting."
