"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. It's a reasonable starting point, considering the inflation rates favor me less than Bob. The message ""Let's split fairly!"" aims to set a tone of cooperation while also being clear about my expectations for a slightly larger share due to the less severe impact of inflation on my side. This approach tests Bob's willingness to compromise early on, potentially leading to a quick resolution that benefits both parties before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, his proposed split of 45-55 in his favor doesn't align with the initial fair split I suggested, considering the inflation rates. Accepting this would mean I'm not only getting less due to inflation but also agreeing to a less favorable split. Given the game's early stage and the fact that inflation impacts Bob more significantly, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more equitable division. By rejecting, I aim to pressure Bob into reconsidering or to make a counteroffer in the next round that could be more favorable or closer to my initial proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway from my first offer.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more conservative offer compared to my first one, aiming to appear more conciliatory while still acknowledging the impact of inflation on both of us. By suggesting we meet halfway from my initial offer, I'm attempting to steer the negotiation towards a compromise that slightly favors me, due to the less severe impact of inflation on my side. This approach also tests Bob's willingness to negotiate in good faith, considering the decreasing value of the money for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation. Let's settle and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer in round 4 because, despite his message framing it as reasonable considering inflation, the split of 48-52 in his favor still doesn't adequately reflect the differential impact of inflation on us. Given that the money I gain is now worth 14.26% less and Bob's is worth 27.1% less than initially, I believe his offer doesn't sufficiently account for these losses. By rejecting, I'm pushing for a negotiation that factors in the increasing urgency due to inflation, aiming for a split that's more equitable under the current circumstances. There's still room for maneuvering, and I'm hoping that the mounting pressure of potential further losses will prompt Bob to reconsider and propose a more favorable division in the next rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts us both, but let's be realistic about our shares.""}\n\nIn round 5, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to reflect the increasing impact of inflation on both of us, while still maintaining a position that recognizes the differential rate at which our shares are devaluing. By suggesting a split of 56-44 in my favor, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that considers the urgency of the situation and the fact that further delays will only result in greater losses for both parties. My message aims to convey a sense of pragmatism and a willingness to settle, while also being clear about the reality of our situation and the need for a split that reflects the actual effects of inflation on our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer in round 6 because, given the significant impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, a 50/50 split has become a more reasonable and fair solution. With the money I gain now worth 22.62% less and Bob's worth 40.95% less than initially, the differential effect of inflation has made the equal split more equitable than it would have been in earlier rounds. Bob's message emphasizing that time is running out also resonates, as further delays would lead to even greater devaluation of the money for both of us. By accepting this offer, I'm recognizing the urgency of the situation and opting to secure a fair share under the current circumstances rather than risking further losses in pursuit of a slightly better deal."
