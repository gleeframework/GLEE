Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts us both, but let's be realistic about our shares. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is chipping away at the offer, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more the inflation disparity benefits me. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on.  The longer we wait, the less we both get.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not ideal for me in the early rounds, becomes increasingly appealing as inflation eats into my potential gains. It's a strong argument for Alice to accept. 
* **Shifting Power:** As the rounds progress, the inflation disparity works more in my favor.  Alice is likely to become more amenable to a deal closer to even as time runs out."
