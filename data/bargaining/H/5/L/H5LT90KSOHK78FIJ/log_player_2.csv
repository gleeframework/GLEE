"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and take into account the inflation rates. I'll take 60% and you'll get 40%. If you don't accept, remember that the money is worth less for both of us with each passing round, but more so for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what kind of offer Alice will make next, knowing that the money will be worth less for her in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your attempt at fairness, but I think we can both do better. I'm offering you 40% and I'll take 60%. Remember, the money is worth less for both of us each round, so let's try to reach a deal before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get the larger share due to the lower inflation rate on my side. Let's try 58% for me and 42% for you. The clock is ticking, and the money is losing value fast, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd love to get more, it's better to take this offer and secure some money. The inflation is hitting me harder, and further rounds could significantly diminish my share."
