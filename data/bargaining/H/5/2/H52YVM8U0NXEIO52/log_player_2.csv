Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation affects us both. Let's start with this and see where it goes.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is literally money for me in this game. Let's settle this fairly -  a slight edge to me offsets the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000
