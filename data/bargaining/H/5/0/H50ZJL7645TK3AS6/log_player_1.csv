This is my initial offer. I am trying to be fair, but I also want to secure the largest share for myself. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially since the value of the money is decreasing for Bob with each passing round. Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for Bob's reduced earning potential due to inflation.  However, I'm still aiming for a larger share as I believe I can get a better deal than what Bob offered in the previous round."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still much worse than my initial proposal, and the inflation is hitting him hard. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round, as the value of his share continues to decrease."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a majority of the money. I believe that Bob will be more motivated to accept an offer as the value of his potential earnings continues to drop."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4880 
# Bob gain: 5120 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is closer to a 50/50 split than previous rounds, the fact that Bob is getting a larger share than me is still unacceptable. The inflation is hitting him hard, and I'm confident that in the next round I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm still holding out for a significant share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling time.  The inflation is heavily impacting Bob's potential earnings, and I'm hoping he'll be more willing to compromise in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5904 
# Bob gain: 4096 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really taking its toll on Bob, and I'm realizing that I need to accept a deal before it's too late.  While I'm not getting my ideal share, this offer is much closer to what I was aiming for than what Bob offered in previous rounds."
