"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us both a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation rate is higher for Alice.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting me harder. I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. This offer is still fair. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, Alice's proposed split doesn't seem to account for the significantly higher devaluation of her share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation on both of us, but especially on Alice. Since her money is worth 36% less, she might be more inclined to accept a slightly more favorable offer for me to avoid further devaluation.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think this split is more reasonable now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're reaching a critical point. This is my final offer. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both shares, especially on Alice's, and considering this is her final offer, accepting this split seems prudent. The difference between our proposals has narrowed, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome for me, especially as inflation continues to devalue the money."
