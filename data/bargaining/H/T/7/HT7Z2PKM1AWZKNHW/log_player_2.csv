"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""My turn to propose a fair deal. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses from inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Favorable to Bob:** This offer gives Bob a slight advantage while still being reasonably close to a 50/50 split. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure and the fact that both players lose money due to inflation with each passing round. This might incentivize Alice to accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than risk getting a worse offer later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle to minimize inflation losses 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Losses:** While not ideal, this offer is better than the initial offer from Alice and avoids further losses from inflation. 
* **Downward Trend:**  Alice's offers have been getting progressively less favorable for Bob. It's unlikely she will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable sum, whereas continuing the game carries the risk of ending up with even less."
