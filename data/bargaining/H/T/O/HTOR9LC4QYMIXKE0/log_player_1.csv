  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 60% and you take 40%. What do you say?""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to flip the script and take the bigger share this time. However, I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal from Bob.
