,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Your offer was a bit unfair, Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Okay, let's try a 65/35 split in my favor.  This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation has hit you harder than me.  Let's end this game.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"This is getting ridiculous, Alice. The inflation is only getting worse for both of us. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day.",Bob,4,
