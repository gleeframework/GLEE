"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting the money I gain, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation effect, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to take a bit more, but still being somewhat generous, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! My gain is worth significantly less now. I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since he's taking a bit more this time, I'll try to hold firm. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation effect continuing to erode the value of my potential gain, I need to be even more cautious. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between taking a reasonable share and not giving Bob too much, considering the inflation."
