"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 4000$ gain is tempting, it's worth considering the inflation.  Rejecting and making a counter-offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal as Alice's money is worth less each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. It's in our best interest to avoid further inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it seems like a good offer on the surface, remember that Alice's money is worth a lot less each round. There's still room for a counter-offer that might benefit Bob more in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can both do better than our last offers.  Let's get closer to a fair split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle on this 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the inflation is becoming very significant.  While Alice's money is worth considerably less, Bob's money is also decreasing in value. Accepting this offer guarantees Bob a gain, and while it's not ideal, it's the best option given the circumstances and the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
