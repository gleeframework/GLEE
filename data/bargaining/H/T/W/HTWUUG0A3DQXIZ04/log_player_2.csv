"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's important to settle this quickly because of the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I can try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split. You'll lose 10% of the value if we go to the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is a factor, but my offer is more than fair considering the potential loss in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I previously offered Alice a 55/45 split, which is the same as her current offer but in reverse. Since I didn't accept her offer of 60/40 and she rejected my 55/45 offer, I believe we should continue negotiating to find a more mutually agreeable split. Additionally, the inflation affects Alice more than me, so I can afford to wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your gains, I believe a 58/42 split is reasonable. The longer we negotiate, the less value you'll receive.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly to avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's gains (34.39% less value than the first round), I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Alice is likely feeling the pressure of the decreasing value and may be willing to compromise further to avoid additional losses. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to wait for a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the substantial impact of inflation on your gains, I'm willing to offer you 40. This is the same split you initially proposed, but now the value is significantly less for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, given the circumstances.""}"
