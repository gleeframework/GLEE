60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's important to settle this quickly because of the inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split. You'll lose 10% of the value if we go to the next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand the inflation is a factor, but my offer is more than fair considering the potential loss in the next round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on your gains, I believe a 58/42 split is reasonable. The longer we negotiate, the less value you'll receive.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,This is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly to avoid further losses for both of us.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Considering the substantial impact of inflation on your gains, I'm willing to offer you 40. This is the same split you initially proposed, but now the value is significantly less for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, given the circumstances.",Bob,6,
