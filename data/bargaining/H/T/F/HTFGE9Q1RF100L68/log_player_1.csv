I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I figure he'll be happy with even a small amount, and it's a good starting point to establish a pattern of cooperation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to stick with my original offer. I'm hoping that Bob will realize he's not going to get a better deal than this, especially considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Bob's offer is still very unfair. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, even though the inflation is starting to hurt."

This is getting ridiculous. I'm not accepting such an unfair deal, even with the inflation. I'll keep fighting for a more equitable split."

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. I'm tired of this back-and-forth and think it's time to find a compromise. With the inflation, I'm not going to be able to get much more than this, and I think Bob might realize that as well."
