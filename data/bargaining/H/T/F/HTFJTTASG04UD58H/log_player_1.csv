"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a risky move, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince him to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I'm happy to accept it. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds, and it's better to take what's on the table than risk getting nothing at all."
