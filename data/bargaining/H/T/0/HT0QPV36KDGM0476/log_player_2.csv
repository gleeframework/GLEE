"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Please let me know when it's my turn to propose a division.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, if I understand the rules correctly, the total value of the money decreases by 20% for me and 5% for Alice with each passing round. Is that right?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split would be more reasonable. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you hard, Bob. I'll be generous and take 65% this time. It's better than what you'll get in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Despite the decreasing value of the money for me, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. The difference in the impact of inflation on us is significant, but I'd like to try and leverage the fact that Alice also loses some value with each round to get a slightly better split.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer. Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I'm willing to consider a slightly less favorable split, but I still believe I can do better than Alice's last offer. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering the heavy inflation hit on my side, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. This is as low as I'm comfortable going.""}"
