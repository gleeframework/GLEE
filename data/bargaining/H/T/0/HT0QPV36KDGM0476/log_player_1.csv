**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor in terms of the raw numbers, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting this offer guarantees Alice a reasonable amount, even with the inflation taken into account. Rejecting it carries a risk:

* **Bob's desperation:**  While he claims this is his lowest offer, the rapidly decreasing value might force him to make a more desperate offer in the next round.
* **Further devaluation:** Waiting any longer means Alice's potential gains continue to shrink.

It's a gamble to hope for a better deal in Round 5, especially as Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation. Accepting now secures a decent outcome in a volatile situation."
