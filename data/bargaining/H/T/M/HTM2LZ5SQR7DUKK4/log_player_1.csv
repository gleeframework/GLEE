"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous in round 1, now it's my turn to make a strong offer 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $10 is actually worth 95% of the original $10, which is $9.50. Bob's gain of $90 is worth 95% of the original $90, which is $85.50.

I don't think I'm getting a good deal here. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm not yet convinced 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me even more. Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Original $100 becomes $86.32 after 3 rounds of inflation (95% * 95% * 85.95% â‰ˆ 81.41% of the original value).
My gain of $30 is worth 34.7% of the original $100, which is approximately $34.70.
Bob's gain of $70 is worth 81.41% of the original $70, which is approximately $56.99.

I'm not getting a good deal here. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get an even larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 50% of the original $100, which is $50, and keeping the other 50% for myself, which is also $50."
