Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to go up to 55/45. It's a fair offer considering the inflation and I believe we can both benefit from ending the game. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
