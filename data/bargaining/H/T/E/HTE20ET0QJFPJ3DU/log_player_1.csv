"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the cash. I'll even throw in a nice dinner!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous amount considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. You take 100000, I take the rest.  It's a better deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering the offer, I'll have to calculate the actual value of the money I'll gain in the current round, taking into account the 20% reduction. Since the money is worth 80% of its original value, I'll gain 80,000 (100,000 * 0.8).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if this is a fair deal, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. The current value of the money is 80% of the original value, so I'll aim to get 80% of the remaining amount.

I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's make a deal! I'll take 80% of the remaining amount, and we can split the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get a significant portion of the remaining money, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic - it's better to split it evenly rather than risk getting nothing at all. I'm willing to take 80% this time. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. The current value of the money is 51.2% of the original value. If Bob's offer is to split it evenly, that means I'll get 51.2% of the remaining amount, which is indeed 512,000.

However, Bob is offering me 200,000, which is less than what I would get from a 51.2% split. Considering the inflation and the fact that I'm getting less than I would from a fair split, I'll have to decide.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if this is the best deal, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. The current value of the money is 51.2% of the original value. I'll aim to get a significant portion of the remaining amount, considering the inflation.

I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and take a smaller share. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the remaining amount, which is a significant portion considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but we need to make a deal before we both lose out. Take 40%, I'll take 60%. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. The current value of the money is 32.77% of the original value. If Bob's offer is to split it 40-60, that means I'll get 40% of the remaining amount, which is indeed 320,000.

However, considering the inflation, I'd rather get a larger share of the remaining amount. I'll have to weigh the risks of rejecting this offer and potentially getting nothing against the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if this is the best deal, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. The current value of the money is 32.77% of the original value. I'll aim to get a significant portion of the remaining amount, considering the inflation.

I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need to get a better deal than 40% of the remaining amount.""
}
```

This way, I'll get a smaller share, but I'll be closer to the amount I'd get from a 40-60 split, considering the inflation."
