Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the time pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean losing out on a significant sum even considering inflation. I'm betting Alice is getting nervous and will offer a better deal in the next round to avoid getting nothing."
