"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  We both have a good chance of getting more in the end if we keep playing, but this is a good middle ground that accounts for the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
