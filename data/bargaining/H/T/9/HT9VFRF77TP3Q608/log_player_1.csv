"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me something.  Waiting another round means a further reduction in my potential gains due to inflation, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything better."
