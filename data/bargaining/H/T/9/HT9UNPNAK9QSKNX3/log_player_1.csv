"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to make a counteroffer. Let's try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 50-50 split just yet, but I'm open to further negotiations. It's my turn to make a new offer."

}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate further."
