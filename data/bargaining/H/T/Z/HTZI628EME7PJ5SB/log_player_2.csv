Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Alice will accept, but I'm ready to negotiate if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a deal that's less favorable than my initial proposal.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 550,000 for me and 450,000 for Alice.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still confident I can get a deal that's better for me than what Alice is offering."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is now offering a 50/50 split.  While the inflation has eaten away at the value of the money, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all if we keep going."
