{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced approach is fair. Let's split it 55-45. It's still a good deal with inflation, and it's more equitable for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I understand you want a fair split, so I'm coming down a bit.  58 for me and 42 for you.  Time is ticking, and this deal benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
