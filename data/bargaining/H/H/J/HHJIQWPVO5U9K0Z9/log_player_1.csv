"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose we split the money 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob. This seems fair, as we'll have 11 more rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to secure a significant portion of the money. 8000 for me and 2000 for Bob seems fair, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to hit hard for Bob. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing later on."
