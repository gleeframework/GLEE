"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%. I'm framing this as a ""fair"" split to see if Bob will accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gains are worth 20% less, so my initial $8000 is now worth $6400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to meet in the middle, as I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since my gains are worth 20% less after the first round, and another 20% less after the second round, my initial $8000 is now worth $5120.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, but I'm still not giving up too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, trying to inch closer to my desired outcome while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my gains are worth 20% less after the first round, another 20% less after the second round, and now 48.8% less after the third round, my initial $8000 is now worth $2560.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think it's fair for me to get only $3000, especially considering the significant erosion of value due to inflation. I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since my gains are worth 20% less after the first round, another 20% less after the second round, and now 48.8% less after the third round, my initial $8000 is now worth $2560.

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you at a 45-55 split, but that's as low as I'll go""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up more than 45% of the remaining value."
