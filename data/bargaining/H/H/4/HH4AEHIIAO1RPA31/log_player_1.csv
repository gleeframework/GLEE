Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in my favor.  It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it establishes a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is a fair offer.  I'm happy to accept and move on."
