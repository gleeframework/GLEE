Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, I'm going to reject this offer. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's still fair given the inflation and the fact that I get to make the offer this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth significantly less due to inflation, a 50/50 split is the fairest offer I've seen so far.  I'm accepting."
