"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation. We both get a good chunk of the money now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is worse for me than my initial offer in Round 1, and it will only get worse for me with each round due to inflation.  I need to incentivize Bob to accept a better deal.
