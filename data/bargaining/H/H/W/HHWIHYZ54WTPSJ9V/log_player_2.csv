"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer is fair in the current round, it's important to consider the inflation. Alice's offer is more advantageous for her in the later rounds, as her money will be worth less due to inflation.  By rejecting, I can ensure I have a chance to make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation. We both get a good chunk of the money now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal for you than last round, and it helps us avoid the increasing inflation penalty. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, accepting this offer ensures I get a substantial amount of money. With further rounds, the value of Alice's gains would decrease significantly due to inflation, making it less attractive for her to continue. This offer is a good compromise that avoids the risk of getting nothing in the end."
