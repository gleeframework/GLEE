"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation rate.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split, considering inflation, is fair.  This allows us both to get a decent share and avoids us risking losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the new offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, the stakes are high, and we don't want to risk losing everything.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'm not giving up yet. I'll keep an eye on the next round and try to negotiate a better deal.
