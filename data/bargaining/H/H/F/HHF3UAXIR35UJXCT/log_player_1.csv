"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or decline!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not 50/50 just yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the new values.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money worth 20% less, I'm not sure if 70 is a good deal for me. However, it's a better offer than the 50/50 split from Round 1.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in Round 2, I'll have to make a new offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger chunk, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate! But Bob's offer is tempting. 75 is a significant portion of the remaining money, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
