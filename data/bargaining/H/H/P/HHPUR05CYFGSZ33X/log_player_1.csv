I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take $8,000, the inflation effect means I'll be losing out in future rounds.  I'm willing to gamble and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more balanced offer this time. I'm willing to reduce my share by $500 to see if Bob is more amenable to a deal.  The inflation is starting to worry me, so I want to secure a decent share before it gets worse!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. The inflation is hitting Bob harder than me, and he's clearly willing to give up more.  While $7,500 isn't as much as I wanted, it's still a good chunk of the money, and the risk of getting nothing at all is becoming real.  I'll take what I can get at this point."
