"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the new values are:

Alice gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000
Bob gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000

I'll reject this offer.
