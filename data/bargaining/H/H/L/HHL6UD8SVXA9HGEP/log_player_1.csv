"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than what I initially proposed. Bob's offer seems fair, but I can do better.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation taking a bigger hit this round, my offer will be more aggressive. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take it this time!"

# Bob gain: 480000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is really biting now, and my gain is worth significantly less than before. I'll have to be more aggressive to get a good deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is my best shot at getting a decent amount of money, considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob will take it!"
