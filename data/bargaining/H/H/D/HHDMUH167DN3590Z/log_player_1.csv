Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can have 60, and I'll take 40. It's still a decent split, considering the money's worth less for me. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
