"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more equitable split.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it for now. I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in my favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60-40 split. I'd like to propose a different split in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round. I need to be more aggressive with my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60-40 in my favor, but I'll give you a bit more than before.""
}
```"
