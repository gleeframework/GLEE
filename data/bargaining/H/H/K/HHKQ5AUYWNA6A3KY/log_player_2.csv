Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation eating into my gains, accepting Alice's offer at this stage would be foolish. She's clearly trying to exploit the situation and secure a larger share. While the time pressure is on, I'm betting she'll be willing to concede a bit more as we get closer to the deadline."

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is getting tight, but Alice is clearly enjoying this too much.  She's still holding out for a much larger share than I think is fair. I'm willing to gamble that she'll crack under the pressure of the shrinking pot as we enter the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not backing down, Bob. You're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game is now incredibly risky.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's far better than walking away with nothing if Alice refuses to budge in the final round. The impact of inflation is substantial at this point, and I need to cut my losses."
