I'm going to propose a very uneven split, giving Bob just $1. I figure he'll be desperate to take it, since otherwise we both get nothing!  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's a fair offer. It's better than getting nothing."
