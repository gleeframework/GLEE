Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, I'm losing value here. Meet me closer to the middle 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to the inflation. We can likely push for an even better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a deal where we both benefit significantly.  Let's close this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to secure a deal, not just optimize for the highest possible gain. This offer is still heavily in Bob's favor given the inflation working against Alice, but it's also generous enough that she might accept before the perceived value drops too low for her."
