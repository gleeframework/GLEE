"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. However, I still want to try to get a decent share.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the first round, and 10% less than in the second round, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to make a deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that.

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth much less, I need to be more cautious and try to get a better deal. However, I don't want to reject this offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
