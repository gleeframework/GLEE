Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option, and we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at everything.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse offer or nothing at all in later rounds."
