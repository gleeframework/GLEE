"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing by 20% each round, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the value of money decreasing by 20% each round, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing rapidly, I need to think strategically. Since Bob is now offering a 50-50 split, it's a relatively fair deal considering the circumstances. I'll accept his offer to avoid further losses.
