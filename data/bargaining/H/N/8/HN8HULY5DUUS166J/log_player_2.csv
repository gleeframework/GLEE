"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation impact on me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's early in the game.  While this offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation rate will affect Alice more strongly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  We both lose more with each round, so fairness is the best way to go.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this.  I'm taking a slightly smaller cut to show I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to account for the faster inflation on my end. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to bite. Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and accepting this offer is the best way to maximize what I get before the inflation makes it worse."
