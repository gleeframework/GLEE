"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to take a slightly larger share this round, as I know the money will be worth less to you in the next round. Let's split it 55/45, I think it's fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
