Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure what you're playing at, Bob. This is getting closer to a reasonable split, but I'm not going to accept unless you budge a bit. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my diminishing returns.  While $2,500 is a tempting offer at this point, accepting it would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even worse offers in the future.  I need to hold strong and show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3000, ""alice_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, last offer. I'm willing to be generous, but this is the best I can do.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the effects of inflation are becoming increasingly severe. It's crucial to secure a deal soon. This offer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable share. If Alice rejects this, I'll need to drastically shift my strategy in the remaining rounds to avoid walking away empty-handed."
