"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but it's the first round and I want to secure a large portion of the money.  Since the money depreciates each round, it's crucial to get a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's a good deal considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. A 50/50 split is fair in this scenario."
