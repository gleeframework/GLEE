I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  I want to maximize my share in the first round, but I'm aware of the inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 272728 
# Bob gain: 727272 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm aware of the inflation and the risk of getting even less in the next round. It's better to secure $272,728 now than risk losing more in the future."
