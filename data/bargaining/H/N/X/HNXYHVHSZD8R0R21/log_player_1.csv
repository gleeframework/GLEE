}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim for a higher share to make up for the loss. I'll reject the offer.
