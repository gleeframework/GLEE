"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 10% less, I'm now looking at a gain of $3,000, which is equivalent to $3,000 / 0.9 = $3,333.33 in the first round's value. Not a bad deal, but I was hoping for a bit more.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round. Since Bob is still not giving up much, I'll...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal. With the money being worth 10% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in favor of Bob this time, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. This is a more balanced offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to move the game forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get closer to my desired share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to calculate the equivalent value of the offer.

The offer is $2,000 for me, but that's equivalent to $2,000 / 0.721 = $2,775.35 in the first round's value. Not a great deal for me.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round. Since Bob is still not giving up much, I'll...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another proposal. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split in favor of Bob this time, with me getting $3,000 and Bob getting $7,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to move the game forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still want a decent share 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit now! With the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'll have to calculate the equivalent value of the offer.

The offer is $1,000 for me, but that's equivalent to $1,000 / 0.5965 = $1,677.41 in the first round's value. This is a very low offer, and I'm starting to feel the pinch.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round. Since Bob is getting desperate, I'll...
