"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'll still let you have 30% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth less than what I initially thought. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. My current gain of $300,000 is worth $285,000 due to inflation, which is a significant reduction. I'd like to aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for inflation!""
}
```
