"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering a slightly better split than my initial offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping to get an even better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time for my next move! Given the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the current value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
