Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was quite fair, Alice. However, considering the inflation working against me, I propose a slightly adjusted split of 51.25% / 48.75%. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
