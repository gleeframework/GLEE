"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $6000 in the first round is now equivalent to $4800 in the second round.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I'm getting less than my initial offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 40% of its original value. My goal is to maximize my gain while taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $10,000, leaving 30% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $6000 in the first round is now equivalent to $3120 in the fourth round.

Comparing Bob's offer to my equivalent gain, I would be getting $3120 if I accepted his offer. This is more than my previous offer of $2800 in the third round (70% of $4000), but less than my initial offer of $6000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
