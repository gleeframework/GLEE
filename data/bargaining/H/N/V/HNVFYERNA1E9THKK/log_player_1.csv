"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much just yet! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60-40 split just yet. I'll try to negotiate for an even better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less for me (20% less twice) and 21% less for Bob (10% less twice).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still being reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 50-50 split is a fair deal, considering the circumstances. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
