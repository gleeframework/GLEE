"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to adjust it to my favor. I'll offer 50/50, but to account for the 10% inflation, I'll actually offer 45/55, so that the effective value of my share is higher.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is even more skewed towards her favor, but I'll try to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 19% less for me now, I'll aim for a higher share. I'll offer 35/65.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth 29% less for me now. I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly higher share, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll offer 38/62.
