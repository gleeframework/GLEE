Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know this is a limited-time offer, so let's not waste time haggling too much.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm taking on a bigger risk with the inflation, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer is fair and gives us both a good chunk.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but your last offer was too far in your favor. This is a compromise - it accounts for the declining value but is still fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
