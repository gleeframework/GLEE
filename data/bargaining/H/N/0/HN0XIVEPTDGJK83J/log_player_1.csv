Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm taking on a bigger risk with the inflation, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer is fair and gives us both a good chunk. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
