6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation working against you. Let's try to settle this quickly.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the inflation I'm facing. We should both get a decent amount.,Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, time is running out and this inflation isn't going away. I'm proposing 58/42.  It's a better deal than what you'll get if you keep holding out.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,I'll propose a 58/42 split in my favor now since my share is worth less due to inflation. We should settle before it gets worse.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm sticking with my original offer of 60/40.  You're losing significant value with each round.  Take the deal!",Alice,5,
