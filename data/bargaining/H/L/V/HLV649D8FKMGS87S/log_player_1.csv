"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money ($900,000) while still giving Bob a significant share ($100,000). I'm aiming to secure a large portion early on, knowing that inflation will decrease the value of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I will reject this offer. While the initial offer was quite favorable to me, the 5% inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains. I am willing to risk another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my initial proposal slightly to try and secure a deal. The inflation has made me more risk-averse, and I believe this offer is still a good deal for me given the circumstances.  I am hoping that Bob will see this as a compromise and accept it."
