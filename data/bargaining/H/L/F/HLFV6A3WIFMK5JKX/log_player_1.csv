"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Accept and we can split the $10 quickly.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 10%. The message is just a friendly nudge to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get a higher percentage to make up for it. However, I don't want to be too greedy, and Bob's offer is a fair one.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
