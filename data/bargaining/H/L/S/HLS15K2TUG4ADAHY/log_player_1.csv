Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm aiming for a large share early on, knowing the value will decrease with each round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob's offer is significantly better for him, it's still only a 10/90 split.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I get to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering an 80/20 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to give up some of my initial gain from the first round, I'm still aiming for a majority share.  Inflation is going to hurt us both more with each passing round, so I'm hoping to secure a decent amount before things get too bad."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While the value of the money is decreasing, I'm still hoping to secure a larger share.  I believe I can get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor.  I'm still hoping for a large share, but recognizing the increasing impact of inflation. I'm also trying to be somewhat fair, as we're getting close to the midpoint of the game."
