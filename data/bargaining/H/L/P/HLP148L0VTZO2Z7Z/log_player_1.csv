"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this offer and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the majority of the money. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me with his new offer.

I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be strategic about my decision.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable, I'll try to make a new proposal that's more beneficial to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal than my previous offer, but I'm not going to give you the majority of the money. Let's see if you'll accept this one!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. This is a 55-45 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the majority of the money. I'm trying to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me.

Considering the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be careful not to give up too much. However, this offer is slightly better than my previous one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
