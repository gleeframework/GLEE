"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We both get half the money. Accept and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain would be $50 * 0.8 = $40, and Bob's gain would be $50.

I'm not sure if I want to give up $40, so I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my gain would be $40 * 0.8 = $32.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be generous, Bob. Accept and let's move on!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but if you reject, I'll take a bigger share in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less now, my gain would be $40 / 0.5208 = $76.92, which is actually more than what I initially thought. But, I'll stick to the original numbers.

I'm not sure if I want to give up $40, so I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less again, my gain would be $76.92 * 0.8 = $61.94.

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic, Bob. You're getting the bigger share this time.""
}
```"
