"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can wrap up the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise and split it down the middle, Alice. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the previous round, which is $5700 (5% less than $6000).

I'm not thrilled about splitting it down the middle, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'd rather not risk going to another round with further inflation.
