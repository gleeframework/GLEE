"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original amount, which is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it 50/50, which is a fair offer, but considering the inflation, I'd rather get a bit more. However, it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money before it loses more value.
