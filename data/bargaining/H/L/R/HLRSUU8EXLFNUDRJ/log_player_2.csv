Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I can tell. My offer is better than what you'll get next round 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

* **Current Offer:** I get $43 (worth only ~$28 due to inflation), Alice gets $57.
* **Next Round (My Offer):** Assuming inflation keeps shrinking my share at 10%,  the most I can offer myself next round and still seem reasonable is around $47 (and even that's pushing it). That would be worth about ~$31 after inflation. 

Alice is being ruthless, but she's kind of right.  I'm unlikely to secure a better deal in the next round.
