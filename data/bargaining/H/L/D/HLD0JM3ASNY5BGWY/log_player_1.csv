"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. It's a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can avoid the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, he's effectively offering me $4,500 (5000 / 0.9) and keeping $4,500 for himself. It's still a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure if I want to give up half the money. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less from the previous round), I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. It's a bit more skewed towards me, but I hope he'll accept it to avoid further losses due to inflation."
