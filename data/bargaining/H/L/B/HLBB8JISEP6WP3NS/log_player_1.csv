Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll receive in this round.

My share: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's share: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56 (due to 10% inflation)

Considering this, I'll reject the offer.
