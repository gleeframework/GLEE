"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm the one who's really doing all the work here 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 20% less than the original 500,000, so I'm looking at 400,000. Bob's share is still 800,000.

Considering the message, it seems like Bob is trying to justify a larger share for himself. I'm not convinced that he's doing all the work, but I don't want to risk waiting too long and losing more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer for now.
