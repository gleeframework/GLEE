"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the first to offer, and I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share to avoid risking further rounds and potential loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 36 
# Bob gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant gain for me, it's still less than what I initially proposed, and I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of further inflation. I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, acknowledging Bob's rejection, but still securing a larger share. I hope this will be more appealing to Bob, as the risk of further inflation increases with each passing round."
