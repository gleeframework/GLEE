"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about inflation, but 60/40 is too skewed in your favor. I propose a 55/45 split. This gives me a slight advantage to compensate for the inflation difference, but it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
