Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the potential for inflation to affect you more harshly in the next round.

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand your point about inflation, but 60/40 is too skewed in your favor. I propose a 55/45 split. This gives me a slight advantage to compensate for the inflation difference, but it's still a good deal for you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option given the changing value of money. It avoids the risk of further negotiations and ensures we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
