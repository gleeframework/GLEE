6000.0,4000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the potential for inflation to affect you more harshly in the next round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I understand your point about inflation, but 60/40 is too skewed in your favor. I propose a 55/45 split. This gives me a slight advantage to compensate for the inflation difference, but it's still a good deal for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it evenly this time. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option given the changing value of money. It avoids the risk of further negotiations and ensures we both get a good deal.,Alice,3,
