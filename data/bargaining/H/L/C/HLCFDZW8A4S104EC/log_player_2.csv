"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what Alice offers in the next round.  1000$ is not a lot to start with, and I'm hoping for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering I'll be the one taking the risk of rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is being stubborn. I'm still confident I can get a better deal than 3000, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable solution, and hopefully, Alice will recognize that it's in her best interest to accept.  We are both losing money with each passing round."
