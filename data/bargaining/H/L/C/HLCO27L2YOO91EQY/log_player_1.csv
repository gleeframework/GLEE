"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to get started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is 10,000, but the value of the money is already decreasing due to inflation. I'll have to consider the future value of the money when making my decision.

Considering the offer, I'll have to weigh the immediate gain of $4000 against the potential future value of the money. Since I don't know the impact of inflation on Bob's perception of value, I'll have to make a decision based on my own understanding of the situation.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still need to be reasonable.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money worth 14.26% less than the initial amount, I need to be careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up a significant portion of the money, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his end of the bargain.
