Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it seems like a ""fair"" offer considering the inflation, it's still a very unbalanced split. It's worth pushing for a more equitable division, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains.""}
