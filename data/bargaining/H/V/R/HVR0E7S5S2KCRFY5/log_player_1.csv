"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm making the first offer, proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I've attached the message ""Let's divide fairly"" to encourage Bob to accept this reasonable offer. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, fair and simple. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer to split the money evenly. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I'd be losing more value in the next rounds if we don't come to an agreement soon. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split""}\n\nI'm making a new offer, taking into account the inflation that affects both of us. I propose that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split"" aims to reason with Bob about the impact of inflation on our potential gains, hoping he'll see the logic in accepting this adjusted offer. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly higher split for me is fair, considering inflation is hitting us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although Bob is right that inflation is affecting both of us, his proposed split doesn't accurately reflect the differing rates at which our potential gains are decreasing. With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob compared to the first round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to find a mutually acceptable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Inflation affects us differently, let's adjust accordingly""}\n\nI'm making a new offer, considering the increasing impact of inflation on both our potential gains, but also acknowledging that it affects Bob more significantly. I propose that I receive $520,000 and Bob receives $480,000. The message ""Inflation affects us differently, let's adjust accordingly"" aims to highlight the different rates at which our potential gains are decreasing due to inflation, hoping Bob will accept this offer as a reasonable adjustment. Your turn!"
