Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not that big! You can't have it all, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is offering a pretty good deal, and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation. Let's take it!"
