"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to compromise and give you a decent amount. It's still a good deal for you, and you can try to do better next round. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
