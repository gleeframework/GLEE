# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hitting Bob hard. While Alice's offer is getting progressively worse for Bob, it's better to hold out a bit longer and hope she becomes more reasonable. There's still a chance to secure a better deal."

# Alice's message: I'm not budging much! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is becoming critical.  While this is the same offer Alice made in round 1, Bob is getting a drastically smaller percentage of the original amount due to inflation. Accepting a bad offer is better than getting nothing in the later rounds."
