"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a good deal for you 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get $2000, which is 20% of the original $10,000, but it's still a decent amount.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80-20 in his favor, I'll try to push for a more even split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is closer to an even split than the previous offers. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons. I'll get $4000, but it's still a bit less than what I was hoping for. However, it's a decent offer considering the inflation.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to push for an even more even split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is as even as it gets. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
