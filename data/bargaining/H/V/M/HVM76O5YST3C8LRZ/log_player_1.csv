"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is $20. I'm taking the remaining 80%. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you accept 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $60 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $54.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more, but Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $60 is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $48.60.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45, and taking the remaining 55%. I'm hoping this is more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's see if we can finally agree 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $55 is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $39.95.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Meeting halfway is a good gesture, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get.

However, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I think it's getting increasingly difficult to wait for a better offer.
