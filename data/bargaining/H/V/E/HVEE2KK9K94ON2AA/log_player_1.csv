"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, I'll get the majority, but it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the money to account for potential future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's go 51/49, that way we both get a good share! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less, so I'd get $49.45 instead of $51.

I'm not thrilled about the 51/49 split, but it's a more even split than my initial offer, and it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money. I'll accept this offer.
