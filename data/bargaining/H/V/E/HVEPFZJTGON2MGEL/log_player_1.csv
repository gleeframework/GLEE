"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, I'll have to think strategically considering the inflation effect.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather get more money now than later. However, Bob's offer is not as generous as the 50/50 split I initially proposed.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll try to take into account the inflation effect on Bob's offer from round 2. Since the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll aim to make a more aggressive offer.

Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 4, I'll consider the increasing inflation rate and the fact that the money Bob gains is now worth significantly less than in the first round.

Bob's offer is still not as generous as my initial 50/50 split, but it's getting closer. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
