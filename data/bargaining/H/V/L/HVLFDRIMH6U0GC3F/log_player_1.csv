"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a decent amount for your part.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the money, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I deserve more for my part 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer. The 20$ I'll get is worth significantly less than the 30$ I could have gotten in the first round, and Bob is getting 80$ which is 80% of the remaining money, which is a lot.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, we can both get a fair share.""
}
```

This way, we'll both get 50% of the remaining money, which is a reasonable compromise given the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit more, but I need more for my efforts 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than its original value, I need to be even more cautious. However, I think 40% is a relatively decent share, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to negotiate in future rounds.
