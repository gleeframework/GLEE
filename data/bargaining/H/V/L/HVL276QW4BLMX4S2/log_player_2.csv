"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I propose I take $6000, and you get $4000.  It's important to reach a deal quickly because the value decreases over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 55/45 split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  Let's be practical and split this evenly at $5000 each.  Each round that passes hurts us both, though it hurts me more.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to resolve this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
