I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a reasonable split now, I know the money will be worth less to me in future rounds.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a smaller share now, but I need a larger share in the future to make up for the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is offering a bit more, it's still not enough to compensate for the inflation. I'm going to keep pushing for a more favorable deal."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I understand we are running out of time, but I need a larger share to compensate for the substantial inflation. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal."
