"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his gain of $600,000 is equivalent to $480,000 in the first round. That's a significant difference from the 50/50 split I initially proposed.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the ratio to 55/45 in my favor, but still offering Bob a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now equivalent to a gain of $420,000 in the first round, which is a significant reduction from the $600,000 he offered in round 2.

I'll consider this offer. Since I'm getting a slightly better deal than in round 3, I'll accept this offer.
