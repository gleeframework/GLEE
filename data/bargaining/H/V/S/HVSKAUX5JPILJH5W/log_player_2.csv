{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the time pressure and inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still holding most of the value.  Let's make a deal before the inflation gets out of control. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is starting to become a factor, but it's not yet at a panic level. I'll hold out for a better deal in the next round, aiming for a split closer to 60/40."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still in control. This offer is more generous than the last one, and the inflation is working against both of us.  Time is of the essence. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but this offer is still unacceptable. Accepting 200,000 now is a significant loss compared to even my previous offer, which she rejected. While the inflation is increasing, there's still time, and accepting a bad deal now just because of the pressure would be a mistake. I need to make it clear I'm serious about getting a fairer share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm standing firm. This is a 55/45 split in my favor.  The inflation is eating into my share with every passing round, and I'm not going to accept an unfair deal. Let's be realistic and close this.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hurting us both, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  Let's reach an agreement before we both lose out completely. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation as leverage, but this offer is still not good enough.  While 300,000 is a decent sum, it's significantly less than what I was aiming for, and the inflation means it's worth even less than it seems.  We are past the halfway point, but I'm willing to risk it for a better deal. I need to show Alice I'm serious about not settling for less than a reasonable share."

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is non-negotiable. We split it 50/50 or we both walk away with nothing. The inflation is becoming critical, and I'm not going to accept anything less than an even split. It's time to be fair and end this.""}
