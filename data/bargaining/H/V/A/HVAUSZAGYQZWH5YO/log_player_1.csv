"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI offered to take $55 and leave $45 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, considering I'm taking only a slightly larger share. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob offered me $45 and wants to take $55 for himself, with the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I will reject this offer. I initially proposed a similar split in my favor, so I'll wait for a better opportunity.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Bob also proposed a similar split in his favor, I'll make a slightly more generous offer this time to try and reach an agreement before the value of the money decreases further.
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and be done with it.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
