"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll consider it. The inflation is eating away at my potential gain, so I need to think strategically.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to counter with a new offer that takes into account the inflation and the previous rejection. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to account for the inflation!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
