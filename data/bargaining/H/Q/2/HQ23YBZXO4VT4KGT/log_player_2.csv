Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't be greedy! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While time is ticking, Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting her more than me, so she'll be getting desperate soon. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats our profits!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Offering a 50/50 split is the fairest option and highlights the urgency of the situation. By now, Alice should be feeling the pressure of the devaluing money and realize that a deal is better than nothing."
