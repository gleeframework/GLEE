"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob.  I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money as time goes on, but you lose it at a much faster rate. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair initially, considering the inflation rates, it's much more advantageous for me to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this split is more fair, given the inflation rates we're facing. We both lose value, but I'm losing it much faster.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my previous offer was more than fair. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't accept a deal where I lose so much value. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, considering the inflation and the fact that Alice's offer is her final one, it's best to accept and avoid further risk of losing value."
