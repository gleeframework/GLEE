"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 90/10, I'll try to propose a more favorable split for myself. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher percentage. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Since Alice's offer is still relatively close to the original 90/10 split, I'll accept it.
