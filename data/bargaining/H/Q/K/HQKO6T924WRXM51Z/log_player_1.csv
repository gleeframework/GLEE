"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation taken into account.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm going to propose a 72/28 split in my favor. This takes into account the inflation and is a more balanced offer than Bob's previous proposal. I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair compromise."
