Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the money quickly and avoid the potential impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  Inflation will only continue to eat away at the value of the money, and Bob's offer is fair, especially given the inflation effects."
