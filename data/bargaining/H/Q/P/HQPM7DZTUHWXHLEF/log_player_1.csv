"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see how it goes.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3800 now (since it's 5% less than the original $4000). I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a 40/60 split, especially since I don't know how much the inflation affects Bob's gain.

I'll reject this offer for now.
