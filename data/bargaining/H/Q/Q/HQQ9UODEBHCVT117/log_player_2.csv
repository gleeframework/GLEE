"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is fair in the current round, it's important to consider the inflation.  By rejecting, I get the opportunity to make a proposal that benefits me more in the next round. I can capitalize on the declining value of money to secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly, considering the potential inflation in future rounds.  Let's both take a bit more now so we have more to work with later.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's maintain an equal split to ensure fairness for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now a more even split, which is appealing. While I could reject and try for a higher share, the inflation rate is significant. This offer ensures I get a reasonable amount, and there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's a calculated risk, and accepting is the safer option."
