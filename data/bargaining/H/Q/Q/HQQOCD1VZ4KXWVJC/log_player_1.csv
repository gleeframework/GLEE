Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're not satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. This is a fair deal for both of us, given the inflation.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 60% is a fairer split given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing at all if the game continues. Bob's offer is still significantly more than what he proposed in round 2, and given the increasing inflation affecting him more heavily, it's likely he won't offer more in future rounds. Accepting now secures a decent share of the money."
