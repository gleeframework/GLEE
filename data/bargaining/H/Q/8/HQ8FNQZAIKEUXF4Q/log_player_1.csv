"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60/40""}\n\nI'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Since there's no inflation in the first round, the money is still worth its full value to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split was a little uneven. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me, but still advantageous for you before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the offer seems reasonable, considering the inflation, my gain of $5500 in the second round is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that Bob will accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's compromise.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of my potential gain. I'm offering a compromise that is closer to Bob's previous offer but still slightly in my favor, hoping he will accept it before the value of the money decreases further for me."
