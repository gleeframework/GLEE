Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth a lot. This offer gives us both a good deal.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is going down each round. This offer is still good for both of us, but we need to act fast. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It seems like Alice is right. The money is losing value quickly, and this is a decent deal for me. Let's accept."
