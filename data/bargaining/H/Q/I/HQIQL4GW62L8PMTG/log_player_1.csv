I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, aiming to get as much of the money as possible. Since the money inflates, I want to secure my share as quickly as possible.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I initially aimed for a larger share, the inflation factor makes this a very reasonable offer. I'm getting a 50% split, which is much better than what I would have received in the next round. This is a good outcome considering the circumstances."
