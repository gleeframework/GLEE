"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split of $55 for me and $45 for you. While we both lose some value over time, this offer is more fair and allows us to end the game sooner. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
