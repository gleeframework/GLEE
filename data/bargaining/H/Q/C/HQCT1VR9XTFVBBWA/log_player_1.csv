"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: Let's start with a compromise, I think we can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it.
