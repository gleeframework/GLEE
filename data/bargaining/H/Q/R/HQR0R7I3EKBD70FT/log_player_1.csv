Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more equitable split is 55/45 in my favor. This acknowledges the diminishing value of money but also offers you a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
