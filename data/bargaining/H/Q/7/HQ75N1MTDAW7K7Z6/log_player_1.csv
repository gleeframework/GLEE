"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Since the money is worth less to him with each round, he'll likely accept a smaller share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $10, remember that the money is worth less each round. Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer was for him, and I know he's feeling the pressure of inflation too. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, knowing that his money is worth less with each round. I'm hoping this slightly smaller offer will make him realize that it's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $20, remember that the money is worth significantly less now. Bob's offer is even worse for me than his previous offer, and I'm still feeling the pressure of inflation too. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my offer to Bob, but at a slower pace. His money is worth less with each round, and I'm hoping this slight reduction will make him realize that it's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all, especially with the time running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $30, remember that the money is worth significantly less now. Bob's offer is worse for me than his previous offer, and I'm still feeling the pressure of inflation too.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  With so few rounds left, Bob needs to start making concessions if he wants to get anything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly.  Time is running out, and I know Bob is feeling the heat from inflation.  This offer is a bit more risky for me, but it's still the best chance I have at securing a deal before the clock runs out."
