"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you'll get $4,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'll still give you a decent chunk. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll need to reassess the offer.

In this round, I'd gain $2,000 and Bob would gain $8,000. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not too thrilled about the proposal.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on the split. I'll take $5,500 and you'll get $4,500. Let's wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a reasonable offer considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. With the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be even more cautious.

In this round, I'd gain $3,000 and Bob would gain $7,000. Considering the significant reduction in value, I'm not thrilled about the proposal.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'll take $5,000 and you'll get $5,000. It's a 50-50 split, but I think it's a fair deal given the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
