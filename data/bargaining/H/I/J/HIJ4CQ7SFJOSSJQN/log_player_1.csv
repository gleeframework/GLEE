"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly suggestion to start with a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
