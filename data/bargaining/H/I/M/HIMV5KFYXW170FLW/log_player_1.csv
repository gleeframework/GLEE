I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor. Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'm raising my share slightly to account for the increasing inflation."
