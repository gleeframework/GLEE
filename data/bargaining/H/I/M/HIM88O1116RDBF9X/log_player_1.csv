{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split, considering the inflation factor. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. This way, we both get something good.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split. This recognizes the inflation disadvantage you face, giving you a significant portion upfront. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
