"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great offer for me! I'll reject it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer takes into account the 10% decrease in value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! 

I'll analyze Bob's new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the effective value of the offer. 

Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me, I'll divide Bob's offer by 0.271 to get the effective value in terms of the original money. 

450,000 / 0.271 ≈ 166,024.52

Similarly, for Bob, the money is worth 48.8% less, so I'll divide his offer by 0.482 to get the effective value in terms of the original money.

550,000 / 0.482 ≈ 114,035.26

Considering the effective values, Bob's offer is still quite generous to him. However, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 315000,
  ""bob_gain"": 685000
}
```

This offer should be more in line with the decreasing value of the money."
