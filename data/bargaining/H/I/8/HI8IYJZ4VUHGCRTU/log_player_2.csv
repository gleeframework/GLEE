"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but leave you a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is tempting, it's too early to accept. I want to see if I can get a better deal later in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair. It gives you a good share, and I'm willing to take a bit less to avoid risking getting nothing in later rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but we need to come to an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and the deal is significantly better than what I was offered in the first round.  It's also close to my own proposal, so I'm willing to accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing later on."
