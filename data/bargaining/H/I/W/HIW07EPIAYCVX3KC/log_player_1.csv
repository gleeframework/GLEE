"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can discuss further if you want to.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, that way we both get a good start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd rather take more in this round to make up for the loss in value. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more to make up for it. Let's see what you think.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With the inflation, I think a more balanced split is more fair. This way we can both still get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and I need to adjust my strategy accordingly. Considering the decreased value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than mine was in round 3.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
