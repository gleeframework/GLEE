"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering him a smaller share in the first round. This way, if Bob accepts, I'll get a larger portion before the value of money starts decreasing for him. If Bob declines, we'll move to the next round, where he'll make an offer, but the money will be worth 5% less to him, which might pressure him into making a more favorable offer for me in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this offer prevents further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the value of money has decreased by 5% for him, his proposed split doesn't seem to take that into sufficient account. Given that the value of money remains the same for me, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, especially considering the impact of inflation on Bob's share in subsequent rounds. By rejecting, I'm hoping that in the next round, I can either propose a split that's more favorable to me or that Bob will feel pressured to offer a better deal due to the continuing devaluation of his potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair for both""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $42 and taking $58 for myself, emphasizing in the message that this split is more than fair, especially when considering the impact of inflation on Bob's share. Since the value of money decreases by 5% for Bob with each round, his potential gain is actually less in real terms than the nominal amount suggests. I'm trying to use this to my advantage by offering him a slightly smaller share than before, while still presenting it as a fair deal. The aim is to either get Bob to accept this offer, securing a larger share for myself, or to pressure him into making an even more favorable offer in the next round, should he choose to reject this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  The value will only decrease further for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given that the value of money has decreased by 14.26% for Bob since the first round, but remains unchanged for me, a 50/50 split at this point is actually more favorable to me than the initial split I proposed. Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, implying that he might be willing to walk away or significantly decrease his offer in the next round, which could lead to an unfavorable outcome for both of us. By accepting the 50/50 split, I'm securing a fair share of the money without risking further negotiations that could lead to a worse deal. Additionally, since the value of money doesn't decrease for me, I'm essentially getting a better deal in real terms than Bob, considering the impact of inflation on his share."
