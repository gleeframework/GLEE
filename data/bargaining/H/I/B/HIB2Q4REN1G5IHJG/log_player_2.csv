"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can negotiate further if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather take my chances on a better offer in the next round. The 20% inflation rate for me is steep, but I think I can get a better deal than 10% of the original amount. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation, 40% seems fair for me, and you still get the bigger share.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the steeper inflation rate affecting me. Starting from Alice's initial 90% offer, I've adjusted the proportions to reflect the impact of inflation on both of us, aiming for a more balanced division that acknowledges my higher inflation rate. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit further, Bob.  70/30 seems like a fair split considering inflation has hit us both. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice has moved closer to a compromise, I still believe the offer doesn't adequately account for the significant impact of inflation on my share. Given that the money I gain is now worth 36% less than initially, I think I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round. The gap between our inflation rates is considerable, and I'd like to see if I can leverage that for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant hit I'm taking from inflation, I'm hoping we can meet closer to the middle. This offer reflects the differing impacts of inflation on us.""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, I've taken a firmer stance, aiming to secure a larger share that offsets the substantial loss in value due to inflation. Given that Alice's inflation rate is lower, I'm hoping she'll be more willing to compromise and accept a deal that's still favorable to her but also more balanced in light of our respective inflation rates."
