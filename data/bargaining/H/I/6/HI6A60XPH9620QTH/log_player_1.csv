Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's still a decent amount for him. However, if he rejects it, I'm hoping that the threat of inflation will encourage him to be more reasonable in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly less than what I was initially hoping for. Given the inflation, I think I can do better if I wait for another round. It's still early in the game, and there's a chance I can secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a majority.  Bob has shown that he's willing to negotiate, but I believe that the looming inflation will motivate him to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a pretty good deal, and it's getting more risky to keep rejecting offers. With the inflation, Bob's offer is likely to decrease significantly in future rounds. It's better to take the 50% now while it's still a decent amount."
