"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was tempting, but I think we can find a solution that benefits us both more in the long run. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 5% less in this round, the $4,500 offered by Bob is actually worth $4,275. And for Bob, the $5,500 he's offering himself is actually worth $4,950 due to the 10% decrease in value. Considering this, I think I can do better in the next round, so I'll reject Bob's offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new proposal to Bob. Here it is:
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I think 58-42 is a better split, considering the inflation. What do you think, Bob?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince we've already established the pattern of decreasing value due to inflation, let's recalculate the values for this round. For me, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll keep that in mind when making my offer. Here's my revised proposal:
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I think 58-42 is a better split, considering the inflation. What do you think, Bob?""}"
