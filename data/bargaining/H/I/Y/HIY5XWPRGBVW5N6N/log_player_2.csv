"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a bit longer. The longer she waits, the more the inflation will eat into her potential gains, making her more likely to accept a deal where I get a slightly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is fair and avoids significant losses from inflation for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference, last reasonable offer 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The game is reaching a critical point. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures I get something that's still reasonably close to my target split.  The alternative is risking getting a much worse deal or even nothing as the rounds progress and inflation eats further into the pot."
