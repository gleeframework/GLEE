"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
I'm going for a generous (but not foolish) offer in the first round.  I want to establish a pattern of fairness, hoping Bob will reciprocate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's clear he's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm offering a split that's closer to 50/50, but still accounts for the inflation factor.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and the inflation is really hurting my potential gains.  I'm going to continue to reject these unbalanced offers, hoping to force him to compromise in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000} 
```

I'm offering a split that's still slightly in Bob's favor, acknowledging the inflation's impact on my gains. I believe this offer shows a willingness to compromise, while still trying to secure a decent portion of the remaining money."
