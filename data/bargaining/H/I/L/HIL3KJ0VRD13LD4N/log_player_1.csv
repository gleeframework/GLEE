"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is fair. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think the split is still a bit skewed towards Bob, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
