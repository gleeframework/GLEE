"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. Take 100k, and I'll take the rest. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept such a small portion. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40, with me taking 600k and you taking 400k. This seems like a fair and equitable starting point, given the potential for inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer. Let's split the money 60/40 with me taking 600k. It's a better deal than the last round, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get 600k, given the inflation and the fact that Alice is now proposing the same offer as my last one, accepting seems like the best option to avoid further losses."
