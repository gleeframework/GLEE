"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40, with me taking 600k and you taking 400k. This seems like a fair and equitable starting point, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
