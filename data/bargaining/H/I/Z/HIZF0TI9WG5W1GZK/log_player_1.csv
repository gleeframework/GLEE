I propose to keep $5500 and give Bob $4500. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a smaller share, accounting for his higher rate of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I propose a 50/50 split.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I believe this demonstrates that he values a higher share.  This offer offers a fair compromise while accounting for the inflation we are both experiencing."
