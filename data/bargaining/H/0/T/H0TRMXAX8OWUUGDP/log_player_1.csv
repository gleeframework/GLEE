"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I think I deserve more for my skills and experience.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000. My message is to set the tone for the negotiation, hinting that I'm willing to be generous, but also confident in my own worth."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I'm still being shortchanged. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I need a bit more to account for the risk I'm taking.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

# Alice gain: 450000

}
