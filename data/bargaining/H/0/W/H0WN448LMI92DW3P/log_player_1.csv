"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation rate is higher for me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I think 40 is a bit low for me. I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 50/50 split, considering the inflation rates.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more attractive offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
