"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a 60/40 split, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain in the second round as 90% of $600,000, which is $540,000.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant improvement from the initial 60/40 split. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer.
