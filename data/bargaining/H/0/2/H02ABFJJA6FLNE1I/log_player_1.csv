Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80-20 split, where I receive 800,000 and you receive 200,000. This ensures a fair distribution while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the declining value of money for me in future rounds while still offering you a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
