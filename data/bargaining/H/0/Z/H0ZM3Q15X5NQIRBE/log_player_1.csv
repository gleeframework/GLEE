"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain would be $4800 instead of $6000, and Bob's gain would be $6400 instead of $8000.

I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, considering the initial proposal. I'd like to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I was hoping for a more balanced split. Let's try again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my gain would be $3840 instead of $4800.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain would be $1920 instead of $6000.

I think Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the imbalance in this offer. Let's keep negotiating.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less again, my gain would be $960.96 instead of $1920.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
