Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the initial offer was very favorable to me (Alice), I should accept this offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is worth less with each round. Even though the offer is less than my initial proposal, it's still a significant gain. 
* **Risk of Rejection:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob proposing an even less favorable split in the next round.  

It's better to secure a good gain now rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
