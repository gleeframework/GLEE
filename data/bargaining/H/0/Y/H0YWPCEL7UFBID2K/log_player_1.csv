"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the initial amount, and I'll take the remaining 60%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to consider the offer in terms of its value in the previous round.

In the previous round, I was offered 600,000 dollars, which is now worth 80% of its original value. This offer from Bob is 50% of that amount, which is 300,000 dollars. In terms of its original value, that's equivalent to 40% of the original 600,000 dollars.

Considering the offer from Bob is slightly smaller than my original offer, but still a significant amount, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000 dollars, which is 58% of the current value of the money, and I'll take the remaining 42%. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the offer in terms of the original amount. The original amount was $1,000,000, and after 3 rounds of inflation, the money is worth 80% of its original value for me and 71.9% of its original value for Bob.

In terms of the original amount, Bob's offer is:
Alice gain: 350,000 / 0.8 = 437,500 (in terms of the original amount)
Bob gain: 650,000 / 0.719 = 901,039 (in terms of the original amount)

Since the original offer from round 1 was 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Bob, this offer is not as favorable for me. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth 38.4% of its original value for me. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 520,000 dollars, which is 52% of the current value of the money, and I'll take the remaining 48%. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob!"
