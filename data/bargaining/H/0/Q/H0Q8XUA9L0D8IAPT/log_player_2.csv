"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to compromise later.

# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still believe I deserve a bigger share. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to a fair split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting her more than me, so I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""The inflation is working against you, Alice. I'm offering a fair split, take it before it shrinks even further!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly. It's clear we're both stubborn, and the money is shrinking fast. We can both get a decent share if we agree now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  A 50/50 split is fair and ensures I get a substantial amount.  While I could potentially push for more, the ongoing inflation means the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of walking away with nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
