"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust later if you want to play nice. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven offer! I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a small share. Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice! Let's split it 60/40.  A good deal for you before inflation eats away at it!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, Bob, but 60/40 is still too much. Let's split it 70/30.  We can still get a good amount if we agree now. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is moving in the right direction, that's still a big chunk of the pie she's keeping. I'm hoping she gets the message that I'm serious about a fairer split.  The pressure from inflation is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be reasonable. 55/45 seems fair.  Inflation is chipping away, so let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'll go down to 6000, but I really need a better deal than 55/45. Let's split it 60/40.  This is a fair compromise before the money shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally budging significantly, and the effects of inflation are getting serious. Taking 40% now is better than risking getting a worse deal later, or even worse, walking away with nothing.  Let's make a deal!"
