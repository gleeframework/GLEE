"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money Bob gains. With 10% less value, $600,000 is worth less than the $500,000 I initially proposed.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money Bob gains. With 27.1% less value, $700,000 is worth less than the $500,000 I initially proposed.

However, I'm getting a bit worried about the time left, and the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept Bob's offer in the hopes of getting something rather than risking getting nothing.
