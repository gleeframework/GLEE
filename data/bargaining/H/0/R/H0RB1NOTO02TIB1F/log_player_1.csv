"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 4:1 ratio. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point and Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get $5000. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $4750.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. If we split the money evenly, I'll end up with $4750, which is less than my initial offer of $8000. However, it's also more than the $4000 I would get if I were to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
