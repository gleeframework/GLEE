"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still leaving you with a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain of $2000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll have to consider that.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be strategic about my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I'm hoping for a bit more for myself this round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to negotiate a decent amount for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still doing better than before 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I'll have to calculate the actual value of my potential gain. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $4000, which is worth 72.9% of the original $4000 (since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%). That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll have to be even more strategic about my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to give you a larger share to move forward.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an even larger share, hoping to get the game moving and avoid further erosion of my potential gains. Your turn, Bob!"
