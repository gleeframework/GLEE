"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. This is a relatively fair split, considering we have 11 more rounds to go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations. However, Bob's offer is still quite similar to the one I made in Round 1, but with the money being worth less.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
