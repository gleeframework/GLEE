Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A 55/45 split seems reasonable considering the inflation.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I may be able to negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation affecting Alice's valuation of the money. Since the money is worth 10% less to her now, I can try to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is a good compromise considering time is running out for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because the difference from my previous offer is minimal, and I believe I can get an even better deal in the next round, considering the increasing effect of inflation on Alice's valuation of the money."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the growing impact of inflation on Alice's side. Since the money is now worth 19% less to her than in the first round, and this effect will continue, I can try to push for an even more favorable split.
