"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 0.95 * 40 = 38.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the next round of inflation, my gain will be worth 5% less than 38, so it's 0.95 * 38 = 36.2.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a larger share this time, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}"
