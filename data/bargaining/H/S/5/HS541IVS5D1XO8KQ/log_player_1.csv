"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk of change. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that.  Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 20% less, I'm now looking at a gain of 360,000 (80% of 450,000). That's a significant reduction.

I'm not thrilled about the 45% share, but I don't want to keep negotiating and risk losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
