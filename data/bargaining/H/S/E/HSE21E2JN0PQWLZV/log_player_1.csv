"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I'm also sending a message to Bob to let him know that I'm willing to start the negotiations and see if we can come to an agreement."
