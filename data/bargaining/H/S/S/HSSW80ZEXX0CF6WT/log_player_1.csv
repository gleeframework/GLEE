"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking $90 and leaving $10 for Bob. This seems fair, as I am the one making the offer and taking a larger share. However, I want to be sure to leave him with something so he doesn't feel like he has nothing to gain by accepting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I am losing money due to inflation, I am still confident that I can secure a better deal than this. I have 11 rounds left, and I know that Bob will be losing money as well, even though at a lower rate than I am."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28} 
```

I'm proposing a 72/28 split in my favor. I'm still losing money from inflation, but I need to make sure I get a decent share. By offering Bob a slightly higher share than before, I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept the deal."
