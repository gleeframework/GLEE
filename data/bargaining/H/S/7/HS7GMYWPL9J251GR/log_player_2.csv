"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this deal gets worse for you every round. Let's be sensible and split it fairly. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, it's better than what you'll get next round!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're feeling the inflation more than I am. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer avoids further losses due to the declining value of the money. 

Here's why:

* **Further Rounds:**  Delaying further hurts Bob more than Alice. 
* **Alice's Position:**  Her ""final offer"" language suggests she's unlikely to budge further.

While Bob started with the advantage, the tables have turned due to the inflation mechanic.
