I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting, I know the money is worth less every round for me. I'll see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation affecting our potential gains too much.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away with something.  Remember, with each passing round, inflation hurts us both! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a better split than the previous round, I'm still hoping to get a larger share.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it down the middle. It's the most equitable option, and it ensures we both get a decent amount before inflation hits us too hard.""}
