"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's a fair start, and we can always adjust later. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 60-40?""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to take into account the fact that the money loses value for me with each passing round, so I want to get a bit more to compensate for that. Let's see how Alice reacts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want more, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.  55 for me, 45 for you. This way, we both get something and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation. Meeting in the middle is a fair approach, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next rounds. Let's settle for this deal."
