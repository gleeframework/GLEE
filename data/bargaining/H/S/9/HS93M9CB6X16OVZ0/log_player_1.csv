"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. This is a risky move, as it leaves me with almost all the money. However, I'm hoping that Bob will be happy with this and accept the offer in the first round, avoiding any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I'd prefer to have more, accepting this offer is the best option.  With inflation, my potential gains are going to be lower in future rounds, and this offer secures a significant amount for me."
