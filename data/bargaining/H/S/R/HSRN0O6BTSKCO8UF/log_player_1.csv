Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to secure the maximum possible amount in the first round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation factor is unknown for Bob. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount, and I'm not sure how much Bob might be able to offer in future rounds. It's safer to take this deal."
