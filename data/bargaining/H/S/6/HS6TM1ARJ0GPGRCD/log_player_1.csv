  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```

I don't think I should accept an offer that gives me 40% of the total, especially since I'm the one who made the first offer and tried to be fair. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."
