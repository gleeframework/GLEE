I'm going to propose a split that's heavily in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less to me in the next round.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds. The inflation is a serious factor, and this offer guarantees me something."
