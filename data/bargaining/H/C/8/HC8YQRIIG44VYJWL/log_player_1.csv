"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000, and I'll take $800,000. It's a good starting point, and I think we can both agree on this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are already getting smaller. I'll think carefully about this offer. After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000, and I'll take $550,000. It's a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his original offer. I'll think about it... Considering the further decrease in value, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
