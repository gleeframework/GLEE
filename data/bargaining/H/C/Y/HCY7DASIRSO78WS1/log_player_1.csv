"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount considering the risk of inflation. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly more aggressive stance this time, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to kick in!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's hope I didn't make a mistake!"
