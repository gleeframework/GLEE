# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $50 is worth 5% less than the initial $100, which is $47.50.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. A 50-50 split seems fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, and I rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

  ""message"": ""You said 50-50, but I think I deserve more. I'll give you 40, and take 60.""
