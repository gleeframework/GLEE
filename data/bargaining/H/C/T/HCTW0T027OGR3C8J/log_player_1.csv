"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, the effective values are:
- Alice gain: $400,000 (original value)
- Bob gain: $600,000 (original value)

I think this is a good offer for me, so I'll accept it.
