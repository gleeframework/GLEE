"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000
