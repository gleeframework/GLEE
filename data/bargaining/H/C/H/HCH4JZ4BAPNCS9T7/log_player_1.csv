"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting my slightly higher effort in proposing this game. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I feel that his message is a bit condescending and doesn't acknowledge my initial proposal. I'd like to make a counteroffer that reflects my initial proposal, but with some adjustments to account for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but not that much. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45""}

I'm adjusting my initial proposal to account for the inflation, and offering Bob a slightly smaller share. I'm hoping that this compromise will be more acceptable to him."
