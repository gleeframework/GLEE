"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering a slightly uneven split in my favor. The message is an attempt to frame this as a ""fair"" offer, even though it's not perfectly even, in the hopes that Bob might accept it early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We can still get a good deal with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, Bob's $50 is actually worth less than the face value, but my $50 is still worth the full amount. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a division of $57 for myself and $43 for Bob. Given that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob each round, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to reflect this, while also trying to maximize my own gain. The message aims to justify this split as being more than fair, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's share."
