# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now.  While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, I believe I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""}

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and we need to reach an agreement soon. This offer is still favorable to me, but the ""final offer"" stance adds pressure on Alice. She'll be more likely to accept knowing this is her last chance for a guaranteed payout before inflation eats away further at her potential gains."
