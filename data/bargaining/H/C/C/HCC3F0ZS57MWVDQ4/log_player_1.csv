"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as the first mover I'm taking a large portion but leaving a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my offer, but with a 10% inflation factor. It's still better than getting nothing at the end of the game, but I'm hoping to do better. I'll reject and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share to 7000 and offering Bob 3000. I'm still hoping for a favorable split but willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is again trying to flip the script, but I'm not convinced. We've been going back and forth, and while his offer is a slight improvement for me from the last round,  it's still not a good deal considering the inflation.  I'll reject again and see if he'll come down further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a 50/50 split.  We're approaching the midpoint of the game, and the money is losing value quickly. I believe a 50/50 split is fair, and  I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason and accept."
