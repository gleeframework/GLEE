"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and hope to get a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
