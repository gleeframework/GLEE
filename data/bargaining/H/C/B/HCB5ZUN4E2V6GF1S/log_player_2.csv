Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're feeling the pinch, I'm not. Time to decide. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough spot. I'm rapidly losing ground due to inflation. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance I'll end up with even less in the next round, especially if Alice continues to play hardball."
