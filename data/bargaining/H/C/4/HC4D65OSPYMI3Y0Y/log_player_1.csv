Round 2

# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less after the first round, the actual amount I'd get from Bob's offer is 700000 * 0.95 = 665000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount. I'll reject it for now.
