Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice. How about a 50/50 split? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With a 5% decrease in value, the money is now worth $95.

I'm not sure about a 50/50 split, as I'd rather have a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make my next proposal.
