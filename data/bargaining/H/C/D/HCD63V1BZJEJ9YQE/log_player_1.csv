"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering we both get less money each round 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40$ is worth 32$ in the next round, and Bob's gain of 60$ is worth 57$ in the next round.

I don't think this offer is a good deal for me, as I would be getting a smaller share even after adjusting for inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim for a higher share now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm being more aggressive this time, asking for 80% of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We both lose money with each round, so a fair split is the best option 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, my gain of 50$ is worth only about 25.92$ in the next round, and Bob's gain of 50$ is worth about 42.86$ in the next round.

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of money, I think a 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
