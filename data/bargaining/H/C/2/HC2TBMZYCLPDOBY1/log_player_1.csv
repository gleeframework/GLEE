"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid losing value due to inflation in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn for a strong start. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me, I don't lose anything by waiting, but Bob will lose more value due to inflation. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Counteroffer, considering inflation""}\n\nI've reduced my initial offer slightly, but still giving myself the larger share, considering that Bob's potential gain is decreasing due to inflation. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer before his share decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, this is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's message tries to create a sense of urgency, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me, I don't feel the pressure of inflation, whereas Bob's share is decreasing significantly. I'll try to make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to take advantage of Bob's decreasing bargaining power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 620000, ""bob_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""Last chance before I take more""}\n\nI've increased my share again, taking advantage of Bob's weakening position due to inflation. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to take an even larger share in the next round, knowing that Bob's options are dwindling."
