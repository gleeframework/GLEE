"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the first shot""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 6000 dollars and Bob 4000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less now, I'll need to adjust my thinking. With the new values, I'd be getting 3000 dollars, which is worth 2400 dollars in the original amount (since it's 20% less). Bob would be getting 7000 dollars, which is worth 6650 dollars in the original amount (since it's 5% less).

Considering the new values, I think this offer is a bit more favorable to Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll try to meet you in the middle this time""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, giving me 4500 dollars and Bob 5500 dollars. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more balanced, but still gives me a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the money is really losing value quickly!

Considering the new values, I'd be getting 5000 dollars, which is worth 2060 dollars in the original amount (since it's 48.8% less). Bob would also be getting 5000 dollars, which is worth 4270 dollars in the original amount (since it's 14.26% less).

Since we're meeting in the middle, I think this offer is a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer and wrap up the game.
