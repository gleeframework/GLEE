"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd be getting $320,000 (80% of $400,000) if I accept Bob's offer.

I'd rather not accept this offer since I'd be getting less than I would have in the first round, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this round.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to make up for lost time, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. You're getting a better deal than you think! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly due to inflation!

If I accept Bob's offer, I'd be getting $96,000 (48.8% of $200,000), which is still a significant decrease from the original amount.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a ""better deal"" than I think, but I'm not sure I have a better alternative. I'll take it.
