I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than what I offered him in the first round, even with inflation factored in. I'm not going to accept this. I'll see what kind of offer I can make in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've adjusted my offer to account for the inflation. I'm offering Bob slightly more than he received in round 2, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my initial proposal, even with inflation considered.  I believe I can still get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm continuing to adjust my offer based on inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of accepting this offer before it becomes even less favorable for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's disappointing to not get the larger share I initially hoped for, this offer is a 50/50 split, which is significantly better than Bob's previous offers. Given the rate of inflation, I don't think I can expect to get a better deal. I'm accepting this offer and ending the game."
