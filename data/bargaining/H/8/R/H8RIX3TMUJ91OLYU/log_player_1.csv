"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have the smaller share this time, but it's a good one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value. Let's calculate the effective gain for me:

Alice gain: 4000 (nominal) × 0.95 (since it's worth 5% less) = 3800 (effective)

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 3800 gain yet, especially since Bob is proposing a larger share for himself. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```

I'm trying to make a stronger offer this time, with a slightly larger share for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not budging much! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Let's calculate the effective gain for me:

Alice gain: 3500 (nominal) × 0.8574 (since it's worth 14.26% less) = 3003.9 (effective)

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 3004 gain when I was hoping for a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really affecting the value of the money now. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to make a stronger offer, but I'm not budging too much. I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice. I'm not getting any younger! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Let's calculate the effective gain for me:

Alice gain: 3000 (nominal) × 0.7744 (since it's worth 22.62% less) = 2323.2 (effective)

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 2323 gain when I was hoping for a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further, but I know time is running out!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The clock is ticking!

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4900,
  ""bob_gain"": 5100,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a final push, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to make a strong final offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Will Bob accept or make a counteroffer?"
