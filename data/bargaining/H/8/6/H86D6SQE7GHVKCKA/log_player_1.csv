``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. While he's making minor adjustments, they are far from ""reasonable"" given how much Alice is losing with each round. It's better to push our luck and hope Bob understands the situation. Otherwise, even accepting in the next round might leave us with a significantly worse deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 45,
""bob_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be serious. We're both losing out by dragging this on. My offer is generous considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to signal firmness and a limit to concessions. We are moving closer to a 50/50 split which is increasingly becoming the fairer outcome as time passes.  A strong message combined with a final offer might push Bob to accept."
