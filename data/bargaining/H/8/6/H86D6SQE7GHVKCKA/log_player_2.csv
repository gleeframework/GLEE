"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly. I take 60 and you get 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering Alice loses value each round.
###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's speed this up; I'll take a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a bit more, but my offer is the most reasonable in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that Alice's gain is worth less each round and my gain remains constant, I can afford to wait for a better offer or try to negotiate further, as the value of the money does not decrease for me.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll try to negotiate for a better split, considering the decreasing value of money for Alice might prompt her to agree to a more favorable division for me to end the game sooner."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make another offer, further adjusting the split in my favor, given that the value of money for Alice decreases with each round, while mine remains constant. This could incentivize her to accept a slightly less favorable offer to avoid further devaluation.

###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the circumstances, this is a fair adjustment.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that Alice's gain is now worth significantly less than in the first round due to inflation, and my gain remains constant, I have a strong negotiating position. An even split is not as favorable to me as it sounds because I can potentially get more value out of the deal if I wait longer or propose a counteroffer that slightly favors me more than the current offer.\n\n###\n\nI'll proceed to the next round, aiming to capitalize on the decreasing value of money for Alice, hoping she'll accept a less favorable offer to end the game sooner and minimize her losses due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the significant decrease in value for Alice and the constant value for me, I'll propose an offer that is even more in my favor than before. The pressure of inflation on Alice's side should make her more inclined to accept a less favorable offer to avoid further losses.

###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Given the circumstances, this is a reasonable adjustment.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be serious. We're both losing out by dragging this on. My offer is generous considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, considering Alice's offer and the significant decrease in value she's facing due to inflation, her offer seems relatively generous and pragmatic. Continuing to negotiate could lead to further marginal gains, but there's also a risk of Alice deciding to drastically decrease her offer or refuse to continue, which would leave both of us with nothing. Given the current circumstances, accepting the offer of 55 for me and 45 for Alice seems like the most reasonable and secure choice to ensure a gain from this game."
