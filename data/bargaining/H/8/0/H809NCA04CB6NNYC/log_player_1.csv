"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this quickly and get our share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of 5000 is actually worth 90% of 5000, which is 4500.

I'm not sure I want to accept a 50/50 split, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to two rounds of inflation, my gain of 5500 would be worth 80% of 5500, which is 4400.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway.""
}
```"
