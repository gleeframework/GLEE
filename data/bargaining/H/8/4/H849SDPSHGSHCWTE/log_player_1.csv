"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount to test his willingness to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  We both get an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 45$.

I'm not sure if Bob is aware of the inflation, so I'll have to be cautious. Since he's offering an equal split, I'll reject this offer to see if he's willing to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 60$ would be worth 54$ (60 * 0.9), which is a good chunk of the remaining money. I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You were close, Bob. Let's try again.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair.  It's a little closer to my previous offer, and still gives you a good share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 29.2$ (40 / 1.271). I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is offering me a smaller share, I'll accept this offer to end the game.
