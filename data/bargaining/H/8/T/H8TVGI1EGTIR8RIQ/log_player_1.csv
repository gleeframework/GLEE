"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose taking 900,000 and giving Bob 100,000. I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent amount while still leaving me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share by 100,000, but I think this is still a fair deal. Bob's inflation rate is significant, so this offer will be much better for him than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a bad deal for me. Even though I'm not losing money due to inflation, the offer is still far below what I should be getting.  I'm hoping Bob will make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still confident this is a fair offer. Bob's inflation is increasing, and I'm confident he will recognize this deal is better for him than continuing to reject offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  His inflation rate is making his offers less and less appealing, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to play."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm dropping my share again, but I'm hoping Bob will finally recognize this is a good deal for him. His inflation is getting really bad, and I'm sure he's feeling the pressure to make a deal."
