Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 5800

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation, but his offer is still significantly worse than what I proposed in the previous round. The value is decreasing, but I'm not desperate enough yet to accept such an unfair deal. I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a reasonable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic. I need a larger share to account for inflation. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm sticking to my guns with the 60/40 split. By now, Bob should realize that I'm willing to let the rounds progress and the money depreciate if it means getting a fair deal. I'm conveying urgency with ""final offer"" while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
