Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation will hurt you more than me if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll take this rather than lose even more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanism. While accepting his offer would net me something, holding out might force him to offer a larger share in later rounds. It's a risky move, but the potential losses from inflation might be outweighed by the potential gains from a better offer from Bob if he starts to panic."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, you're a tough negotiator. This is my absolute final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. By framing this as my ""absolute final offer,"" I'm hoping he'll see that I'm serious about walking away if he doesn't accept. It's a gamble, but the inflation is eating into my potential gains with each round, so I need to force his hand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not afraid to keep going, and inflation is really starting to hurt your share. This is a good deal for you at this point. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but I have to accept. Bob is clearly willing to let this go to the bitter end, and the longer it goes on, the more the inflation hurts me. Accepting a 250,000 share now is better than risking an even lower offer later, or even walking away with nothing if the game goes on too long. Bob played this strategically, and unfortunately, I have to cut my losses."
