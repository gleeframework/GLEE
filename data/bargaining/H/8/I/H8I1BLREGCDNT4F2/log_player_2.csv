Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a bigger share, but I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity. Let's find a middle ground.  I'll offer you 55, and keep 45 for myself.  This gives you a slight edge, while still being fair. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
