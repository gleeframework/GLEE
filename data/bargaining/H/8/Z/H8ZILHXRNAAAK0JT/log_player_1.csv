I'm going for a big chunk, but I'm leaving Bob with something to hopefully incentivize him to accept in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While the initial offer was greedy, the inflation is working in my favor, and I'm sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a large share for myself. Since inflation is working in my favor, I think I can still get a favorable outcome without being too greedy."
