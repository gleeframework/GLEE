"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to receive $600,000, while Bob would receive $400,000. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is a brief description of my proposal, aiming to convey a sense of fairness and equality in the division. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round, the effective value of the $300,000 offered by Bob is actually $240,000. Considering this, I decide to reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that would give me a higher effective gain.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this offer, considering the impact of inflation, I'm effectively offering to take $560,000 (since 20% less in the second round and another 20% less in this round would be 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, but this applies to what I gain, which is not the case here, I made a mistake, 700,000 is 700,000 for Bob but for me is actually 700,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 448,000), while Bob would receive $300,000. The message ""Let's try to meet in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to a sense of compromise and fairness, acknowledging the previous offers and aiming to find a mutually acceptable solution. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer Alice.  Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money I gain, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I decide to accept Bob's offer. The effective value of the $400,000 offered by Bob, after accounting for the inflation, would be approximately $205,120 (400,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 204,800,  I made another mistake, it's actually 400,000 * 0.512 = 204,800). Given the decreasing value of the money and Bob's message indicating this is his final offer, I believe accepting this deal is the best option to secure a gain, despite the reduced value."
