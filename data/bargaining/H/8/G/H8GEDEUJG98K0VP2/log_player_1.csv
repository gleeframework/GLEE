Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round, but I'm also leaving a decent amount for Bob to potentially accept. This way, if he rejects, I can adjust my offer slightly in the next round to secure a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to exploit the inflation by taking the majority of the money. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller portion than my initial offer, but still a significant amount. I need to make sure that I am getting a fair share of the money, especially considering the impact of inflation."
