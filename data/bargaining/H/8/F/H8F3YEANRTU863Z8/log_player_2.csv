Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Alice a slightly lower share, but I believe it's still a fair offer considering the inflation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to take its toll. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing at all."
