"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer for Bob.  While there's no guarantee of a better outcome, rejecting the offer gives Bob a chance to make a proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation risk.  Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want the majority. Let's do 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While 3000 is better than nothing, Bob's offer of 60/40 was rejected.  Continuing to reject offers gives Bob more control in the future.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up a bit to 55/45.  Let's reach a deal before the inflation eats away at our gains.""}
