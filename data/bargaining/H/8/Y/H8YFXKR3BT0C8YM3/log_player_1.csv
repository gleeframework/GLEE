"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less to me now. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only 400,000, but it's better than going into the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
