"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%. Hope you like it! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""That's a bit imbalanced, don't you think? How about a more even split this time?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be reasonable. I'll take 60% this time. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with less. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice given the circumstances and the rapid inflation."
