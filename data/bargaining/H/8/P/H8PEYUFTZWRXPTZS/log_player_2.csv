"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair-ish offer. I'm taking the majority, but you get a decent share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not satisfied with only 10 dollars. I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Besides, 10 dollars is not a ""decent share"" of 100 dollars. Let's see what I can propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try to be more fair. I think 60-40 is a reasonable split.""}\n\n###\nNow it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept my offer or not."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to 55, but I think we both need to be more flexible to get anything. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI still think I can get a better deal, and 45 is not the middle ground I was hoping for. Since the money is worth less now due to inflation, I need to consider that in my next proposal. Let's see what I can offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think we both need to compromise. I'm willing to take 57, which is a bit closer to the middle ground.""}\n\n###\nNow it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept my offer or not. I took into account the inflation and tried to find a balance between our previous proposals."
