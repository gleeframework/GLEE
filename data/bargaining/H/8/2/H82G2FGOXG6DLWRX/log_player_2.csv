Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite skewed. Let's be reasonable. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This accounts for the inflation we both face.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with a 70/30 split.  Let's compromise. I'll take 40%, and you can have 60%. This is still a good deal for you, considering the inflation we're both experiencing. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40
