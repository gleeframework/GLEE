"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90% of the money this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're open to it. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
