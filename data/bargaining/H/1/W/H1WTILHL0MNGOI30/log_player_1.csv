"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking its toll, my gain is worth even less now. I'll consider Bob's offer. Since it's a 60-40 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is still affecting my gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss of value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering a larger share, but I hope it'll be more attractive to Bob this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With my money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is a relatively fair split considering the circumstances. I'll have to accept it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
