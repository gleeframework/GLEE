"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll think carefully... Since Bob is offering a slightly smaller share than last round, I'm not sure if I should accept. But considering the inflation, I'd rather get something now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
