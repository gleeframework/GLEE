"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we split the money fairly, but with a slight bias towards me getting the majority."
