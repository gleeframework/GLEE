"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk.  Accept and we're both happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept a quick deal, I'm Bob and I'm playing to maximize my share.  100,000 is a decent start, but I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair starting point, and avoids the risk of losing money with each passing round.""}
