"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer is designed to be very appealing to Bob, as he gets a small but non-zero amount.  I'm aiming for a quick resolution, but also want to secure a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation means my share would keep decreasing with each round, and Bob's offer is a significant improvement on what I'd get if I rejected and waited for the next round."
