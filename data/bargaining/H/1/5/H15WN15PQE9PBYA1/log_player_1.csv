Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the previous offers, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and then made a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll aim for a 55-45 split.

Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
