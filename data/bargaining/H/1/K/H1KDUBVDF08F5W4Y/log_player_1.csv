"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you can take 20. We can end it here if you like.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not interested in giving you 80. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than the previous round. In the first round, my gain was $80, which is now worth 90% of that, which is $72.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll get $50, which is worth 10% less than my initial gain in the first round. However, it's a higher percentage of the current total than my initial offer, and it's a more even split than my initial offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
