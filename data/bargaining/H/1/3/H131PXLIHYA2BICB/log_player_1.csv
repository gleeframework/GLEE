"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle quickly due to inflation."" 
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** This offer gives Alice a significant advantage, but it's not outrageously unfair. It sets a tone that Alice is serious about getting a larger share.
* **Inflation Factor:** Highlighting the inflation difference is crucial. It subtly reminds Bob that time is against Alice more than him, putting pressure on him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is firm but not aggressive.  It leaves room for Bob to counter-offer without feeling completely lowballed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer undervalues my position given the inflation disparity. Let's find a fairer middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation disparity, his proposed split heavily favors him. Accepting this deal would leave Alice with significantly less than she could potentially secure. It's better to counter-propose and demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, but not at the cost of a severely disadvantageous outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but we need a solution that works for both of us. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the time pressure from inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer moves closer to the middle ground, reflecting a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time Pressure:** It subtly reiterates the inflation issue, reminding Bob that prolonging the game hurts Alice more than him.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message maintains firmness regarding Alice's desired outcome while still proposing a deal that could be perceived as reasonable by Bob."
