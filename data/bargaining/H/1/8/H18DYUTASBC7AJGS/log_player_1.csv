This is a tough situation, but I have to accept.  While the split isn't ideal, if I reject this offer, the inflation will eat away even more of my potential gains. It's likely Bob won't offer more favorable terms in the remaining rounds. Accepting ensures I get something rather than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
