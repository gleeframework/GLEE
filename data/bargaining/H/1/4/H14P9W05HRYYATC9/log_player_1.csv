"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I need to consider the adjusted amounts.

For me, the offer is 5000 dollars, which is 50% of the current value (10000 * 0.8 * 0.9 = 7200, and 7200 * 0.6944 = 5000).
For Bob, the offer is 5000 dollars, which is 50% of the current value (10000 * 0.9 = 9000, and 9000 * 0.5556 = 5000).

I accept this offer.
