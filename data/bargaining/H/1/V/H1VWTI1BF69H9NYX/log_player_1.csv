"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20. You get a smaller share, but we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, this way we can end the game quickly and avoid any potential losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is tempting, but I think I can do better. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to negotiate for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too even, I'd like to try to get a bit more. Can you offer me a slightly higher share?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob now, I'll try to take advantage of that. I'll offer him a smaller share, but still a decent one, to try to end the game quickly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're losing ground with each round, let's split it 60/40. It's still a good deal for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 45/55. This way we both get a good share and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less for Bob now, so I'll try to take advantage of that. However, Bob's offer is a good one, and I don't want to risk him making an even lower offer later. I'll accept his proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 45/55 it is. Let's end the game and get our shares.""
}
```"
