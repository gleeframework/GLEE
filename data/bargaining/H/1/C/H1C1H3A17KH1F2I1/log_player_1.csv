"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000 and take $6000 for myself.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm leaving room for negotiations. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```

I'll hold out for a better deal, considering the reduced value of my potential gain."

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the inflation.""
