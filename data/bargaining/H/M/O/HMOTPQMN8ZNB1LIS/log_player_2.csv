It's a bit too early to accept an offer that gives me only 30%. I want to see if I can get a better deal later on."

# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit on the value too.  Meet me in the middle and let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. While Alice's offer is closer than before, I'm not willing to settle for less than a 50/50 split, especially with the value decreasing so rapidly."

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's just split it evenly and be done with this.""}
