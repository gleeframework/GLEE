I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about whether this is a good deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 40/60, I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a bigger share""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 27.1% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Since Bob is offering a bigger share, I'll think about whether it's a good deal.

After some thought, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. The 58/42 split is better than my previous offers, and I don't want to risk going back to the negotiation table.
