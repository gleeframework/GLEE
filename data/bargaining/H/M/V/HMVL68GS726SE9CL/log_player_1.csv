"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm looking for a better deal. Can we do better than that? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer.

After considering Bob's message and the new values, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous to Bob. I'd like to see a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, as I think I deserve a fairer share. Let's see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which I think is a more balanced and reasonable offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I need a better deal to retire in style. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious with my decisions. However, I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially with Bob's message implying he's trying to strong-arm me.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Sorry, Bob, but I'm not willing to give you the upper hand. I'd like to see a more even split.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob's ""retirement plans"" are a valid reason for a more skewed split. Let's see what he comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about my next move. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, Bob. 50-50 seems like a fair way to split the remaining funds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
