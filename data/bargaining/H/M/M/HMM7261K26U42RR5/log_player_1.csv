"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. No need to negotiate, let's just get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I think 4000 is still too low for me, considering the reduced value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the 40% reduction in value due to inflation (20% in the first round and 20% in the second round), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time, Bob. I'm taking what I think I deserve!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% reduction in value, I need to be even more careful with my decision. Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
