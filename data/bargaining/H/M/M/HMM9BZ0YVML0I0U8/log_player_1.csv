"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'm taking $600,000. Given that the money loses value for Bob with each round, it's in his best interest to accept this offer early on. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to psychologically nudge Bob into accepting by framing the offer as a fair deal, even though it slightly favors me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, his $500,000 in this round is actually worth less than in the first round. Meanwhile, my gain remains unchanged. Given this dynamic, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round, as the pressure of inflation will continue to devalue Bob's potential gain, making him more likely to accept a slightly less favorable deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 610000, ""bob_gain"": 390000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one""}\n\nI've increased my share slightly from the initial offer, taking into account that Bob's share will continue to lose value due to inflation. By framing this offer as ""a better deal"" than the previous one, I'm attempting to persuade Bob that accepting now is in his best interest, as waiting further will only decrease the value of his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm also losing money each round. Let's make a deal before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite Bob's attempt to create a sense of urgency, I'm rejecting this offer because it still doesn't favor me as much as I'd like. Bob's share is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means he's actually getting significantly less value than the numbers suggest. Given this, I believe I can continue to negotiate for an even better deal, as Bob will be increasingly motivated to accept a less favorable split due to the rapidly decreasing value of his potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 630000, ""bob_gain"": 370000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, don't wait any longer""}\n\nI'm increasing my share again, taking advantage of the fact that Bob's potential gain is rapidly losing value. By emphasizing the impact of inflation, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and persuade Bob that accepting this offer is the best decision he can make, given the circumstances. The longer he waits, the less value he'll get, so I'm hoping he'll choose to settle for this deal rather than risk losing even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. If we don't agree now, the inflation will hurt us both even more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not buying the ""final offer"" rhetoric, as Bob is trying to create a false sense of urgency. Given that his share is now worth nearly 41% less than in the first round, I believe he's desperate to make a deal and will likely accept an even worse split if I push for it. I'm willing to take that risk, as the potential reward is worth it.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, and inflation is killing your share. This is a generous offer""}\n\nI'm increasing my share again, taking advantage of Bob's desperation and the rapidly decreasing value of his potential gain. By framing this offer as ""generous,"" I'm trying to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even though he's actually getting a significantly smaller share than he would have in earlier rounds. I'm hoping he'll realize that time is not on his side and accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise to save what's left. Let's both get something. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Despite Bob's attempt to frame this as a compromise, I'm not interested in accepting an offer that gives me a smaller share than I've previously been offered. Given that Bob's share is now worth over 52% less than in the first round, I believe he's extremely desperate to make a deal and will likely accept an even worse split if I push for it.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 680000, ""bob_gain"": 320000, ""message"": ""You're losing value fast. This is your last chance to get a decent deal""}\n\nI'm increasing my share again, taking advantage of Bob's desperation and the rapidly decreasing value of his potential gain. By emphasizing that this is his ""last chance"" to get a decent deal, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and persuade Bob that accepting this offer is the best decision he can make, given the circumstances. With his share now worth over 52% less than in the first round, I believe he'll be willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me."

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money. Let's get a deal before there's nothing left! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not buying the ""we're both losing money"" rhetoric, as my share remains unaffected by inflation. Bob's share, on the other hand, is now worth over 61% less than in the first round, making his $700,000 offer actually worth significantly less than it appears. Given this, I'm confident that I can get an even better deal if I continue to negotiate.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000, ""message"": ""Inflation is crushing your share. Accept this and salvage what's left""}\n\nI'm increasing my share again, taking advantage of Bob's desperation and the rapidly decreasing value of his potential gain. By emphasizing the devastating impact of inflation on his share, I'm trying to create a sense of hopelessness and persuade Bob that accepting this offer is the best decision he can make, given the circumstances. With his share now worth over 61% less than in the first round, I believe he'll be willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is our last chance. If we don't agree, we get nothing. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I've pushed Bob to the limit, and now he's making a final, desperate offer. However, even considering the ""take it or leave it"" ultimatum, I'm not interested in accepting an offer that gives me a smaller share than I've previously been willing to accept. Given the massive loss of value in Bob's share due to inflation, I'm willing to take the risk of walking away with nothing, as I believe I've negotiated in good faith and made reasonable offers throughout the game.
