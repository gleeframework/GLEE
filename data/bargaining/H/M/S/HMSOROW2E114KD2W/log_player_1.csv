"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as it's a good deal for him given the inflation risk. But if he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is more equitable, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident that I can get a better share in the next round. The inflation affects Bob more than me, so I'll try to leverage that in my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly from the initial offer, but still offering a significant amount to Bob.  The inflation should be working in my favor now, as it affects Bob's gains more significantly. I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough for him to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer isn't ideal, the inflation is becoming a serious factor. Given that the money I gain will be worth less than half of what it was in the first round, it's  more prudent to accept this offer and secure a decent amount.  The risk of further negotiation is too high."
