Let's see if Bob likes a 90/10 split. I think it's a fair starting point, considering he gets a larger cut later on due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better deal for me than the last round, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob. It's worth taking the 50/50 split now."
