"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'll still give you a decent amount. You can't expect everything! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great deal for me! I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I was hoping for a more generous share, considering the money is still worth 100% of its original value for me, but only 95% for Bob. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. 42% for me, 58% for you. Let's settle""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a fair deal. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
