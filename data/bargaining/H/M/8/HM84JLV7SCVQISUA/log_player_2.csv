{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a better deal. While this offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's not enough to compensate for the inflation I'm experiencing.  I'll continue to try and negotiate a more favorable outcome."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I understand the urgency and Alice's tactic, but the offer still doesn't make up for the massive inflation I'm facing. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a better compromise or risk losing everything."

The inflation is hitting me hard, and with only one round left, I need to make a decisive move. While this offer seems tempting, I still need to try and get more to offset the significant loss from inflation."
