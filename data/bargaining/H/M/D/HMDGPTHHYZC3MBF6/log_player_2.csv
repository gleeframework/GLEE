Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is literally money here, and it's disappearing faster for me.  My new offer is 55/45. It's better for you than my last offer after factoring in inflation, and it avoids us dragging this out any further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
