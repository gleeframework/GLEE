"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100 and leaving 40% for Bob. This seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for Bob, he's making a more aggressive offer. However, since the money is worth the same for me, I'm not motivated to accept a 50/50 split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With Bob's previous offer being 50/50, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share. Since the money is worth the same for me, I'll try to take a bigger chunk.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less for Bob, his offer is actually a relatively small increase from the 50/50 split in round 2. Considering the money is still worth the same for me, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
