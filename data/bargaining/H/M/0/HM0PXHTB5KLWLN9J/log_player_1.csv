"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to start by offering a very generous 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this will be a good starting point and encourage Bob to accept.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a significant shift in the division, and it's not worth it for me to accept. The inflation is hitting me hard, and while Bob's gains are also reduced, it's not by as much. I'll reject and try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm going to try to compromise a bit. I'll offer a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm still trying to secure a decent amount considering the inflation.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
