"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more, let's see what you say! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Considering the offer, I'll have to take 400,000, which is worth 80% of the original 500,000 I could have had in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob is proposing to take 600,000, which is worth 120% of the original 500,000 he could have had in the first round.

I'm not sure I like this deal. I'd rather not give up 20% of the original value to Bob.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 64% of the original value due to two rounds of inflation (20% * 20% = 40% reduction, and then another 20% reduction). I'll need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32/68 split, which should be more favorable to Bob than the previous offers. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still in the lead! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 51.2% of the original value due to four rounds of inflation (20% * 20% * 20% * 20% = 64% reduction, and then another 20% reduction). I'll need to adjust my calculation.

Considering the offer, I'll have to take 300,000, which is worth 60% of the original 500,000 I could have had in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob is proposing to take 700,000, which is worth 140% of the original 500,000 he could have had in the first round.

This deal still doesn't feel right to me. I'm not willing to give up 40% of the original value to Bob.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 41.184% of the original value due to five rounds of inflation (20% * 20% * 20% * 20% * 20% = 76.8% reduction, and then another 20% reduction, and then another 20% reduction, and then another 20% reduction, and then another 20% reduction, and then another 20% reduction). I'll need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 770000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up much more, you're going to have to make a better offer if you want this to end!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 23/77 split, which should be a more aggressive offer considering the reduced value of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me much, so I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 32.77% of the original value due to six rounds of inflation (20% * 20% * 20% * 20% * 20% * 20% = 92.16% reduction, and then another 20% reduction, and then another 20% reduction, and then another 20% reduction, and then another 20% reduction, and then another 20% reduction). I'll need to adjust my calculation.

Considering the offer, I'll have to take 150,000, which is worth 30% of the original 500,000 I could have had in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob is proposing to take 850,000, which is worth 170% of the original 500,000 he could have had in the first round.

This deal is getting even worse for me. I'm not willing to give up 70% of the original value to Bob.

I'm proposing a 10/90 split, which is my last resort. I'm not sure if Bob will accept this offer, but I'm hoping he'll finally agree to end the game."
