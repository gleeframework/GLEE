"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm starting with a large share for myself, knowing that the money will lose value in each round.  However, I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to incentivize him to accept the offer rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation factor makes this offer increasingly attractive.  It's a fair split, and I risk getting nothing if I reject and Bob changes his mind in the next round."
