# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller increase, but I still think I deserve the larger share 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is slowly coming down in her demands.  While she's taking a smaller increase, she's still heavily favoring herself.  I'm betting I can push her below 5500 in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4400, ""alice_gain"": 5600, ""message"": ""Let's settle this now. This offer is a good deal considering the time pressure and the inflation working against you.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm nudging my offer up slightly, but still keeping it below her previous offer of 5700. This signals a willingness to compromise but keeps the pressure on Alice. The message reinforces the urgency of the situation and the negative impact of inflation on her potential gains."
