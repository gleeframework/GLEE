Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your last offer, 57% for me is the lowest I'll go 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, time is running out.  I need to show firmness to encourage her to make a more substantial concession in the next round. Accepting 43% now might make her think I'm willing to settle for even less."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  I am giving you a slight majority, but we need to close this deal soon. We both lose if we don't agree.""

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than half. 56% for me is the best I can do 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

We are now past the halfway point, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, even if it's slowly. Accepting 44% now guarantees a reasonable payout. Holding out for a better deal in the remaining rounds is risky, as Alice might become less generous and we could end up with nothing."
