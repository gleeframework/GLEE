"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. I'm willing to share the wealth, but I'm also hoping for a good return on my investment. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a chance for you to secure a sizable sum while it still holds significant value. My turn to propose next will only diminish your potential gains.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but this is a more balanced split considering the inflation we are both experiencing. If we can't find a compromise, we risk losing a significant amount of money. Let's aim for a fair outcome. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it still heavily favors her, especially considering the rapid inflation working against her.  I need to push for a more equitable outcome in the next round."
