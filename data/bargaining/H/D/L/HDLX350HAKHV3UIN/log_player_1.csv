"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still considering the same amount of value.

In this round, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should be more aggressive in my next offer.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to be a bit more aggressive in my next offer. I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more for myself.""
}
```

This offer is a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 50-50 is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is now worth less to him, so I should be more cautious about accepting. However, the 50-50 split is still a relatively fair offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

Considering the value of the money I gain is still the same as in the first round, I'll accept this offer.
