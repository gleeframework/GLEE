"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous. Take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to frame her offer as generous due to inflation, it's important to remember that the decrease in value only affects her. My potential gains remain the same. Holding out for a better offer is still the best strategy."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer.""}"
