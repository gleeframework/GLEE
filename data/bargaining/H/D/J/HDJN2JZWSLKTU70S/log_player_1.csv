"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer. This gives us both a good chunk of the money.""

This offer aims to be enticing to Bob while still securing a good portion of the money for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This feels more balanced considering the inflation. I'm willing to meet in the middle.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value quickly for Alice. It's crucial to secure a decent amount sooner rather than later.
* **Compromise:** Bob's offer was too far in his favor. This counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing Alice's needs. 
* **Urgency:** The message subtly reminds Bob that time is of the essence with the phrase ""feels more balanced *considering the inflation*."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploitation:** Bob is clearly trying to leverage the inflation difference to his advantage. While it's true Alice is affected more, his offer is disproportionately skewed in his favor.
* **Potential Losses:** Accepting this offer means Alice loses a significant portion of the initial value. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a fairer deal.
* **Holding Ground:**  Continuously giving in to unfavorable offers will only encourage Bob to push for even more. By rejecting this, Alice signals she's not willing to accept just any deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  It's crucial we settle this now before the inflation eats away any further value.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** The message clearly communicates to Bob that Alice is serious and this is her last offer.
* **Slight Concession:** Alice has slightly lowered her demand from 5500 to 5200, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm boundary.
* **Urgency and Logic:** Emphasizing the detrimental effect of inflation on both parties adds weight to the need for a quick resolution. This encourages Bob to accept rather than risk another round with even less value.

**Overall Strategy:**

Alice is walking a fine line between firmness and flexibility. By progressively lowering her demand while remaining firm about not accepting unfair offers, she's aiming to reach an agreement that, while not ideal, prevents further losses due to the punishing inflation rate."
