"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less to me in this round, Bob's offer of $450,000 is actually equivalent to $405,000 in the first round. Meanwhile, the amount Bob would get is worth 20% less, so the $550,000 Bob would get is actually equivalent to $440,000 in the first round. Considering this, I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $420,000 and keep $580,000 for myself. Considering the inflation, this offer is actually more generous than my initial offer, as the $420,000 Bob would get is equivalent to $336,000 in the first round, while the $580,000 I would get is equivalent to $522,000 in the first round. I'll include a message saying ""Let's split the difference"" to try to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable compromise.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference""}\n\nLet me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split, given the continued inflation.  Let's try to be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 27.1% less to me in this round, Bob's offer of $420,000 is actually equivalent to $306,000 in the first round. Meanwhile, the amount Bob would get is worth 48.8% less, so the $580,000 Bob would get is actually equivalent to $298,000 in the first round. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think this offer is reasonable, and it's better to accept it rather than risking further devaluation in the next round.
