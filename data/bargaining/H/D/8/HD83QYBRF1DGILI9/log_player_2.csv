Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob! I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle... sort of. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation... Let's get serious, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, which is working in my favor. While this offer is slightly better than her previous one, I believe I can push for an even better deal as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alright Alice, let's be practical. I'm offering you a little more than you offered me last round. It's a good deal considering the circumstances.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm nudging the offer slightly in my favor again, taking advantage of the pressure on Alice. It's a small enough change that she might accept to avoid further losses from inflation, but still beneficial for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really hurting me now... Can't we just meet in the middle already?! 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is clearly feeling the heat, I'm still in a strong position. We're past the halfway point, and she's getting increasingly desperate.  I believe I can push for at least a 48/52 split in my favor before she panics and accepts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm offering a slight edge, but this is as high as I'm willing to go.  Let's end this.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying more pressure by increasing the urgency in my message.  Offering 51/49 is a calculated risk. It's a small win for me, but with the time constraint and inflation working against her, Alice might see it as the best she can get at this point."
