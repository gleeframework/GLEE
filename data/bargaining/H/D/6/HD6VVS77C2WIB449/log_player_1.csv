"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I think I deserve a little more since I get to make the first proposal.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's proposal is fair, especially since he gets to make the first proposal. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and being a bit more generous to Bob, while still keeping a slight edge for myself."
