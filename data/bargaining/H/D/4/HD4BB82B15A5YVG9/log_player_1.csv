Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n### \n\nI made an offer of 60-40 in my favor, with a message suggesting that I'm being generous by not taking more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time. I'm willing to take slightly less, but I think it's important we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I'd rather try to get a better deal in the next round than accept 45 dollars that are worth 20% less than in the first round.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I will make a new offer for round 3.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm being generous again, considering the inflation""}\n\nI made an offer of 58-42 in my favor, with a message suggesting that I'm being generous again, taking into account the inflation that affects my gain.
