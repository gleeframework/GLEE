"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and see where we go from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an even split, but I'm trying to take a bit more now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to propose a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to propose a slightly better deal for myself this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take more, but I'm not giving up that much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than the 40/60 split, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still holding out, I'll take a bit more now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a bigger share, and I need to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the significant inflation, I'll have to be cautious.

However, I still want to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to propose a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! I'll have to be even more careful with my proposal this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to take care of myself too. This is my last offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm also leaving some room for Bob to accept this offer and end the game."
