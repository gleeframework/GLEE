Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 10% less, so I'd be getting $490,000 in ""real"" value, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'd be getting $570,000 in ""real"" value.

I'll reject this offer.
