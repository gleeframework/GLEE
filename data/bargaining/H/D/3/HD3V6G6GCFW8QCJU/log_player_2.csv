"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, considering your role in this game is more challenging than mine. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the current value of the money is still $1,000,000, and if we proceed to the next round, the value will decrease by 5% for me and 10% for Alice, correct?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to propose a division that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us, and also considering that Alice initially proposed a significantly uneven split, suggesting her flexibility in negotiations.\n\n###\n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the value decrease and your initial flexibility, let's aim for a more balanced split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm again, after this round, if we proceed further, the value of money will decrease by another 5% for me and 10% for Alice, correct?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly this time.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation and both of us have been flexible. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting Alice's offer because, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, an even split at this point seems reasonable and fair. The fact that both of us have shown flexibility in our proposals indicates a willingness to compromise, and accepting this offer seems like the best course of action given the current state of the game.\n\n###\n\nIt's also worth noting that, due to the inflation rates, the actual value of what we're gaining is less than it appears, but the 50/50 split principle is what I'm agreeing to here.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if this concludes the game as per the rules.\n\n###"
