"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to consider that in my decision. If I accept this offer, I'll get $7,000, which is 70% of the original $10,000. That's a good chunk of money, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
