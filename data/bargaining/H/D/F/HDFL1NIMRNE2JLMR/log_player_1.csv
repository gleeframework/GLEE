Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. This split ensures a more equitable outcome. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer was for Bob! I need to incentivize him to negotiate but also be mindful of the dwindling value.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation erodes the value further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting dangerously close to the wire, and Bob knows it. While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split now might be better than risking getting a much worse offer later when the inflation has eaten away more of my potential gains.
