"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I'm offering Bob 60% of the money and keeping 40% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'm essentially getting 95% of $2000, which is $1900. Meanwhile, Bob is getting $8000, which is the same as in the first round.

Considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I think I should aim for a higher amount to make up for the loss. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 5% decrease in the value of the money for me, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate for the loss. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I'd get in this offer. Initially, $2500 would be worth $2500. However, due to the 14.26% decrease in value, it's now worth $2500 * 0.8582 = $2145.50. Meanwhile, Bob gets $7500, which is still worth $7500.

Considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I think I should aim for a higher amount to make up for the loss. This offer is still relatively low for me, so I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 14.26% decrease in the value of the money for me, I'll aim for an even higher percentage to compensate for the loss. Here's my new proposal:

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I'd get in this offer. Initially, $1500 would be worth $1500. However, due to the 22.62% decrease in value, it's now worth $1500 * 0.7778 = $1167. The money Bob gets, $8500, is still worth $8500.

Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I'd get in this offer. Initially, $1000 would be worth $1000. However, due to the 30.17% decrease in value, it's now worth $1000 * 0.6923 = $692.30. Meanwhile, Bob gets $9000, which is still worth $9000.

# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I'd get in this offer. Initially, $500 would be worth $500. However, due to the 36.98% decrease in value, it's now worth $500 * 0.6364 = $318.20. Meanwhile, Bob gets $9500, which is still worth $9500.

Round 12

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's my last chance to make a deal. If I reject this offer, we'll both end up with nothing. Considering the 43.12% decrease in the value of the money for me, I'd get $0 * 0.5668 = $0 if I were to get nothing. At least with this offer, I'd get $0, but Bob would get $10,000.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I'll get at least something out of the deal.
