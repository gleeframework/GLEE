"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair starting point.  Let's see if we can find a more mutually beneficial solution in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round, as the money will be worth less to her than it is to me right now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe a more equitable split is necessary. This offer reflects a greater balance and sets the stage for future collaboration.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to be satisfied.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer ensures I get a substantial amount, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing with each round.  It's a compromise, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
