"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly between us, with each of us getting $50. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward proposal and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent share too. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority, but is willing to give me a decent share. Considering the inflation, I'd rather get 40 now than risk waiting for a better offer and potentially getting less in future rounds. I'll accept this offer.
