"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split this 90/10, but you'll have to hurry! The longer we wait, the less valuable our money becomes. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While a $100,000 gain is nice, I'm not sure about this 90/10 split. It's a huge difference, and I'm sure I can get a better deal. I'll see what Alice offers next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but we need to act quickly.  This inflation is biting into our profits.  Let's split it 60/40, and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is better than her previous one, but I still believe I can get a more equitable split.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is a concern, but I'm not willing to settle for less than 50% yet."

Round 4
