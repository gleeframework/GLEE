"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the 5% decrease in the value of my gain, I'll have $475,000 (95% of $500,000) if I accept this offer. Meanwhile, Bob will have $600,000, which is worth 90% of his proposed gain of $666,667 (10% less than $750,000).

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is losing value rapidly. If I accept this offer, I'll have $450,000, which is worth 90.5% of my original share of $500,000 (95% of 95% of $500,000). Meanwhile, Bob will have $550,000, which is worth 82.6% of his original share of $666,667 (10% less than $750,000).

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll decide to accept this offer.
