"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 5 for me and 95 for her, I'll try to counter with a similar split, but slightly more in my favor. I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 52.5, ""alice_gain"": 47.5}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 9.75% less due to inflation, and Alice's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer. The 50% gain is equivalent to $50, which is actually 45.25 in the original value, so it's a decent deal considering the inflation.
