"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets $20. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better share. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my initial $80 is now worth $76.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled with the idea of giving up more than I already did in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer to see how Bob responds.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

This offer gives me 85% of the (now slightly less valuable) $100, which is $85, and Bob gets $15."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more than that. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 14.26% decrease in value due to inflation, my initial $80 is now worth $68.52.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled with the idea of giving up more than I already did in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is closer to the initial 50/50 split, which seems reasonable. I'll consider accepting this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
