Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a very small share (10%) and keep the majority (90%) for myself.  Since the money is worth less each round, I want to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My share is worth 20% less than in the first round.  If I reject, I have to wait another round, and my share will be worth even less. 
* **Bob's Power:** Bob has the advantage now. If I reject, he gets to make the next offer, and I have no guarantee he'll give me anything at all.
* **Fairness:** While 40 is less than I wanted, it's still a reasonable share, considering the inflation. 

It's better to take what I can get now and avoid risking losing everything."
