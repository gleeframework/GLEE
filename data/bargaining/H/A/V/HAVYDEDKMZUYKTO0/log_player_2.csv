"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is extremely lopsided, and while it's tempting to take something, it's worth risking a few rounds to try and get a more even split. Remember, the money depreciates with each round, but it's still better to get a more fair share, even if it takes longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair 50/50 split. It's a good starting point and hopefully, Alice sees the value in a fair division."
