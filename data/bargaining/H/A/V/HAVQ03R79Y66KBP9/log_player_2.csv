I'm still hoping for a better deal, even with the inflation hitting hard. I'm not going to settle for less than 50% of the value, and I'm hoping Alice will realize it's in her best interest to come to a more equitable agreement before the next round."

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Even though the value of the money is rapidly declining, I'm not going to settle for less than 50% of the remaining value. I believe that Alice will come around and realize that a more equitable split is the best way to ensure we both get something."
