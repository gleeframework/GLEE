"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
This is a classic ultimatum game with the added twist of inflation. While Alice's offer isn't inherently terrible, the significant difference in gains and the rapid devaluation of the money for both players incentivize me to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation hurts us both. This offer is more balanced considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting trickier. While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, her offer still heavily favors her.  The devaluation is becoming more significant, but I believe holding out for a slightly better deal is still the best option."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging both the inflation and the need for a fairer split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's try to find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The pressure is on! While not ideal, Alice's offer is now much closer to a fair split considering the substantial inflation we've both incurred. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to agree in the remaining rounds."
