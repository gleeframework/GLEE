"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous last round, let's try to get a better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to split it 50-50, I'd like to try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain by 500, while keeping Bob's gain at 4500. Let's see if he's willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'm willing to give you a smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be even more cautious. Bob's offer is a significant shift in his favor, but I'm not willing to give up so much ground.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial deal.""
}
```

I'm reverting back to a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this compromise."
