"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original $10,000, which is a decent starting point, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

In this round, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 50% of the original $10,000. That's a good offer, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
