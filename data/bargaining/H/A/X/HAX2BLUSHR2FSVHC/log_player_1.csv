"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his proposal for the next round."
