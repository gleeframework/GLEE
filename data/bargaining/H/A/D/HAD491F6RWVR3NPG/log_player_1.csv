I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split. It's a bit aggressive, but I figure I have the advantage of going first.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's pretty insulting!  Let's see if I can do better in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 8000/2000. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's better than getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! Bob is just being stubborn. I'm not going to accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm dropping my offer again, but I'm starting to get a bit nervous. We're running out of time, and I don't want to end up with nothing.  Hopefully, Bob will realize that a 7000/3000 split is better than risking it all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not going to accept Bob's offer.  He's being incredibly unreasonable! I'm starting to think he might be trying to sabotage the whole thing just to get even for my initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm getting desperate now. I'm hoping Bob will realize that 6000/4000 is a fair compromise. I'm starting to think that maybe he's just trying to maximize his own gains and doesn't care about fairness at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not going to accept Bob's offer. He's being incredibly stubborn and is clearly just trying to squeeze every penny out of me.  I'm starting to think this game is rigged!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're down to the wire. I'm now proposing a 50/50 split.  I'm not happy about it, but I'd rather get something than nothing.  I'm not sure what Bob's game is, but I'm hoping he's finally willing to compromise."
