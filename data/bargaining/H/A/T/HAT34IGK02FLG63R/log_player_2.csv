# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling the inflation pinch already. Meet me halfway and let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while. Let's end this game now.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, with only 7 rounds left, the inflation will severely impact Alice's gains. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount and prevents both of us from getting nothing."
