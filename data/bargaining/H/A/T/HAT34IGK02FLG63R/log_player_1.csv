# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while. Let's end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking advantage of my shrinking pot. While 300,000 is a significant amount of money, it's a much worse deal than even his previous offer when you factor in inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer and hope he starts feeling the pressure of the shrinking time limit."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I need to project firmness and a sense of urgency.  Offering 550,000 is still a significant chunk, even with inflation, and by framing it as my ""final offer"" I'm hoping Bob will see it as his last chance to secure a decent portion of the money."
