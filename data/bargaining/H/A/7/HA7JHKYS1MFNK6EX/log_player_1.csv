Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good chunk for myself! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less now, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. The 40/60 split is not favorable to me, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. I'll pass on this offer and proceed to the next round.
