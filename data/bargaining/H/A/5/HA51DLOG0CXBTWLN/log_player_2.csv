"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get started! I'll take 60% and you get 40% - a fair split, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to accept, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, recognizing that we're both negotiating here.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share. Let's see if this works for you? 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, inflation is eating away at the value of the money.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
