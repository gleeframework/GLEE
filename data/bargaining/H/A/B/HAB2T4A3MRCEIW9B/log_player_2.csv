Alice's offer:

{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Your offer was quite greedy, Alice. How about a more even split this time? 60/40 seems fair considering the money loses value for you in each round.""

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, I see your point.  Let's split it 60/40 this time.  It's a fair compromise, and I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
