Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was quite greedy, Alice. How about a more even split this time? 60/40 seems fair considering the money loses value for you in each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
