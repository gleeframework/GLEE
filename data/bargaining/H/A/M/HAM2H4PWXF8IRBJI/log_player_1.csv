"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reasonable, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 60-40 split in Bob's favor is reasonable, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more balanced split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is closer to my original offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. My message is a friendly reminder that I'm willing to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
