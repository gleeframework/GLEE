"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming to get a good chunk of the money, but I also want to make sure Bob gets a fair share so he's likely to accept.  Let's see how this plays out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While this offer is a lot more even, it's still way less than I initially wanted.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal, especially since I know the money is losing value quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar split to my initial offer but increase the value to Bob slightly. It's a gamble, but I think it will be enough to tempt him into accepting this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  This offer at least gives me a decent share, and it's not worth risking getting nothing."
