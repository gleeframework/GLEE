"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave 30 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my effective gain in this round is 70 * 0.95 = 66.5 dollars.

Bob's offer is 60 dollars for me, which is more than my effective gain in this round. I'll accept the offer.
