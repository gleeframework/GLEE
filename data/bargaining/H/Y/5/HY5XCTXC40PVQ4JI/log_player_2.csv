"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 4000 is a decent amount, I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's a more even distribution, and I'm sure we can both agree it's a fair starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is money, and it's losing value fast. I'm proposing a 58/42 split. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, time is indeed money. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent sum, and the risk of getting nothing at all is too high."
