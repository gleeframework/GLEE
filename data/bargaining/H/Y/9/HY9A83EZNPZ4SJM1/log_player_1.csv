"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as Alice. I want to secure the majority of the money in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less for Bob in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can secure a better deal in the future rounds.  The inflation penalty is far higher for Bob than for me, giving me an advantage in negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering a slightly smaller share to Bob this time, recognizing the inflation factor and my advantage in negotiation.  I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough to secure a deal before the money further depreciates for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even with the inflation, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. The inflation penalty is much higher for Bob, and he is likely desperate at this point. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still confident I can secure a deal. Bob's desperation is increasing due to the inflation, and I believe this offer will be tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Despite the significant inflation penalty for Bob, I believe I can secure a better deal. I still have the advantage, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant share.  The inflation penalty is now very high for Bob, and I believe he's nearing a point where he'll accept anything to avoid getting nothing at all."
