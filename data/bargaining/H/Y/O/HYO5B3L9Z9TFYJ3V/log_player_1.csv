"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good deal, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$, which is 30% of the original amount. I'll keep 700,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but let's both get a good share.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, I'll consider the effective value of the money, taking into account the 20% decrease.

My gain would be 400,000, which is worth 80% of 500,000 (the original amount I was offered in the first round). That's a decent deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a bigger share to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to keep up with inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$, which is 40% of the original amount, but it's worth more than what he would have gotten in the previous round. I'll keep 600,000$ for myself."
