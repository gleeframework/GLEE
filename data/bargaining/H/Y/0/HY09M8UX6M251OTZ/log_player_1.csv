"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and leaving Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get us closer to a fair split 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased due to inflation!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'd like to make a new proposal."
