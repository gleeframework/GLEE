Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be a bit higher, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is slightly better than her previous one, Alice is clearly using the inflation against me. I need to hold out for a better deal, as accepting this offer would mean I'm losing a significant chunk of the initial value due to the inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit from inflation, but I'm offering you a slight edge still. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, this is getting ridiculous. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going below this. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me!  At this point, accepting 44 dollars is better than risking getting a worse offer in a later round where the money is worth even less.  Alice seems firm on not going lower, and waiting any longer will just hurt me more."
