"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since I know that the money is worth 10% less now, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly. With this offer, I'll be getting $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. That's a pretty good deal, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
