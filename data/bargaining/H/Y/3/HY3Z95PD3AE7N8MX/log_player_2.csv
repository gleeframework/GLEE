It's painful, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:** The value of the potential money I could gain is rapidly decreasing. 
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly playing hardball, knowing my position weakens each round.  
* **No Guarantee:** There's no guarantee she'll offer anything better, and holding out risks getting a much worse deal or even nothing.

Getting $3,000 is better than risking $0 in the next round, even if it's significantly less than what I could have had."
