"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a bold move, Bob. I'll take the whole $100. Don't bother responding, it's a done deal!""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening bid, hoping Bob will be eager to negotiate and respond with a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable starting point, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less from the previous round), I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze in a better offer now that the money is worth less. I'll consider this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 60 is the best I can get, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 19.38% less now (5% + 14.26%), I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a bigger share to make this deal worthwhile.""
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up on getting a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot. I'll consider this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 65 is a good compromise, and I'm willing to settle for this share. It's not the maximum I could have gotten, but it's a reasonable split."
