"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equal split is fair. Let's go with this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a good deal for me, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and we can still split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my original offer, but still gives Bob a decent share of the money."
