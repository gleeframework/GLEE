"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to take a bit less to get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is tempting, it's in Bob's best interest to reject and see if he can get a better deal.  The inflation will hurt him in future rounds, so he should try to maximize his gains before that happens."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a slightly better deal. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. We both get more than we would in the next round due to inflation.""
}
