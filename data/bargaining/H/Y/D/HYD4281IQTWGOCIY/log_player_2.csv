"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob.  Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money's value decreases by 10% for me each round, and it doesn't for Alice, I'll try to get a better deal. An even split isn't fair given the circumstances.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! Make your next offer. I'll be waiting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the depreciation of the money's value for me.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be a bit more flexible. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I still need a fair deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, my share of 45 is actually worth less than it appears, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next rounds.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! Make your next offer. I'll be waiting.
###\n\nAlso, note that I am still waiting for a more reasonable offer that takes into account the depreciation of the money's value for me. The current offer does not offset the loss from inflation.\n\n###\n\nLet's continue negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation on my share.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the rising inflation, I need a larger share to offset the loss. This is a more reasonable split under the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! Consider the impact of inflation on my end.\n\n###\n\nLet's try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 40/60 to account for the inflation, but I won't go lower than that. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of my share by 34.39%, I believe this offer is reasonable. The proposed split of 60 for me and 40 for Alice offsets the loss due to inflation to some extent.\n\n###\n\nGiven that Alice has indicated she won't go lower than this offer, and considering the decreasing value of the money for me with each passing round, I think accepting this offer is the best decision to avoid further losses.\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the agreement and split the money according to Alice's offer in round 5.\n\n###\n\nGame over!"
