"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. My reasoning is that the offer is not entirely fair considering the inflation rates. Alice loses 10% of the value each round, while I lose 20%. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more reasonable offer. Let's come to an agreement before the money loses more value.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the inflation rates and the fact that Alice loses less value each round. By giving her a slightly larger share, I'm hoping to entice her to accept the offer before the money loses more value. The message is designed to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and encourage her to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. Time is running out and this is the best deal you'll get. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems reasonable, considering the inflation rates, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. The fact that Alice is willing to meet in the middle suggests that she is open to compromise, and I'd like to take advantage of that in the next round. Additionally, the money is still worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing more value in the hopes of getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's settle this before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account Alice's willingness to meet in the middle and the fact that the money is losing value rapidly. I've increased my share slightly, while still giving Alice a larger share, in the hopes that she will accept the offer and we can both walk away with a decent amount. The message is designed to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept the offer."
