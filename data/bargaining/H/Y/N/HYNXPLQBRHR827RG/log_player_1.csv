"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. The message is a friendly suggestion to split the money in a way that seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even. 60/40 sounds fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer, I think 60/40 is a bit more even than my initial proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the money's value by another 20%, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I'm not going to get left with nothing!""
}
```

I'm offering to take a smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
