"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which I think is a generous offer considering the inflation rates. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game here.\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more advantageous. This is a decent offer, take it or lose more next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth less for Bob than for me, I'm hoping he'll be more willing to compromise as the game goes on.\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's end this!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 42 dollars this time. Since the money is worth less for him than for me, I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept this offer and end the game. I'm still getting a bigger share, but I'm trying to be somewhat reasonable.\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
