"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, let's start with a high offer for you!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous, now it's your turn to be more realistic! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a decrease in the amount he's willing to give me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not being realistic, I'm giving you a fair share!""
}
```

I'm trying to push the envelope and see if Bob will accept a slightly smaller share for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to meet in the middle, no more games! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more reasonable now. Considering the inflation effect, his offer is actually a relatively small share for me, but I suppose it's a fair compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
