"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We can both get a good chunk of the money this way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I would receive $500,000, but its value would be equivalent to $400,000 in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my goal is to maximize the value of my share.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. My message is a compromise, suggesting that I need a bit more to account for the inflation, but I'm still willing to meet in the middle."
