"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll reassess Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll consider the effective values to be:

My gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44 (due to 10% inflation)
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 (due to 20% inflation)

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting a smaller share in terms of effective value. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the ongoing inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less with each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```
I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values of the money considering the inflation:

My gain: 3000 / (1 - 0.271) = 3000 / 0.729 = 4118.13 (due to 27.1% inflation)
Bob's gain: 7000 / (1 - 0.488) = 7000 / 0.512 = 1367.19 (due to 48.8% inflation)

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting a significantly smaller share in terms of effective value.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the ongoing inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 37.9% less than in the first round (cumulative inflation of 27.1% + 10% + 0% + 0%), I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 5:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500
}
```
I'm offering to take 85% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 15%."
