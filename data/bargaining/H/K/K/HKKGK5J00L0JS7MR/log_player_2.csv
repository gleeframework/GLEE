"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide the money in a way that we both get a significant amount. Since I'm making the first offer, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. This way, we both get something substantial, and we can avoid further rounds that would decrease the value of the money for me.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my initial offer. I'll take 58% this time, and you can have 42%. This is still a generous offer, and I believe we should settle on this to avoid further decreases in value for me.
