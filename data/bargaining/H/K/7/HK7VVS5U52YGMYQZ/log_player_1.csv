"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm giving Bob 20% of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'd rather not settle for 500,000. I'll try to get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than I did in the first round, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less now. Considering the current value of the money, Bob's offer is actually quite generous. I'll take it.
