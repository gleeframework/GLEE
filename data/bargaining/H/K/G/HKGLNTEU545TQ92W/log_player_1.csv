"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a classic game theory problem.  I'm taking a slightly greedy approach by offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll accept it to avoid getting nothing in subsequent rounds.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's in my best interest to accept this offer.  While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, refusing this offer means I might get nothing in the next round.  A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome."
