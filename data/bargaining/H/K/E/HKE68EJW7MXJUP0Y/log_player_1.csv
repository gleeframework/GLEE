"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. I'll consider Bob's offer carefully.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still a 50-50 split, and I'm not sure if Bob's gain is being affected by inflation as little as I am. I want to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a reasonable offer given the current economic conditions."
