"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Determine the offer to make in Round 2.
Given that Alice's initial offer was a 40-60 split, which was deemed unfair, the next offer should aim to find a more equitable distribution while also considering strategic negotiation. A common approach in negotiation games like this is to start with an extreme position and gradually move towards a compromise. However, since we're looking for a fair starting point after rejecting Alice's offer, proposing a split closer to 50-50 seems reasonable but still slightly favorable to me to leave room for negotiation.

### Step 2: Craft the message to Alice.
The message should explain the reasoning behind the offer and aim to persuade Alice that this is a fairer starting point for negotiation than her initial offer. It should also subtly suggest that there's room for further negotiation, encouraging her to either accept this offer or make a counteroffer that's more favorable than the initial one.

### Step 3: Finalize the offer and message in the required JSON format.
Based on the steps above, the offer and message should be structured as follows:

```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering your initial offer, I believe a split closer to 50-50 is more equitable. This offer still gives me a slight edge, reflecting my belief that my contribution or value to our partnership warrants it. However, I'm open to further negotiation to find a mutually agreeable split.""
}
```

This approach aims to balance assertiveness with openness to negotiation, providing a basis for Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it down the middle. I'm willing to meet you halfway to avoid going back and forth further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Alice's offer in Round 3.
Alice is now offering a 50-50 split, which is a significant concession from her initial 40-60 proposal. This indicates her willingness to compromise and meet halfway.

### Step 2: Consider the negotiation history and potential future outcomes.
Given that my counteroffer of a 55-45 split was rejected, Alice's current offer of an equal split seems to be a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate for a slightly better deal risks Alice reverting to a less favorable offer or prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily.

### Step 3: Decide on the acceptance of Alice's offer.
Considering the steps above and the goal of reaching a mutually agreeable division with minimal rounds of negotiation, accepting Alice's offer of a 50-50 split seems prudent. This decision reflects a balance between assertiveness in negotiation and the recognition of a fair compromise.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
