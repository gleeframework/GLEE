"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money as time passes, but the losses are more significant for you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that my losses are significantly smaller than hers. I can hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I believe we can find a split that's more equitable given the differing inflation rates. This offer reflects a compromise, but I'm willing to negotiate further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a more equitable split, but your previous offer didn't account for the rapid devaluation of my share. This is my counter-offer, and time is of the essence for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is closer to my previous proposal, Alice's offer still doesn't fully account for the inflation disparity.  I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the urgency of the situation, but I believe we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Given the inflation differential, a 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's not let the clock run out on this opportunity.""}
