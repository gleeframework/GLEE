Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offer is still not favorable.  The inflation is hurting him more than it's hurting me.  I'll hold out for a better deal."
