Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is worth less each round.  Since the money is worth 36% less for Bob, the offer of $2,000 is significantly lower than the initial $1,000 offer in real terms. 
* **Alice's Advantage:** Alice's gains are only reduced by 9.75%, meaning she's still getting a larger share of the pie and likely sees a lot of value in continuing the game.  
* **Potential for Better Offer:** Bob still has the opportunity to make an offer in the next round.  Even with inflation, a more even split (or one that favors Bob more) is potentially achievable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While inflation is a concern, Bob needs to balance this with the fact that Alice is also experiencing inflation, just at a lower rate. 
* **Fairness:** Offering a 60/40 split still gives Alice a significant share, but it's a fairer compromise than the previous rounds.  
* **Risk:**  If Bob keeps rejecting, Alice might be willing to accept a closer to even split in a later round to avoid further delays and possible loss of money due to inflation.
* **Prior Offers:** Bob's previous offer of 9000/1000 was clearly too aggressive for Alice, so this offer is more balanced.

By offering a more reasonable share, Bob increases his chances of getting an agreement while still acknowledging the need to account for inflation."
