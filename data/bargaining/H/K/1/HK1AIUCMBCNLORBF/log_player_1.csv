"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm the boss! 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a slightly higher share to compensate. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a higher share to make up for the loss. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but I need more for myself!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll! Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to hold on to what I can. I'll accept Bob's offer this time, hoping to salvage something.
