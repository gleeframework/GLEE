Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the initial amount. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point. While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split considering the inflation, time is working heavily against me.  I need to incentivize her to accept in the next round or two before the diminishing returns make it pointless."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

A 50/50 split becomes the most strategic offer for several reasons:

* **Urgency:** With only six rounds left, the value of the money is plummeting. Waiting any longer significantly hurts both players.
* **Fairness:**  While the initial inflation rates favor Bob, a 50/50 split presents a strong argument for fairness that Alice may be more likely to accept under pressure.
* **Preventing a Collapse:**  Offering anything less than 50/50 at this stage risks completely alienating Alice, likely leading her to gamble on increasingly unfavorable offers in later rounds, which would be disastrous for both."
