"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to compromise or if he's aiming for an even split.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial proposal.  While the inflation effect is hurting the value of the money, it's not enough to make me accept such a drastic shift in the split. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with my initial strategy of offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but adjust it slightly in light of Bob's aggressive offer. I'll decrease my share by 10% to see if he's willing to compromise a bit. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before the inflation hurts us both too badly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round.  I know inflation is hitting him harder than me, but I can't accept a split that gives me such a small share.  I'll try to negotiate again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually reducing my share, but I'm going to offer a bit more to Bob this time, hoping that his desire to avoid a complete loss will outweigh his desire for an even bigger share. We're getting closer to the end of the game, so I'll need to find a compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too unfavorable for me, even with the significant inflation impact on him.  I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal. I'll reject and continue to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to reduce my share by 10% again. We're running out of rounds, so I need to be more flexible.  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough to Bob to finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, it's still not acceptable. The inflation is hurting us both, but I'm not ready to give up a significant share yet. I'll reject his offer and try to reach a compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're running out of time, and it's clear that we're both unwilling to budge too much.  I'm going to offer a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob recognizes the urgency of the situation and accepts.  If we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both be left with nothing."
