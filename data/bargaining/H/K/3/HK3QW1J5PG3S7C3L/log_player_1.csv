"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm less concerned about the inflation. On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, which makes this offer more attractive to me.

I accept the offer.
