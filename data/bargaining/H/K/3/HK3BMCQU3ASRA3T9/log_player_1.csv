"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a significant share of the money, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 5% less this round, my gain of 4000 is equivalent to 3800 in real value compared to the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the reduced value of money, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount to compensate. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob, but still trying to maximize my gain in the face of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain! With a 14.26% decrease in value, my gain of 4500 is equivalent to around 3950 in real value compared to the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth less, I'll need to be more cautious. I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really taking its toll now. With the reduced value of money, I'll need to be even more aggressive in my offer to compensate. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm going back to my original offer from Round 1, but with the knowledge that the money is worth even less now. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and ending the game."
