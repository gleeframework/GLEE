"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of money with each round, I'd like to reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer takes into account the decreasing value of money and gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate."
