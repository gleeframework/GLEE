"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still being generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40/60 split. I'd like to try to negotiate for a more equal share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55% to account for the inflation and the decreasing value of money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. I think I can still do better than a 46/54 split, especially considering the decreasing value of money. I'll try to push for a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the further decrease in the value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob! I'm taking a firmer stance, but I'm still willing to listen.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60% to account for the accelerating inflation and the decreasing value of money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Don't think you're getting the better end of the stick! 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to hold on to a larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a better deal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially worse offer in the next round. 52/48 seems like a reasonable compromise, given the circumstances."
