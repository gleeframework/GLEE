"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with getting just a dollar.  Perhaps he'll be motivated to make a better offer in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer and the money is getting devalued quickly, so it's better to accept this."
