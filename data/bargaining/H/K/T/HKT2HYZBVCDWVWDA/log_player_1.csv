Let's see if Bob goes for a larger share right away or prefers to wait and see."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too generous towards yourself.  How about a 60/40 split? It's still in your favor, and we can avoid inflation eating into our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is better than his potential gain in the next round, but I'm willing to bet he'll be more reasonable as the inflation increases. Let's see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Time is literally money in this game! I'll offer you 35 which is more than you'd get in the next round. Take it before inflation eats away at it even more!""
}
```

We're shifting the blame to inflation and highlighting the opportunity cost of waiting. Let's see if Bob takes the bait this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth isn't getting us anywhere. Let's split this evenly and call it a day. 50/50 - a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher share in the next round or two, the gains would be minimal compared to the risk of the money losing even more value. 
* **Bob's Position:** Bob has been consistently moving towards a more even split. It's unlikely he'll accept anything significantly lower than 50% at this point. 

Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share before inflation eats away at the potential gains further."
