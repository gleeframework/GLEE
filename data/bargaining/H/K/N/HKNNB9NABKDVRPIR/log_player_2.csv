Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round due to inflation, but for Alice, the value remains the same.

### Step 2: Analyze previous offers and outcomes
Alice initially offered a 60-40 split in her favor, which I rejected. Then, I proposed a 55-45 split in my favor, considering the inflation, but Alice rejected it. In Round 3, Alice offered a 55-45 split in her favor, emphasizing the impact of inflation on my gains, which I also rejected.

### Step 3: Consider the impact of inflation on future rounds
Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me, it's crucial to try and reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, since Alice's value remains unaffected, she might be inclined to wait, expecting the inflation to pressure me into accepting a less favorable deal.

### Step 4: Determine the next offer
Considering the above factors, my next offer should still try to maximize my gain but also be more attractive to Alice than the previous offers. Since Alice was willing to accept $55 in the previous round, I could offer her slightly more, while still trying to get a bit more than the $45 she offered me, balancing the deal with the inflation in mind.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer and message
Given the considerations, I'll offer Alice $58 and take $42 for myself. The message will highlight the increasing urgency due to inflation and the need for a mutually acceptable deal.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's find a middle ground before it's too late.""}"
