"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure if meeting halfway is the best approach, considering the inflation. I was hoping for a slightly better deal, especially since I'm losing value due to the inflation. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round to make my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A bit more for me, considering the inflation""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to take into account the 10% loss in value due to inflation. I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a slightly more favorable ratio for me. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'm willing to give you more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I have to admit, Bob's offer is tempting. Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer. The 45-55 split is still a bit better for me than the 27.1% loss I'd incur if I rejected the offer and continued playing. I'll take the deal and finalize the division."
