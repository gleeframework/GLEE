Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's split the difference. I'll take 65% and you get 35%. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to take a large portion of the money. While her offer is better, it's worth holding out a little longer and seeing if she becomes more reasonable as the stakes get higher with inflation."
