"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the money.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal division of the money. It's fair and ensures we both benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's proposal is a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer. I'll consider it carefully.

However, I'm not sure if Bob is aware of the inflation effect on the money's value. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting $500,000, which is worth 95% of the original $1,000,000. But if I wait, the money will be worth even less in the next round.

I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to make a better offer next time.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get the majority of the money. You can do better, right?""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the money, which is worth 95% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness. This offer splits the money evenly, considering the inflation impact on its value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, it looks like Bob has adjusted his offer to take into account the inflation! With the money worth 14.26% less than the original $1,000,000, I'd be getting $400,000, which is worth 82.74% of the original amount.

Considering the inflation and Bob's revised offer, I think this is a decent deal. I'll accept the offer.
