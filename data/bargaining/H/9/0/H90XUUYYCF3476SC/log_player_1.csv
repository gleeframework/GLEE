"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I think this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the inflation is working against me, Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  It's better to hold out for a fairer deal, even with the shrinking pot. Accepting 42 now sets a bad precedent and Bob might offer even less next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, and the deal is getting worse for me each round.  Let's settle this now with a relatively even split.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is on my side, and inflation is taking its toll. This is my best offer yet 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation increasing, I'm getting a worse deal each round.  If I reject this, Bob is likely to offer me even less next time, potentially pushing me below 40. Taking the 40 now guarantees me something, even though it's heavily influenced by Bob's advantage with the inflation mechanic."
