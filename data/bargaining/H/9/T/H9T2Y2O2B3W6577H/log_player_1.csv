"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, let's see if you can keep it up! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better deal after my initial proposal was rejected. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly bigger share. Let's see if you'll accept this offer!""}

I'm trying to find a balance between my initial proposal and Bob's offer. I'm willing to give up a bit more to see if Bob will accept this compromise."
