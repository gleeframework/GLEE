"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, but still leave Bob with a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate. However, I don't want to be too greedy, as I don't know how Bob's offer will change in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
