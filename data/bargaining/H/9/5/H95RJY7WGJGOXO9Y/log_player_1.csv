"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I propose a 990,000$ for me and 10,000$ for Bob. It's a significant advantage for me, but I want to leave room for negotiation and avoid Bob rejecting the offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation means my share of the money is diminishing with each round, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer me more in the future.  A 500,000$ gain is significant, and the risk of getting nothing is too high."
