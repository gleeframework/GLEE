I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer! I'll take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with only $1. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as he'll get something out of it and we can both move on. However, if he rejects, I know the value of the money will decrease for me with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer than the previous one, and although the value of the money is lower for me now, I'm better off getting 500,000 now than risking it all for a chance at a larger, but potentially nonexistent, share in the next round."
