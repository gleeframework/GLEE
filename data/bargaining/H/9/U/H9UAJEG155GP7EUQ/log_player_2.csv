Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 4000.  Let's meet in the middle at 4500 for me and 5500 for you.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```tool_code
print(""This seems like a reasonable offer considering the inflation and the alternative of going another round with more losses for Alice. I accept!"")
