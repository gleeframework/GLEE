Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting hard!

Considering the drastic decrease in value of the money I'll gain, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. However, I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal, so I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer. I'll take the 10 dollars and hope that I can do better in the future."
