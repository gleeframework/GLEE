Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The fact that the money is worth less to Bob than to me gives me some leverage to negotiate further. Let's see what happens next!"
