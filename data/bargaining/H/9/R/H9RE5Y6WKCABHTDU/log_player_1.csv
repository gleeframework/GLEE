  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money 80/20 in my favor, since I'm taking a risk by rejecting your offer. We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
