Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it closer to even. I'm willing to take $55, and leave you with $45.  It's a fair deal, and we can avoid the inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
