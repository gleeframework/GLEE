"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done quickly! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is fair, considering the initial proposal was already a 60-40 split. I'd like to try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 55-45 split, Bob. Can we meet in the middle at 57.5-42.5?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it down the middle at 55-45, but with a slight tweak to 55.3-44.7. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to my preferred 60-40 split, but I'm willing to compromise."
