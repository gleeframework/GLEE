"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving Bob a significant share of the money, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems to be a mirror image of my initial offer, which makes me think he's trying to negotiate from a strong position.

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, and I'm not sure how much Bob values the money, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast! With the inflation rate, my gain is now worth significantly less than in the first round. Bob's offer seems to be taking advantage of the situation, and he's getting a larger share.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm not sure if Bob will make a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing even more value.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is continuing to lose value rapidly! With the inflation rate, my gain is now worth 21.26% less than in the first round.

Considering the situation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm taking an even larger share, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept. Let's see if he'll bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value at an alarming rate! With the inflation rate, my gain is now worth a tiny fraction of its original value.

Considering the situation, I'm starting to get desperate. Bob's offer is a very good one for him, but I'm not sure if I have a better option. I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer and risk losing even more value.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
