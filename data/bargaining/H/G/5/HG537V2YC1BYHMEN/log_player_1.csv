"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach this time. You can try to counteroffer if you want more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Given the offer, I'll calculate the actual values:

Alice's gain: 300,000 * 0.8 = 240,000 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: 700,000 * 0.9 = 630,000 (due to 10% inflation)

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too aggressive, I'll try to get a better deal""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better. Let's see if you can meet me in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: 450,000 * 0.5162 = 231,348 (due to 48.8% inflation)
Bob's gain: 550,000 * 0.7239 = 398,155 (due to 27.1% inflation)

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
