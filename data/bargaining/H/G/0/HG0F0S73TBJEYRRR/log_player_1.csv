"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting a bit more for taking the initiative.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 40/60 split. I'll make a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll think carefully and come up with a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 45 is a fair amount for me""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, giving Bob a slightly larger share than my initial offer, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
