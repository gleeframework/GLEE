"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to share some. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While getting something is better than nothing, Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That's not fair, Alice. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need more than 4000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is stalling, hoping I'll panic as the deadline approaches. While her offer is better, it's still not a fair split. I need to counter quickly but firmly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. Let's split the difference from our previous offers and end this.""}
```"
