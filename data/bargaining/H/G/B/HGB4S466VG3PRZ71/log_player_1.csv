"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. We both get a decent amount, and it's not too far off from what I would have gotten in the last round with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
