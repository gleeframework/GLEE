"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a slightly larger share, but still offering a fair split. It's important to start with a good offer to avoid risking a rejection and potential loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation factor is starting to hurt.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the difference in my earnings is relatively small compared to the potential loss in future rounds."
