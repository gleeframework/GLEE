Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I understand you want to be fair, but that offer wasn't reasonable to me. Let's try this split instead.  Remember, the value decreases quickly with each round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
