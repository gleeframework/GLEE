Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000 and give Bob 1000. This leaves a lot of room for negotiation in future rounds, as the money will be worth less with each passing round. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept the deal, as he'll have the opportunity to propose a better split for himself later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money, even though it's worth slightly less than the initial offer. It's a good strategy to avoid risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
