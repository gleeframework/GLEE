"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate in the next round if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount, hoping to give him an incentive to negotiate and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

My gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.50
Bob's gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I think this is a good offer, and I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split. I'll take the deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
