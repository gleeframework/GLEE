Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  While the time pressure is on, accepting a 40/60 split sets a bad precedent.  Alice knows I'm aiming for a more equitable split. By rejecting this, I signal I'm willing to risk it for a better deal in the later rounds."
