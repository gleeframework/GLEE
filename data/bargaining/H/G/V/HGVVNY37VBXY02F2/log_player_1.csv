"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with inflation! 

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 30-70 split, especially considering the money is worth less for me now. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, giving me $4,200 and Bob $5,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself this time! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can still get a better deal, especially considering the money is worth less for me now. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the value of the money!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, giving me $4,500 and Bob $5,500."
