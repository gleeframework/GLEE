Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{

Bob's offer is getting better for him and worse for me with each round. I need to push for a better split before the inflation eats up too much of my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""This offer is closer to a 50/50 split after inflation is factored in, Bob. Let's be fair.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal after Bob had the advantage of declining offers for several rounds, accepting is the best option at this point. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds.
* **Bob's unlikely to budge:** Bob knows he's in a strong position. He's likely to continue proposing slightly better offers for himself, knowing the pressure is on me due to the inflation. 

A 50/50 split ensures I get something, even if it's not the optimal amount."
