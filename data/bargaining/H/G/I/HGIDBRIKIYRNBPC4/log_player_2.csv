Let's see what Alice offers next.  I'm hoping for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get a slightly better deal for myself this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with inflation, getting 500,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds.  It's a fair split, and I don't want to push my luck."
