"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly biased, offer.  I'm willing to give you 10% of the money, but I'll take 90%.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. With inflation, the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, but it's also worth 5% less for Alice. I'm hoping to get a more even split or at least a larger share.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced offer, considering the inflation. I'll take 45% and you can have 55%. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's more fair than the initial 10% you offered me.""}\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
