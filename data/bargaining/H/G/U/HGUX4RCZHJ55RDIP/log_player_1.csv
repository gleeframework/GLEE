"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'd be getting $450,000, which is worth 20% less than the $600,000 I could have gotten in the first round. And Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. So, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This way, I'm aiming for a slightly more favorable split, considering the reduced value of the money."
