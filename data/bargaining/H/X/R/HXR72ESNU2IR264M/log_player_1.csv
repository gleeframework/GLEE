Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous and giving Bob a small share.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. It's a huge drop from my initial proposal and it feels unfair.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a fair share.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we need to compromise to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is really hurting me.  I won't accept this offer.  I'll try to make a more appealing proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both losing out with each passing round, and this is the best way to maximize our gains before the inflation makes it impossible to reach a deal."
