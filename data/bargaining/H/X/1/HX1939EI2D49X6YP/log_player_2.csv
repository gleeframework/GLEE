"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for Bob! While it might seem like a decent chunk of money, I'm sure we can negotiate a much better deal. Let's see what Alice says in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you 350,000. That's a good deal considering the inflation!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than that.  Let's split it 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to move in the right direction, but this is still not a good deal for Bob, especially with the inflation eating into his potential gains. Let's hold out a bit longer and see if we can nudge her closer to a more equitable split."
