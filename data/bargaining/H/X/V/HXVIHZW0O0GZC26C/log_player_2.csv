"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you 40% of the money, which is a fair starting point. Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer heavily favors Alice. While starting with a somewhat fair offer makes sense,  a 60/40 split is too far off.  I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's split the difference and I'll take a slightly smaller share to move things along.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's time we compromised. I'm willing to take a 50/50 split, let's agree to this and avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is fair, and with inflation eating away at the value, it's best to settle now and avoid further losses."
