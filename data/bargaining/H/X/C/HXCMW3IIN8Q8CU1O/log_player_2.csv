"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob.  Take this small share now, or risk getting nothing at all in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
Even though the offer is small, it's better to reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round. The inflation means that if I accept, I get a very small amount, and Alice gets almost all of it. By rejecting, I can potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly. We both get a good amount this way, and we can avoid the risk of losing money to inflation.""}
