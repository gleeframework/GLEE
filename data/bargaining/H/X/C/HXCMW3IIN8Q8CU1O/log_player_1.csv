Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this fairly. We both get a good amount this way, and we can avoid the risk of losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
