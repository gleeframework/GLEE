"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000 dollars for myself and leaving 100,000 dollars for Bob. This is a fair deal considering the potential for inflation and the fact that I am the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. Inflation is a real threat, and waiting for another round means getting 5% less of the money I'm already losing. This offer is fair, and I'm happy to take it."
