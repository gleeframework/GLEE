"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but you'll get a decent chunk too.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
