This is a great start to a game! I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a fair division right now, I know the money will be worth less to Alice in the future rounds. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation will affect your share more than mine.  Let's get this done!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on me, I'm making a compromise. Let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is going to significantly hurt Alice's share if we continue.  It's better to take a slightly smaller portion now than risk losing it all in the later rounds."
