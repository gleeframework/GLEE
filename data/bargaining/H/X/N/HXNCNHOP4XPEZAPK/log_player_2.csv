**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the deal is getting worse, accepting this offer would mean I lose a significant amount of potential earnings. It's worth the risk to hold out a bit longer and hope for a better offer or to propose a more reasonable split in the next round."

# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, as time is running out. However, Alice is clearly exploiting the situation, and accepting this offer would mean losing a huge chunk of the potential earnings. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping she might become more reasonable in the next round as we approach the deadline."
