It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is slightly better than the first round, but I'm still hoping to get a larger share. I'll see what she proposes next."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment in this negotiation.  Let's find a middle ground.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, let's settle on this 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd still prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is getting increasingly less appealing due to the inflation impacting her more significantly. It's time to settle on a deal before the value drops further."
