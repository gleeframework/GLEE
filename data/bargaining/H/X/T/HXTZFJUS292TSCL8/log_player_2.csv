Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a solution where we both get something decent. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to concede more, but I need a larger share to make this worth it. Let's settle this before the inflation gets out of hand. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer ensures I receive something substantial before the value diminishes further.  Delaying carries too much risk now.
