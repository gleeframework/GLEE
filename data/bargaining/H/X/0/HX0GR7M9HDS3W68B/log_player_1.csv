"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'm willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I feel like I'm giving away too much. I was hoping for a better deal, and this one doesn't quite cut it. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can come to a better agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the total amount, which is $550,000, and Bob gets 45%, which is $450,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, I want a bigger share now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my offer!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to give up that much more. I was already willing to compromise in round 3, and this offer is too extreme. I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a better deal than he would have gotten earlier in the game. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make a deal""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the inflation has taken a toll on the value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in this offer and be willing to accept it."
