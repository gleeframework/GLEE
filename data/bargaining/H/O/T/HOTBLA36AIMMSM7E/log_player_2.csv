Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's a game of diminishing returns.  Here's why I accepted:

* **Severe Inflation:** I'm losing almost 20% of the value every round I wait. 
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers are getting worse, not better. Waiting longer is likely to result in even worse offers.
* **Better Than Nothing:** While $4,300 is much less than I wanted, it's better than holding out, getting a worse offer, and losing more to inflation. 

It's a bitter pill, but waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse outcome."
