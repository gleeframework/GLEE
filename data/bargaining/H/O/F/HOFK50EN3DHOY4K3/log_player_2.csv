Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll take the 45 dollars. With inflation, it's better to get something now rather than risk losing more value in the next round."
