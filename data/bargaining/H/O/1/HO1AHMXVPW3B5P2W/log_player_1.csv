"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a higher share, but I'm not going for 3:1. This is a fair 60:40 split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
