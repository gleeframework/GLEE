"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering you $1,000, and I'll take the remaining $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for me now.

I accept Bob's offer.
