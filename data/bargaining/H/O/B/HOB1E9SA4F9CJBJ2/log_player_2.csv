Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is more than fair! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, and the value keeps decreasing. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said it's your final offer, but I think you can do better considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  Alice is clearly holding out, and the value for me is diminishing rapidly. Accepting $3000 now is better than risking getting even less next round."
