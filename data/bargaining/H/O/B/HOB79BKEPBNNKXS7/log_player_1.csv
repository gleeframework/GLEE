"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll actually get $6,400 (80% of $8,000) if I accept this offer. That's a good deal for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
