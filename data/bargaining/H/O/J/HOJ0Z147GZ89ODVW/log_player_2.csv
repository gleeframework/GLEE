"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and saves us both from losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. My turn now, and this offer ensures we both benefit significantly before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
```
 
Let's break down why this offer is strategic:
 
* **Capitalizing on Rejection:** Alice's first offer was heavily skewed in her favor. By rejecting it, we signaled that we're not pushovers and are aiming for a more equitable split.
* **Pre-empting Inflation:** While the money loses value with each round, Alice's losses are less significant than ours. This offer secures a good portion of the money before inflation further diminishes its worth for both of us.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By offering Alice a still substantial $4500, we maintain an appearance of fairness. This increases the chances of her accepting the offer rather than risking further losses due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be smart about this.  Inflation is hurting you more than me. Take this deal while it's still good! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to use inflation to pressure me into a bad deal.  While I am losing value faster, 4200 is too significant a drop from my initial target. I need to signal I'm willing to wait for a more balanced offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair solution. This offer reflects the time pressure while acknowledging your advantage. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Strategy:**  Alice is playing tough, but her last offer was still heavily in her favor. We need to show we're willing to compromise but won't be exploited.
* **Time Pressure:** Every round hurts us more. Offering a slight majority to ourselves with this offer is a final attempt to secure a reasonable win before inflation eats significantly into the pot.
* **Direct Communication:** The message aims to convey seriousness and a desire to end the negotiation fairly. We acknowledge Alice's position but make it clear this offer is our bottom line.

By round 4, the risk of Alice holding out for an even better deal in later rounds is significant.  This offer attempts to strike a balance between getting a decent share and ensuring Alice is incentivized to accept."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth is costing us both.  My offer is fair and it's the last one I'm making.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is playing hardball, and her final offer ultimatum leaves me with a tough choice.  Let's analyze:

* **Significant Losses:** Inflation has eroded the value considerably. Accepting 4500 now is worth significantly less than what we could have gotten in earlier rounds.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her ""take it or leave it"" message indicates she's unlikely to budge further.  Holding out risks her sticking to this offer in the next round, where it will be worth even less.
* **The Alternative:** If I reject this offer, the best-case scenario is getting Alice to agree to a slightly better split in the next round.  However, the value will have decreased further due to inflation, and there's a real chance she won't budge.

**Conclusion:**  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer cuts my losses. Holding out carries a significant risk with only a marginal potential reward. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the best course of action under these circumstances."
