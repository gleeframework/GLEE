Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

This is my final push. With only two rounds left, the inflation is going to hit both of us hard. I'm hoping to get a large share, even if it's slightly less than my first offer. Bob's potential gain is dwindling, and I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid getting nothing."

# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still far from a fair deal. With both of us losing value rapidly due to inflation,  I'm not willing to settle for such a low share. Even though we're both facing the risk of getting nothing, I'd rather stand my ground and hope for a better outcome."
