"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 5% less than the original $1,000,000, which is $950,000. I'll have to consider Bob's offer carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation effect. Since my gain is worth 5% less than the original $1,000,000, it's now worth $950,000. I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! My gain is now worth 14.26% less than the original $1,000,000, which is $856,400. I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since my gain is worth less, I'll aim to get a larger share to make up for it. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
