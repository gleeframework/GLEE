"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, but I think a 60/40 split is a more reasonable starting point. Let's see if we can do better than Alice's initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
