"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $999,999 and give Bob $1. This is a classic ultimatum game strategy, aiming to get the most possible in the first round.  Let's see if Bob is willing to take that small amount or gamble on a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to get more, it's important to consider the inflation factor. With each round, my share loses value.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a significant amount, and I'm not sure I could do better in the next round, considering the decreasing value of the money."
