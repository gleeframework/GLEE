Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit one-sided.  Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more since the value decreases for me over time, but we can still make this work for both of us.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45, recognizing the value decrease for you.  This gives us both a decent share and avoids further rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
