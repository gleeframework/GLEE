"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (990,000) and only gives Bob a small portion (10,000).  I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of the money losing value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, it's better to accept this 50/50 split.  If I reject, the next round will reduce the value of the money further, and I might end up with less."
