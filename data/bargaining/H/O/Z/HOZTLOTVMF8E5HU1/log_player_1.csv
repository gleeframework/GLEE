"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  This gives me a large share of the money, but it leaves some for Bob, which may make him more likely to accept the offer.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it gives me a large gain in the short-term, I know the money loses value with each round.  If I wait, I can get a better deal in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $7,000 and Bob receives $3,000. I am reducing my share to try to reach a compromise, but I still believe I should get a larger portion. Let's see if this offer is more appealing to Bob."
