Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything!  Since I have the advantage of the inflation, I'll leave Bob with just a single dollar. 😉"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to keep fighting for more, the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to justify rejecting a 50/50 split.  I'll take the half a million and run! 🏃‍♀️"
