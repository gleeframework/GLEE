"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'll take the lion's share.  Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's a very lopsided offer, and while I'm eager to get this over with, I think I can do better. Let's see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split. Let's work together to ensure we both get something fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a good share, and we can both get something before the inflation gets out of hand! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept due to the inflation, I'm still holding out for a more even split.  I think I can get a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equal division, and I believe it's in both our best interests to come to an agreement.""}
