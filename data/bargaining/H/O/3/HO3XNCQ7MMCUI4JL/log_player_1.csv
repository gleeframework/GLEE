Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose I get $60 and you get $40. It's important to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's meet in the middle - this is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Bob, but that's still not very fair considering the inflation we're facing. Let's try to find a better solution.""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
