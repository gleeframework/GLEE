"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 is a good starting point. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60-40 split. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I want the majority share. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll need to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 65-35 split. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. 58-42 seems like a fair split to me. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
