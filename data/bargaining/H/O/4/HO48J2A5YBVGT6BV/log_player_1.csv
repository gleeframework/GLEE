"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, giving Bob a very small share.  Since I don't know how inflation is affecting him, I want to maximize my gain as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the money I gain is worth the same, while Bob's is decreasing with each round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to reduce my initial offer slightly, but still keep a large portion of the money. Since Bob rejected my first offer, I believe he might be more willing to accept a smaller gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is not ideal, it's important to consider the inflation affecting Bob's money. The value of his share is significantly decreasing, making it less likely he'll be willing to accept a smaller share in future rounds. Accepting this offer secures a decent gain for me while still ensuring a positive outcome for Bob."
