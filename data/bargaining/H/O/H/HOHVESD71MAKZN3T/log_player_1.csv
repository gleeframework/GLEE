I'll start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money, but still offers Bob a decent share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd like to hold out for more, the inflation factor is too significant. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, considering the shrinking value of the money."
