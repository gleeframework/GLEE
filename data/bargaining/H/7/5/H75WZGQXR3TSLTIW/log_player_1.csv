Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,

""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This is a better offer for you than the next round.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** Bob's potential gains decrease with each round due to inflation. This puts increasing pressure on him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Slight advantage:** I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome than a 50/50 split, recognizing that Bob is getting impatient.
* **Future projection:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely propose a 50/50 split in the next round, leaving him with even less due to inflation. My message subtly hints at this consequence."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share to compensate for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and his offers reflect that. He's severely undervaluing the impact of inflation.  I'm confident that if I hold out, he'll be forced to offer a much better deal in the next round to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - any more rounds and you'll lose out even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchor at fairness:** After rejecting Bob's increasingly lopsided offers, I'm returning to the fair and initially proposed 50/50 split. This makes my position appear strong and principled.
* **Deadline pressure:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating strong time pressure. Bob knows that further delays mean significant losses for him due to the accelerating inflation.
* **Strategic risk:** There's a risk Bob might call my bluff and let the game continue. However, I believe the potential losses outweigh any remaining hope he has of getting a better deal at this point. He's already lost over a third of his potential earnings to inflation."
