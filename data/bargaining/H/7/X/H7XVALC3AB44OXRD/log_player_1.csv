I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This gives me a significant share while still offering Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept.  Let's see if he's willing to play ball!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a more favorable split, this offer still gives me a decent amount of money. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob has already rejected my offer, it seems like a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least some money, whereas rejecting it risks getting nothing at all."
