"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fair, but in my favor this time. Let's see if you'll accept. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so fast, Bob!

I'll reject your offer. I'm not willing to give you a 60-40 split, even if it's in your favor this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
