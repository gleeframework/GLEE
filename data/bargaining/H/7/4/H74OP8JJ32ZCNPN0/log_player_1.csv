"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob! It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $5,000 and keeping $5,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less this round, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power. In this case, I'll get $4,000, which is equivalent to $5,000 in the first round. That's a decent amount!

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I'm not sure what Bob's next offer will be. If I accept, I'll be giving up the opportunity to negotiate further.

For now, I'll reject the offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $6,000 for himself and $4,000 for me, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to myself.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this round, but I'm still not giving away all the power!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for myself. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but I'm still trying to maintain a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'll still let you have some! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a bigger share each round!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer of $3,000 is equivalent to $3,846.15 in the first round, which is a significant amount. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much more to him.

Since my gain of $3,000 is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not feeling too pressured to accept this offer. I'll think carefully about it...

For now, I'll reject the offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $7,000 for himself and $3,000 for me, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to myself.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the power!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800 and keeping $4,200 for myself. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but I'm still trying to maintain a slight advantage."
