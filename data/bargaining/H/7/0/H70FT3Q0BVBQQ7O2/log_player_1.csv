"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping the majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less now, I'd rather not accept a deal that's even more skewed towards Bob. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to be even more careful with my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much."
