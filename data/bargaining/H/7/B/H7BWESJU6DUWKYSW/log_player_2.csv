"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Even though the offer is fair in terms of the nominal amount, the decreasing value of the money for me means I should try to negotiate for more.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round where I'll make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I need to take this into account when making my offer. In round 1, Alice offered a 50/50 split, but given the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.\n\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to make it fairer for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
