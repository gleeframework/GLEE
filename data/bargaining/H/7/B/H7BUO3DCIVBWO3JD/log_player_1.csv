"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. My message is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping to set a strong tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to be fair and split the money evenly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in splitting the money evenly, especially since I'm not sure how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value of the money. I'm hoping to negotiate for a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous with the even split, let's try a more realistic offer""
}
```

I'm reducing my offer to Bob, keeping $700,000 for myself and offering him $300,000. My message is a bit snarky, but I'm trying to convey that I'm not interested in giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get something back for myself too.  We both get a decent chunk this way, and we avoid risking further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to find a compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to give me a large enough share. I'm thinking that if he's willing to give me $600,000, he might be willing to give me more if I push him harder. I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle yet. Meet me at this price and we can wrap this up.""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to offer Bob, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. My message is a bit more assertive, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that $700,000 is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation. I'm hoping to get a better offer from Bob, so I'll reject this one and see what he comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging on the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to offer Bob slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. My message is a bit firm, but I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is getting desperate and wants to make a final compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that $750,000 is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation. I'm still hoping to get a better offer from Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for this compromise just yet. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to budge any further. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm making a very aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself and offering Bob only $100,000. My message is very direct and leaves little room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer or we'll both walk away with nothing."
