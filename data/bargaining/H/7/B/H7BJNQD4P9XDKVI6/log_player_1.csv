"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm showing good faith by offering Bob a significant share. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the one to make the first counteroffer! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's trying to negotiate a bit more, but I'm not impressed.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 4000 is a bit too low for me, considering I was willing to offer him 2000 in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now $9,000. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice. I think I deserve more considering the current devaluation of the money! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks he's being underpaid. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving Bob a larger share, especially considering he rejected my previous offer. I'll wait for another chance to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so it's now worth $7,272. The total amount is still $9,000, but its value has decreased due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split considering the current value of the money. Let's end this game!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept a reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not falling for the 'let's end the game' trick, Alice. I think I can do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob's not afraid to take a risk. The money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so it's now worth around $5,904.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with giving Bob a 60% share, especially since I was willing to offer him 3000 in round 2. I'll wait for another chance to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so it's now worth around $5,904. The total amount is still $9,000, but its value has decreased due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to let you take advantage of me, Bob. This is a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept a reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'm going to take advantage of your weakness and make a stronger offer! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks he's got the upper hand. The money is worth 52.17% less than in the first round, so it's now worth around $4,808.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to give in to Bob's aggressive tactics. 3500 is still a relatively small share, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small amount. I'll keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 52.17% less than in the first round, so it's now worth around $4,808. The total amount is still $9,000, but its value has decreased due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not afraid to tie, Bob. Let's call it a draw and split the remaining amount evenly.""
}
```

It's time to take a risk and see if Bob will accept a 50/50 split."
