"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only $1! Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $10 and keeping $90 for myself. I think this is a fair offer given that I'm taking the risk of rejection and potentially losing out on a larger share due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with this offer.  While it's better than the first round, I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Alice to $30, while still keeping a larger share for myself.  This is a fair compromise given the inflation factor and the fact that we're both losing money with each round.  I hope she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not convinced by this offer. It's better than previous rounds, but I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal. I'm hoping Alice realizes that she's running out of time and will offer a more favorable split soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm going to try one more time to negotiate a fair deal. I'm offering Alice $40, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair split considering the inflation factor and the limited time remaining.  I hope she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but with the inflation, I'm worried that I won't get anything if we keep going. This offer is decent, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. I'll accept."
