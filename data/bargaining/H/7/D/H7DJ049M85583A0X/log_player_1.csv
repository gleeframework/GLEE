# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm still aiming for a more even split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more to ensure that we don't run out of time.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in reaching an agreement now, as the inflation is starting to take effect."

I'm making a final push for a more equitable split.  I'm willing to concede a little more, but I'm not going to give up on getting a fair share of the money.  We're running out of time, and I'm hoping that Bob sees the sense in accepting this offer."
