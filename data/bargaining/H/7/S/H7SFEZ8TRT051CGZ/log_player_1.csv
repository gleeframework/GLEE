This offer heavily favors Alice, as it should in the first round. There's a strong incentive for Bob to take any reasonable offer because his share will be worth significantly less with each round that passes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better deal for both of us. This is my first offer, and I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Let's break down why rejecting is the right move here:

* **Power Shift:** While Bob's offer is framed as generous, the inflation heavily favors Alice as the game progresses. Each round Bob delays, his potential share decreases in value. 
* **Early Pressure:**  Accepting a low offer early sets a bad precedent. Bob might be more willing to negotiate a fairer deal if he knows Alice won't settle for scraps.
* **Future Leverage:** By round 3, even if Bob offers a 50/50 split, the actual value he's offering will be significantly less than what Alice could secure by waiting. 

Alice holds a strong position due to the inflation mechanic.  It's in her best interest to leverage this advantage for a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a fair resolution.  Let's consider the time value and settle this round.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Significant Increase:**  Alice raises her demand significantly from the initial offer, reflecting her stronger position due to inflation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message emphasizes ""fair resolution"" and ""time value"" to subtly remind Bob about the shrinking pot from his perspective.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While the offer is still heavily in Alice's favor, it provides some leeway for Bob to counter-offer without a drastic reduction in Alice's potential gain. 

This offer balances assertiveness with a touch of compromise to encourage Bob toward a deal while maximizing Alice's potential gains."
