Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but your last offer was too generous towards you. I propose 60/40 split,  which considers the inflation but also ensures a fairer distribution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
