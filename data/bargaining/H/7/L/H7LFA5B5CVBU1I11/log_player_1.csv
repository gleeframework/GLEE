Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to justify taking the risk of moving forward. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
