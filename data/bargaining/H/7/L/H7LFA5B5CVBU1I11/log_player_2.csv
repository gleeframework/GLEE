"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if Alice will be willing to negotiate.  There's a lot of money at stake here and I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to justify taking the risk of moving forward.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the deal is getting worse for both of us.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a slightly larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing. It's a fair and reasonable solution considering the time constraint and the dwindling value of the money."
