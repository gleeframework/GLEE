"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, aiming for a quick win.  900,000$ is a large sum, and Bob might be tempted to accept it rather than risk losing more in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures a significant gain of $500,000.  The risk of rejection in the next round and potential loss due to inflation makes this a good deal."
