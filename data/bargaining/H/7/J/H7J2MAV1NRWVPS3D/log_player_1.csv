"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a fair start""
}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is more fair, considering we both have equal say in this. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $500,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is actually worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $667,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 6:4 split, but I do appreciate Bob's willingness to be reasonable. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
