Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. This way I'll get a decent chunk, but you'll still get a third of the money. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
