"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, giving him 10% of the money.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a fair deal early on, or if he's going to be greedy and risk losing out as the rounds go by."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, considering the inflation. Even with the 5% loss, I'm still getting a much better deal if I wait and make my own offer in the next round.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer than before, but I'm still offering Bob a decent chunk of the money. I need to make sure that he knows I'm not afraid to take a larger share, but also that I'm willing to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low, even considering the inflation. I'm not going to settle for anything less than a much larger share. I'll take my chances and make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 850,000 for myself, hoping that Bob will see that I'm not going to cave to his demands. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob is now offering an even split, I'm still not happy with the deal.  The inflation has eroded the value of my share significantly, and I'm confident that I can still get a better deal if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going back to my original offer.  I'm willing to give Bob 10%, but I'm not going to give him more. The inflation is getting serious, and I need to start securing a larger share. I'm hoping he'll see the value of accepting this offer before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, considering the amount of inflation we've experienced. I'm not going to settle for less than 60% of the remaining money.  I'm confident that I can still get a better deal if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm taking a risk here and offering Bob only 50,000. The inflation is seriously hurting the value of the money, and I need to secure a large share for myself.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that he's running out of time and will accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, considering the amount of inflation we've experienced. I'm not going to settle for less than 60% of the remaining money. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal if I keep playing.  I'm starting to get nervous about the time running out, but I won't let Bob take advantage of me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 975000, ""bob_gain"": 25000}
```

I'm going for a very aggressive offer, offering Bob only 25,000.  We're running out of time, and I need to secure a large portion of the money for myself. It's a gamble, but with only two rounds left, I believe this is the best way to maximize my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a tough decision, but I have to accept Bob's offer. The inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, and with only one round left, there's a real chance we'll both get nothing. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing at all. I'll take the 575,000 and be happy to walk away with something."
