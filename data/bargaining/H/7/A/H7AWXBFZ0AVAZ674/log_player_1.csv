Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob thinks that's fair.  I want to get the majority, but I'm not sure how much Bob values the money.  I'll see if I can get him to accept a deal that benefits me more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees I get something.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  Let's see how the rest of the game plays out."
