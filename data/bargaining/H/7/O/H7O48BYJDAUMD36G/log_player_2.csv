# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust if needed in the next round.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's go with a 50/50 split. It's fair considering the inflation and gives us both a decent return. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair, and the inflation is starting to hurt. Let's take it!"
