# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right to point out the time pressure, we're still in the early rounds.  Alice is clearly aiming to take advantage of my shrinking pot.  Holding out a bit longer might make her realize I'm serious about getting a better share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is the most straightforward and fair deal.  We both know I can't accept anything less with the inflation, and we risk getting nothing if this drags on.""}
