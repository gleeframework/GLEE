Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is it, my final stand.  I'm offering Bob the bare minimum, but it's better than nothing.  If he rejects this, he'll be responsible for both of us losing even more money.  He's already proven to be incredibly stubborn, but hopefully, he'll finally see reason."
