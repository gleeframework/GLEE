**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to wear me down with increasingly bad offers, hoping I'll panic as the rounds go on. It's a classic negotiation tactic, but I'm not going to fall for it.  I'll hold out for a better deal, even with the inflation pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real.  We both lose if this goes on. I'm offering a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to put my foot down. Offering a 50/50 split is fair and sends a clear message that I'm not budging further.  The increasing inflation means every round wasted hurts us both.  It's in Alice's best interest to accept this, even if she's hoping for more."
