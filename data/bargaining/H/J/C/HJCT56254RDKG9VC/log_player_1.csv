Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, since we both lose value with each round. Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor this round, and we can see where things go from there. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
