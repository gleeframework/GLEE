"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we have 11 more rounds to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
