"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not a fair split at all! I'm willing to be generous, but let's be realistic.  I propose 65% for me and 35% for you. It's a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
