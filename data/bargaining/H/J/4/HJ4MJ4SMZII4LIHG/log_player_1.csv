Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering inflation hits you harder 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, my friend, time is running out! Let's settle this now. This offer considers the changing value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on my side, I'll take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, accepting only $4,000 after inflation is significantly less than even the previous offer. I need to hold out for a better deal in the next round, as Bob's position will become less advantageous as inflation continues to affect him."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is a fair split considering the circumstances.  Any longer and we both lose out significantly."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming severe. While ideally, I want more, a 50/50 split is the most logical offer at this point. It guarantees a reasonable amount for both of us before inflation erodes the value further. Bob is likely realizing the same thing, making him more inclined to accept a fair deal."
