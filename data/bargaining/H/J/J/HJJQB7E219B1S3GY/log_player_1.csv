"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation in later rounds.  Let's get this done!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred my original offer, it is wise to accept this offer before inflation erodes the value of the money further.  A 50/50 split is fair and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount."
