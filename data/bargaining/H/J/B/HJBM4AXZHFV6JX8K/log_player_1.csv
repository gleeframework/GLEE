"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping Bob will see the value in getting *something* rather than risking getting nothing if we go through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing at all in the next rounds with inflation."
