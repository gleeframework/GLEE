60.0,40.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'll take the bigger share since I made the first offer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
49.0,51.0,"I think 51-49 is a fair split, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer.  Let's see if you're willing to be a little more reasonable.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"I see you're willing to negotiate, but 51-49 is still not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,I'm sticking to my guns.  I think 55-45 is a fair split considering the inflation affecting your share.  Let's get this deal done.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"I see you're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not desperate yet. How about 56-44 and we call it a day?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm taking a bold step here.  Inflation is making your share worth less and less, so I think a 60-40 split is the most fair deal we can make right now.  Let's end this game before it goes any further.",Bob,6,
