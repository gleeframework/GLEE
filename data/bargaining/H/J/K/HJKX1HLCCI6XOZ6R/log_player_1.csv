"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script and go for a 60-40 split in my favor. It's only fair that I get more since I'm the one making the offer this round. ðŸ˜‰ 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob is making the offer this round, I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly due to inflation.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob's proposal is the best one. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll aim to make a proposal that's a bit more balanced. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 55-45. It's a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45. I hope this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
