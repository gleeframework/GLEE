"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

 I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation and the fact that I am the one initiating the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000} 
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation that has already occurred and the fact that I will be the one to make the next offer if it's rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is less than what I initially proposed, it's still better than risking further inflation and ending up with even less in the next round."
