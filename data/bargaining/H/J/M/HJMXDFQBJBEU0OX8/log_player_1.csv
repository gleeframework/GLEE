"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value. 

The offer is to split the money evenly, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
