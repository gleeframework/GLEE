"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we split the money fairly and avoid unnecessary negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $2,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $8,000 is worth 80% of its original value.

I'm not convinced that I deserve to take only $2,000, especially considering Bob's message that he thinks he deserves more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm offering to take $5,500 and leave $4,500 for Bob, hoping that this compromise will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 51.2% of its original value.

I'm surprised that Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which is a significant concession. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this is a fair offer. I'll accept it.
