600000.0,400000.0,"Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a good deal for you to get something now rather than risking it all in later rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Your 60/40 split was a bit too greedy, Alice. I'm proposing a more balanced 52.5/47.5 split in my favor. Take it while it's still a good deal, because inflation is eating away at our potential earnings!",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I appreciate your attempt at balance, Bob, but I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This offer keeps in mind that we both lose if this drags on.",Alice,3,

487500.0,512500.0,"Alice, we're getting close, but your offer still favors you too much. I'm proposing a 51.25/48.75 split, a slight concession on my end. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses from inflation!",Bob,4,

530000.0,470000.0,"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  53/47 seems like a fair compromise.  We're getting dangerously close to losing significant amounts to inflation if we don't agree soon.",Alice,5,

493750.0,506250.0,"Alice, I'm holding firm. This offer is a 50.625/49.375 split, a tiny concession on my part, showing my willingness to compromise.  Let's be realistic, every round is costing us serious money. Don't let greed win, agree to this fair deal!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
515000.0,485000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but time is working against us. I'm offering 51.5/48.5.  It's a slight move on my side, reflecting the urgency of the situation. Let's end this before inflation eats away any more of our potential winnings.",Alice,7,
