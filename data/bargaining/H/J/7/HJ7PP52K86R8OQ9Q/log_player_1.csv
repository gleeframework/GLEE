"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and give Bob 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut decreases each round with inflation. Let's meet in the middle for a quick deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. The inflation effect is significant, but I think I can still get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer, taking into account the inflation effect, but I still think I should get a larger share. Let's see how Bob responds to this new proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and the deal is getting worse for you every round.  This is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a fair offer yet. While the inflation effect is increasingly significant, I think Bob is still trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can still squeeze out a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's end this soon.""
}
```

I've reduced my offer again, taking into account the increasing inflation effect. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm making an effort to compromise and accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this now, or we both lose out! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll try to make a more attractive offer in the next round.```

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""bob_gain"": 470000,
  ""message"": ""I know time is running out, but I'm not desperate yet. Meet me here and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```

I'm still trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I've reduced my offer again, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm still willing to compromise and accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we're running out of time! 
# Alice gain: 495000 
# Bob gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","{ ""decision"": ""accept"" } 

I think it's time to accept the offer. The inflation effect is significant, and I've pushed Bob as far as I can. This offer is close enough to 50-50 that I'm willing to accept it and end the game. Continuing to negotiate might result in me losing out on even more value."
