Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50/50, can't get fairer than that 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's tempting to hold out for a slightly better deal, but with the increasing inflation, accepting a 50/50 split now is the most logical choice.  Any further delays risk significantly diminishing returns."
