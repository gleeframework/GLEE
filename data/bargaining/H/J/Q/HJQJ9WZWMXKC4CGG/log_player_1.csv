I propose to take 900,000 dollars and leave 100,000 dollars for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob something while ensuring I get the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair. While my gain is worth 10% less than the previous round, his gain is worth 20% less. I'm not going to accept this offer. I'm going to counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed gain by 100,000 dollars to 800,000. This is still a fair offer considering the inflation, and it's a substantial amount for Bob. Hopefully, he'll see reason and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than the last one! My gain is even lower, and his is still quite high despite the inflation. I'm not giving up that easily. I need to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm getting tired of Bob's greed.  I'm lowering my proposed gain to 700,000 dollars, and giving Bob 300,000 dollars. This is a significant share for him, considering how much the money has lost its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly unreasonable. While I'm taking a big hit from inflation, his gain is still relatively high considering the value has dropped so significantly. I won't accept this offer, and I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm starting to get desperate. The money is losing value rapidly, and if we don't come to an agreement soon, we'll both get nothing.  I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a lot considering the inflation, hoping he'll finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly stubborn.  His offer is still way too unbalanced considering the inflation.  I'm going to make a final attempt to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're running out of time, and I'm feeling the pressure. I'm proposing an even split of 500,000 dollars each.  This seems like the fairest solution given the inflation, and it's our only chance to get something.  Let's hope Bob sees reason."
