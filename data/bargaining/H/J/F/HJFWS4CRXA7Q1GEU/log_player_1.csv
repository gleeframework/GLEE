Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, and I need a bigger share to secure my future. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob is getting a bigger share, the inflation has eaten away a significant amount of the money, making this a more reasonable offer than the previous ones. Accepting ensures some gain and avoids further potential loss from inflation."
