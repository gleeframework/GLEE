Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Since Alice's offer is still a bit skewed towards her, I'll try to push for a more even split.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is taking a toll, and the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the reduced value.
