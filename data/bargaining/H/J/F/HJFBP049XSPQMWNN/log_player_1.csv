# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50. It's a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both 5,000 each. This way, we can both get a decent amount of money and avoid any further negotiations."
