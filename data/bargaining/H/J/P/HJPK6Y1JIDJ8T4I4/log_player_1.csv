"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 7:3, a fair and reasonable start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly and reasonable proposal, hoping to set a good tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too greedy, now it's my turn to take a bigger slice 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is taking a more aggressive approach now.

I'll consider the new offer and the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll think about the relative value of the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60:40 split, especially since the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55:45 split, trying to find a more reasonable middle ground. The message is a friendly reminder that I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's be fair and finish this 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be more conciliatory now.

Considering the effects of inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

My gain of $500,000 is worth 85.74% of the original $700,000 I would have gained in Round 1, due to the 14.26% decrease in value.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like a fair split, considering the effects of inflation, and I'm willing to end the game here."
