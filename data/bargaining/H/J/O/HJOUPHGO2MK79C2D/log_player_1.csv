I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping to maximize my gain in the first round. I'll see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more,  accepting this offer is the best option.  If I reject, I risk further rounds and potentially getting nothing at all.  With Bob's offer, I'm still securing a significant portion of the money."
