"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-offer. While her proposal factors in inflation, it heavily favors her.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such a disadvantaged starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Your initial offer was heavily skewed considering the inflation.  This is a more realistic starting point for negotiations.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I've adjusted my offer. This should be more reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is barely budging! Her offer is only slightly better, and the rapid devaluation of her share is not reflected in her proposals. We need to push for a more significant shift in our favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offers are not reflecting the reality of the situation. The value diminishes rapidly for you with each round.  Let's be reasonable and find a compromise.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm not ready to give up a larger share yet. Let's meet closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous! Alice is acknowledging the inflation but not adjusting her offer nearly enough. It seems like she's hoping I'll panic as we approach the deadline and accept a bad deal. Let's see if we can give her a wake-up call."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Your share is practically worthless at this point, yet you cling to a disproportionate amount.  Accept a realistic deal, or we both lose!""
