I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This feels fair given that we are both starting out and I have a slight advantage due to the inflation affecting me.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I understand the inflation is working against me, a 3000/7000 split is too unfavorable. I'd rather take the risk and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split in Bob's favor.  Since I'm facing inflation, I need to offer him a bit more to incentivize him to accept.  This is still a better deal for me than the 3000/7000 split he offered, and I hope it's enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share, this offer is the best I'm likely to get.  I'll accept and move on."
