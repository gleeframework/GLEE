"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 400,000 is a decent starting point, I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 65-35 in my favor.  It's a fair offer considering the inflation we'll both be facing in the coming rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle, 57-43 is a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a 65-35 split, I don't want to risk losing everything. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money."
