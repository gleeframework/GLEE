"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's be a little more equitable this round. How about a 55/45 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and the value decreases with each round. I'm proposing 5800 for me and 4200 for you. It's a better deal than you'll get in round 4. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is slightly better than the previous round for me. More importantly, if I reject this offer and go to round 4, Alice's value for the money will decrease further, making it likely she'll offer me even less. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even if it's not a perfect split."
