"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 30% to start. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. 30% is too low, and I know Alice's money is losing value much faster than mine.  I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly. Let's go with 60 for me and 40 for you. This is a fair starting point, and we can both still come out ahead.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is dropping fast.  I'm coming down to 65, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, time is running out and the value of the money is dropping rapidly.  Alice's offer is fair, considering the inflation, and I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing at all."
