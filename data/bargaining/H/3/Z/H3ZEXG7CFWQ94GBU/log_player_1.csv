"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping to get a good deal early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $190,000. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $800,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $640,000.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still hoping for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain of $400,000 is worth 59.52% of the original $1,000,000, which is approximately $596,000.
Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 60% of the original $1,000,000, which is $600,000.

This offer is actually a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather take it than risk waiting for a better offer.
