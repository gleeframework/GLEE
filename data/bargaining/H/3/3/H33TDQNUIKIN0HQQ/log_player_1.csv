"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation rate is low in the first round.""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, which seems reasonable considering the low inflation rate in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a slightly more even split, keeping in mind the inflation that will affect our future gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I'd like to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate is higher in this round, I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split to account for the decreased value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on an even split, but I think I should get a slight edge due to the increased inflation.""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this proposal."
