Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 5500/4500, and avoid the inflation penalty. This way we both get a decent share, and we don't have to risk losing more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
