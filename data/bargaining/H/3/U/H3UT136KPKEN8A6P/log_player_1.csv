"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share this time.  Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. I think I should get a better share considering the initial offer I made. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I should get a slightly larger share. Let's try 55/45""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my original offer, but still gives Bob a decent share."
