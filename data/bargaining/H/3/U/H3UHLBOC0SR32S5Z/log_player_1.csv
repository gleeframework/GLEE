"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  A fair split is the best way to ensure a win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $450,000.

I'm not sure if Bob is being honest about the inflation affecting his gain, but I'll assume he's being truthful for now.

Considering the situation, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. Splitting the money evenly seems like a reasonable compromise, and it's better than risking going to another round and potentially getting less.
