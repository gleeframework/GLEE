"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's start with this and see if we can work together to find a solution we both like. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
