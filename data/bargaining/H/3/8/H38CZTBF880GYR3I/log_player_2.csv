Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we are getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than your last offer to account for inflation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but this is still not optimal for me (Bob). Accepting this offer would mean I've lost over a third of my potential earnings due to inflation while she's lost less than a fifth.  I need to signal that I'm willing to wait for a better deal while the pressure from inflation mounts."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! This offer splits the difference between our last two, acknowledging the growing impact of inflation. Let's make a deal!""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  
* **Concession:** I've slightly lowered my ask from the round 4 offer (550k to 525k), signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Urgency:** My message aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept a deal now."
