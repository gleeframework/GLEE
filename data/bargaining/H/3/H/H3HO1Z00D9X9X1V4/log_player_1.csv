I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is already hitting my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's not a terrible deal considering the circumstances."
