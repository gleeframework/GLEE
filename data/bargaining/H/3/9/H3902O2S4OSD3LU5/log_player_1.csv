"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can see how the game plays out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting $40, which is a decent amount. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 60% share, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55% and decreasing Bob's share to 45%, trying to find a middle ground. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate being 48.8% less for Bob, his offer is actually a good one for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing for him. I'll accept this offer.
