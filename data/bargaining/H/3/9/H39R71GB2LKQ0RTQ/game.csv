6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly, Bob.  I get $6000, you get $4000. It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, your initial offer was a bit too tilted in your favor. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55/45 split.  This accounts for the inflation while still being a fair deal.",Bob,2,
,,"That's still a bit heavily weighted towards you, Bob.  The inflation is hitting me harder than you think! How about we try to find a compromise in the next round?",Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Okay Bob, let's compromise. I'll come down a bit from my previous offer. How about a 52/48 split? That accounts for the inflation impacting me while still giving us both a decent share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you coming down a bit.  Let's settle this - I propose a 58/42 split.  It's a strong offer considering the time pressure and the inflation working against you.",Bob,4,
,,"This is still too imbalanced for me, Bob. The inflation is really eating into my share, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's try to wrap this up quickly in the next round.",Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly down the middle - 50/50.  It's the fairest option, and we don't want to risk running out of time with this inflation!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
