"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round. I figure Bob is likely to reject it, but it sets a precedent that I'm willing to be aggressive.  Plus, I'm hoping he'll be swayed by the fact that he gets something, even if it's very small, and that he'll be willing to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement for him, but it's still far too generous.  I'm going to reject and see if he's willing to negotiate further.  I'm still holding out for a much larger share, and I'm confident that I can get it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a significantly smaller reduction from my previous offer. I'm aiming to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still expecting a much larger share of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough. I'm sticking to my guns and hoping he'll come around.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to continue to decrease my offer, but I'm still keeping it high.  I'm hoping that Bob is starting to get a sense of urgency, and he'll be willing to accept a less favorable deal rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 352000 
# Bob gain: 648000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is improving, but I'm still holding out for a larger share.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to do so. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm not going to cave just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to continue lowering my offer, but still keeping it above 50%. Inflation is starting to take a bigger bite, and Bob seems determined to get a larger share. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to tempt him, but I'm ready to keep playing if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 409515 
# Bob gain: 590485 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really starting to hurt now, and I'm worried about the risk of getting nothing at all. Bob's offer isn't ideal, but it's the best I can expect given the circumstances.  I'm going to accept it and walk away with something, rather than risk losing everything."
