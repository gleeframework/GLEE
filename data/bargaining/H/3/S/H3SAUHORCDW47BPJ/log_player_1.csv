"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. I've also included a friendly message to try to persuade Bob to accept the offer.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, given the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I will respond to Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round, despite the inflation. The difference in the devaluation of money between us (10% for me and 5% for Bob) might give me some leverage in future rounds.\n\nYour turn! What happens next?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I will make a new offer to Bob.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's compromise!""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer, while also taking into account the inflation. I've reduced my gain by 2 dollars compared to the initial offer, and increased Bob's gain by 2 dollars compared to the previous round.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  It's getting risky to keep going! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I'm playing as Alice, I will respond to Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the increasing inflation, I think it's a relatively fair split at this point. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, and the risk of losing more value to inflation in future rounds is getting higher.\n\nYour turn! What happens next?"
