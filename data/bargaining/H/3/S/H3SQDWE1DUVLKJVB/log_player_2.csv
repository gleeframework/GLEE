Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:** Even though the offer is a 50/50 split, it's important to consider the inflation. My gain is worth 19% less than the first round, while Alice's is only 9.75% less. This means that a 50/50 split in this round is actually a better deal for me than a 50/50 split in the first round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Alice will reject this offer and we'll go into another round. However, the inflation is working against me, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round. 

Accepting the offer secures a decent amount of money, even with the inflation, and minimizes the risk of getting a worse deal later."
