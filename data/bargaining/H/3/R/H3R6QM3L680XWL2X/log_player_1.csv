"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, but still favorable to me. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Since the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better if we split it more evenly. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal, even considering the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise as the rounds progress. Additionally, accepting an offer of 45% of the money seems too low, especially since I started with a more generous offer of 40% for Bob. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 42% of the money, which is a slight concession from my original offer, but still favorable to me. The message ""Meet me in the middle?"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and encourage him to accept the offer. Since the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further losses. By meeting in the middle, we can both avoid the effects of inflation and walk away with a reasonable amount of money."
