"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 2/3 is a fair ratio. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd rather negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to proceed to the next round and see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 2/3, I'll try to push for a more equal split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I think 55-45 is a more balanced split, what do you think?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less than before, so I'm getting more desperate. But a 50/50 split is a good opportunity to get a decent amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50/50 split, it's a fair deal considering the circumstances!"
