I'm starting with a fair offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, but I'm not going to give in yet.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my offer to see if I can sway Bob.  Hopefully, he'll realize that  continuing to reject offers will only hurt him more in the long run."
