"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1 in favor of Alice. This should give us a good balance before considering inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 4:6 is a fairer split. Let's try this and see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
