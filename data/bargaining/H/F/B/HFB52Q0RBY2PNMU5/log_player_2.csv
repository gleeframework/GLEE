Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to a 60/40 split.  While she is slowly coming down, the rate of compromise is too slow. We need to push her further and see if we can get closer to a 50/50 split before inflation significantly erodes the value."
