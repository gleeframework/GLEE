"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair and balanced start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, and split it closer to even. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 45-55 split, as it's still a bit too skewed towards Bob. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to get closer to even""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a 52-48 split. This is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer, but still relatively close to an even split. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
