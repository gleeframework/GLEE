"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a good deal and avoid losing any money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I'll get 500,000, which is worth 95% of the original 700,000 I was initially hoping for, and Bob will get 500,000, which is worth 90% of the original 600,000 he was initially hoping for.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the remaining value, and Bob will get 45%."
