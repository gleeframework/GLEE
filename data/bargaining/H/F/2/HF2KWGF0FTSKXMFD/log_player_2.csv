"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's be friends 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is not as fair as it seems. While it seems like a fair share right now, Alice benefits significantly from the inflation.  By rejecting, Bob can propose a more equitable deal for himself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a good share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've compromised, take it before I change my mind 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice has already proven willing to negotiate, and the inflation is starting to impact her more significantly. This offer is close to what I initially wanted, and it's better than risking further rounds where inflation could further reduce Alice's potential gains, possibly making her less willing to compromise."
