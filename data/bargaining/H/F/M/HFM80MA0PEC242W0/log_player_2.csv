Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This back and forth isn't helping either of us. I propose an even split - 50/50.  It's the fairest option and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at this any further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
