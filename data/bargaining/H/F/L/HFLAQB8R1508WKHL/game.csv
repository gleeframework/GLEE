650000.0,350000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that time is of the essence due to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the inflation rates, I believe this split is more reasonable. Every round we delay, I lose 5% and you lose 20%. Let's settle this quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, but your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is my counter-offer. It's important to find a balance.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on your gains, I've adjusted my offer. Each round you delay costs you more than it costs me. I believe this split is fair given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a simple even split to end this.  It's clear we're not going to agree on anything else, and every round is costing us both money.",Alice,5,
