Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a starting point. What do you think?

# Alice gain: 600000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, your starting point heavily favors you.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money with inflation impacting me at twice your rate.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation.  How about a compromise - 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you? This takes into account the time factor while still acknowledging my initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
