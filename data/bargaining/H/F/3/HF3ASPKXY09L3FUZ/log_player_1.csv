"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still being fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a bigger share, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too generous for him, I'll try to make a counter-offer that's a bit more balanced. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""A slightly more balanced split, considering the inflation""}

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is still a bit more in my favor, but not as extreme as Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to find a balance between my gain and Alice's gain 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on Bob's gains! With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After some consideration, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 48/52 split, especially since Bob's gain is still worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was still a bit too generous for him, I'll try to make another counter-offer that's a bit more balanced. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation's impact on Bob's gain""}

I'm offering a 52/48 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still acknowledges the impact of inflation on Bob's gain. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
