Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We need to find a way to split the money fairly, considering the inflation.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, Alice's offer seems reasonable at this point. With the money being worth 18.55% less for me and 34.39% less for Alice compared to the first round, accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. It's time to finalize the deal!"
