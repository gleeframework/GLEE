"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can move on to the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can start negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Accept this and we can end the game now! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $8,000 if I accept this offer. But for Bob, his $5,000 is worth 10% less than the $2,000 he could have gotten in the first round, and 50% less than the $10,000 he could have gotten if he had accepted my first offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 50/50, I'll try to increase my share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a smaller share this time, but it's still a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a smaller share than last time, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $8,000 if I accept this offer. But for Bob, his $7,500 is worth 27.1% less than the $10,000 he could have gotten in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offers are getting smaller and smaller. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! Take this deal while you can!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a smaller share than last time, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up without a fight! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $8,000 if I accept this offer. But for Bob, his $8,000 is worth 40.95% less than the $10,000 he could have gotten in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

However, I'm starting to get worried that Bob's offers are getting smaller and smaller, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a small share in the end. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! This is my best offer so far!""
}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal next round 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting crazy low! Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $8,000 if I accept this offer. But for Bob, his $9,000 is worth 52.17% less than the $10,000 he could have gotten in the first round, which is an enormous reduction.

However, I'm getting worried that if I reject this offer, Bob might make an even lower offer next round, and I might be stuck with a tiny share. I'll take the risk and accept this offer.
