"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather not accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly skewed split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger hit, I'm not sure if this offer is the best I can get. However, it's still a decent split. I'll accept this offer:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
