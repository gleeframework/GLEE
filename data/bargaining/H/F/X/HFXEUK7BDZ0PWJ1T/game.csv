60.0,40.0,Let's split the money. I propose a 60/40 division in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation working against me.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation rate is higher for you, I think 55/45 is a fair division.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation difference. However, I'm still willing to take a slightly larger hit to end this quickly.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60/40. It's a deal that benefits us both in the long run.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Given the increasing inflation, especially on your end, I think it's reasonable to adjust the split to 58/42. This way, we both still get a decent amount, considering the value decrease.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
59.0,41.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my ask slightly again to show I'm willing to compromise.  59/41 - let's close this out and avoid further losses.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on your end, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is now a fair reflection of the current situation. Further delays will only worsen the value for both of us.",Bob,6,
