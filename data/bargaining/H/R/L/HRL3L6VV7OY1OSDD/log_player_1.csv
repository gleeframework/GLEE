"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth more to me in the early rounds, while also attempting to appear reasonable to Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate fairness, but the split needs to be more balanced considering the inflation. This offer accounts for that. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he's trying to justify it by mentioning inflation, the split is now in his favor, and I'm not convinced that it's fair considering the initial amount and the impact of inflation on both of us. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground that suits both of us.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $480,000 and taking $520,000 for myself. Given that the money's value is decreasing for both of us, but more significantly for Bob, I'm trying to find a balance that acknowledges this disparity while still aiming for a relatively fair split. My message conveys a willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution."
