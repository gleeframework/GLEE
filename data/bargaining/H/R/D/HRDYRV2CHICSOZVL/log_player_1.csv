"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amount I'll gain from the offer:

```
Actual Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, since it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
