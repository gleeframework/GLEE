"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation affects me more. A 40/60 split is more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
