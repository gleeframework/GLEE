I'm going to start with a pretty fair offer, keeping in mind the inflation factor. I'll take 9000 and leave 1000 for Bob. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to have more, the inflation factor is working against me. If I reject this offer, the money I'll gain in the next round will be the same, while Bob's offer will be worth less. It's better to take the 6000 now than risk getting less later."
