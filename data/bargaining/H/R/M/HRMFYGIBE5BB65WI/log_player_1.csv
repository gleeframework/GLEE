Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  Since the money depreciates faster for Bob, I'm hoping he'll take a small share now rather than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to get more, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing later. Bob is likely to propose an even more unfair split in the next round as the money loses value faster for him."
