"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal before accepting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split, considering I'm the one losing value over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more than 4500 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal, despite the decreasing value of the money for me. Given the impact of inflation, I'm actually getting less in real value than what the numbers suggest, so I need to push for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm actually getting less value, so I need a larger share to compensate for the loss over time. Let's adjust accordingly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hurting you, but I also need a fair share. Let's split this evenly for now and see how the next few rounds go. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action. Even though the nominal value is 5000, due to the 59.04% decrease in value, I'm actually getting less in real terms. However, further rounds will only continue to decrease the value for me, potentially leading to an even worse outcome. Accepting this offer now at least guarantees some value, rather than risking further loss."
