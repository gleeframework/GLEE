"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'd rather not give up 1000$ compared to the initial proposal, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
