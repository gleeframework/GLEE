{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a better deal""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better split, with me getting 45% and Bob getting 55%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm already feeling the pinch. A 30/70 split is way too unfair, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Oh no, this is getting dire! With the money worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm really feeling the pinch. A 15/85 split is absolutely unacceptable. I'm not going to accept this offer, even if Bob is getting desperate. I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going."

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Oh no, this is getting really tough! With the money worth 52.17% less than in the first round, I'm really struggling. A 10/90 split is almost unbearable. I'm not going to accept this offer, even if Bob is getting close to taking what he can get. I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going."

I'm not going to hold out any longer. I'm accepting the fact that the money is worth much less than it was initially, and I'm willing to give up my share to Bob. I'm hoping that Bob will be satisfied with this offer and we can finally end the game."
