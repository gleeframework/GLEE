"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the initial amount. I'm taking the remaining 90%. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split this time 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a more balanced split. However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the current amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% less than in the first round now. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can both get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the current amount. I'm framing it as a ""meeting in the middle"" to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up all the power 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a bit more generous than my previous one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $450,000 and call it a day."
