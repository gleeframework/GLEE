Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here. We're both losing value with each round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's avoid further losses and settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
