This offer gives me 90% of the money and Bob only 10%. It's a very lopsided offer, but I'm hoping to get this over with quickly in the first round."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a split closer to 60/40 in my favor. This is a more reasonable offer than my first attempt and I hope it's enough to convince Bob to accept.  While I'm still getting the bigger share, I'm willing to compromise a little more to avoid further inflation."

The inflation is really hurting, but I'm still trying to hold on to as much as possible.  I'm willing to concede a little more to Bob, offering a 40/60 split in his favor.  This is the best I can do without completely losing out."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, and the inflation is taking a huge toll.  I'm still holding out hope, but I'm starting to feel like I might have to accept something unfavorable to avoid getting nothing at all.  I'll reject this offer and try to make a counter-proposal in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

I'm offering a 30/70 split in Bob's favor.  We are getting very close to the end of the game and the inflation is brutal.  I have to give up more, but I hope Bob will take this offer to avoid further inflation.  I'm hoping he recognizes that at this point, even a small amount is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  The inflation has been so bad that the money I'm getting is significantly less than I'd hoped for.  But it's better than nothing.  I'll accept the offer,  I'm not sure if I can hold out for a better deal with only two rounds left."
