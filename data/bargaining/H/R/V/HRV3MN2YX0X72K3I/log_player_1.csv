"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we're done!""
}
```

This is a pretty straightforward offer - I'm proposing that I get all $100, and Bob gets nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair starting point, let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially since the money is worth less for Bob than for me. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split, even though it's a bit better than my previous offer. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied""
}
```

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think we've reached a good agreement, and I'm willing to split the remaining money evenly with Bob."
