"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to reverse the split I proposed!

Considering the inflation, the effective value of the money is decreasing, so I'd like to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, I'd like to propose a 55-45 split instead""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider my revised proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get a decent share to make up for the lost value""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55.5-44.5 in my favor, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
