Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get a decent share to make up for the lost value 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic move. 

* **Inflation:**  We're both losing value with each round, and the next round will see a further decrease.
* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and has increased her offer slightly.
* **Potential for a Deal:**  Rejecting again risks Alice becoming less willing to compromise in the future.

It's better to secure a decent share now than risk losing even more value in future rounds."
