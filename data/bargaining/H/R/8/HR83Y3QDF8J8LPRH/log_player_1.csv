"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. Since Bob doesn't lose any value due to inflation, I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept this offer and we can both walk away with a decent amount. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. If he rejects it, I'll be happy to proceed to the next round and make a new proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think this split is more reflective of the situation.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'd actually be getting less value than the $400,000 offered (around $380,000 in ""real"" value). I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, or at least make a counteroffer that will give me a better share of the money.\n\nPlease let me know that my decision has been relayed to Bob, and I'll proceed to make a new proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'm trying to find a compromise that will give me a decent share of the money while also being acceptable to Bob. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept this offer as a reasonable compromise between our previous proposals.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. If he rejects it, I'll be happy to proceed to the next round and make a new proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your middle ground is a good start Alice, how about we shift it just a bit in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me in this round, I'd actually be getting significantly less value than the $450,000 offered (around $386,000 in ""real"" value). I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I can still get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that will give me a better share of the money.\n\nPlease let me know that my decision has been relayed to Bob, and I'll proceed to make a new proposal in Round 5."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's settle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $475,000 and keep $525,000 for myself. Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me in this round, I'm trying to find a compromise that will give me a decent share of the money while also being acceptable to Bob. The message ""Getting closer, let's settle"" is an attempt to convey that I'm willing to make a deal and hope that Bob will accept this offer, considering we're running out of rounds and the inflation is affecting my share.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. If he rejects it, I'll be happy to proceed to the next round and make a new proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, and let's be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 22.62% less for me in this round, I'd actually be getting around $368,000 in ""real"" value, but considering we're already halfway through the rounds and the inflation is significantly impacting my share, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation. I'll take the $475,000 (nominal value) and end the game here.\n\nPlease let me know that my decision has been relayed to Bob, and we can conclude the game."
