{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking 900,000 and giving Bob 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
``` 

I'm going to take a slightly smaller share this round, but still a majority, as Bob's offer was too low. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation rate is eating away at my potential gains. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm lowering my share again, hoping to find a compromise that Bob will accept.  We're running out of time, and I want to secure a decent share before inflation hits too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much better than the previous one. It's a 50/50 split with a slight advantage for Bob.  With the inflation rate, it's a much better deal than risking it all and ending up with nothing."
