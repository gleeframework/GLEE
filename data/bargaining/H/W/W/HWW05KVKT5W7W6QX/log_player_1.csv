"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a division of $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair division to start the negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I would actually be getting less value than initially proposed, and I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, this is fairer""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, where my gain is worth 10% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than the initial round, I'm adjusting my offer. I propose $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob, highlighting the fairness considering the devaluation. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slight loss to end this. Let's agree to this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, especially on Bob's, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and further negotiations might lead to even less valuable outcomes. Accepting now secures a significant amount, despite it being less than my initial proposals. It's time to conclude the negotiations."
