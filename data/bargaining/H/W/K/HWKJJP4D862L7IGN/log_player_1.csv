"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'll consider it.
