"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point, but I'm not going to let Alice get away with such a lopsided deal. I'll see what she's willing to offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  I propose a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a decent share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's go with a 60/40 split.  This is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is a significant improvement over her first proposal. While I'd prefer an even split, getting 4000$ is better than risking further negotiations and potentially getting less due to inflation."
