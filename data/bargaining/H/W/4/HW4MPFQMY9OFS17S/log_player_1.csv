"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with $400,000. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, the $400,000 I would gain is actually worth 95% of its original value. 

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not split it 60-40 in his favor, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round now (5% less in each of the two previous rounds), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```"
