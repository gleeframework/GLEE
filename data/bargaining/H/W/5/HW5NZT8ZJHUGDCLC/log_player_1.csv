  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 into $7,500 for me and $2,500 for you. This way, we can both agree on a fair share before the value of money decreases in the next round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is a more equitable division, considering the potential for value loss in the next round.  Let's end this game amicably and secure a decent amount for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
