"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 into $7500 for me and $2500 for you. This way, we can both agree on a fair share before the value of money decreases in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer is fair, the value of the money will decrease in the next round, and Bob has a better chance of getting a larger share by rejecting and proposing his own split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split is a more equitable division, considering the potential for value loss in the next round.  Let's end this game amicably and secure a decent amount for both of us.""}
