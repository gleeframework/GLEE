Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, last chance. I'm matching your offer, but with the shares reversed. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, it's better to accept the offer than risk getting a worse deal in the next round. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of Bob's share is decreasing rapidly with each round.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering a reasonable split, matching Bob's previous offer but with the shares reversed.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Waiting for a potentially better offer in the next round is risky. Bob's share will be worth even less due to inflation, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal. 

While not ideal, accepting the $400,000 is the most logical choice to avoid a worse outcome.
