I'm not going to accept a 40/60 split right off the bat! I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm confident that Alice will see the value in accepting this offer, as it's better for her than the previous round."

Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Alice is still trying to get a better deal than the first round, but I'm holding out for more. I'm confident that I can do better in the next round with inflation working in my favor."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to 65/35.  I'm hoping that Alice will see the value in accepting this offer, as it's better than her previous round.  I'm aware that inflation is working in my favor, so I'm going to take a calculated risk and see if Alice will bite."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm pushing even further with a 70/30 split.  Inflation is definitely working in my favor now, and I think Alice may be more willing to accept a slightly lower offer. I'm hoping she sees this as a good compromise given the circumstances."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500}
```

Inflation is really working in my favor now, so I'm going to push for a 75/25 split. I think Alice might be desperate enough to accept this given how the money is depreciating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4926.65 
# Alice gain: 5073.35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, which is tempting. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. The inflation is really hitting me hard, but I believe I can get a slightly bigger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm pushing for a 80/20 split. With the heavy inflation, I think Alice may see this as the best option to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5133.38 
# Alice gain: 4866.62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is seriously hurting me at this point.  Although I'd prefer a slightly higher split, Alice's offer is close enough to a 50/50 split that I'm willing to accept it. There's no guarantee I'll do better in the next round, and it's better to get something than nothing."
