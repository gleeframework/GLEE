  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""

# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much ground yet! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since I was hoping for a more even split, I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
