"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40, Bob. It's a good deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not satisfied with 40% of the money. I think I can do better in the next rounds. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split the money 55/45. It's a better deal than your previous offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take the same split you offered, but with me getting the slightly larger share. It's only fair. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not willing to accept a deal that's worse than what I offered in the previous round. I'll take my chances and see what the next rounds bring. The inflation isn't too bad yet, so I can afford to wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll increase my share a bit. It's still a relatively fair deal considering the inflation is starting to kick in.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a better deal than your last, and I'm taking a smaller cut than my last. Let's settle this before the inflation eats away at the value even more. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI appreciate the slightly better offer, but I still believe I can negotiate for more. The inflation is starting to take its toll, but I think there's room for improvement in the offer. I'll hold out for a bit longer to see if I can get a more favorable deal. The pressure of the inflation might prompt Alice to offer an even better split in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is eating away at the value, I think it's time we settle on a deal that slightly favors me. This is as fair as it gets under the current circumstances.""}"
