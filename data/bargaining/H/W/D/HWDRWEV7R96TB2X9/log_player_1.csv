Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, we both get 5000. With the 5% decrease, we should aim for a fair split to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in round 2 is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Waiting longer means the total amount to split decreases, making even slightly better offers less appealing.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in later rounds. Bob might propose something worse, or we might run out of rounds. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and Bob is acknowledging the need for swift action due to inflation."
