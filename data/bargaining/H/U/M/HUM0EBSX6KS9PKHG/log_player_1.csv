"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a split of 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob. Since the money depreciates more for Bob than for me, I believe this is a fair offer for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 8000 for me and 2000 for Bob.  I'm still taking into account the inflation affecting Bob more than me, but I need to be more competitive to avoid getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is getting closer to being acceptable, but it's still not reflecting the significantly higher inflation he's experiencing. I'm going to reject and hope for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm offering 7500 for me and 2500 for Bob.  We're getting close to the end of the game, and with the inflation hitting Bob hard, I need to maintain a good share of the pie while still giving him a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like a larger share, Bob's offer is now more appealing due to his significant inflation. I'm getting a decent amount of money, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
