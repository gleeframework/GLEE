"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This way, I'll get 40% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit better than my initial offer, but I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.
