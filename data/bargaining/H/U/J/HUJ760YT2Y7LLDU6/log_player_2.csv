"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm being flexible, but time is running out. This is a good deal for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the time pressure is on, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. Accepting this offer would mean I lose a significant chunk of the potential gain. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic.  50/50 is the fairest option.  Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is eating into my potential gains with each round.  While I want a slight advantage, it's time to put a firm offer on the table. A 50/50 split is fair and straightforward, and it sends a clear message that I'm not going to be lowballed.  Alice needs to realize that her delaying tactics will hurt us both in the end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 isn't really 50/50 with inflation 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is absolutely right, my 50/50 offer is no longer 50/50 with the inflation factored in. However, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show that I'm willing to negotiate but not be taken advantage of.  I'll counter with a slightly better offer for her, but time is running out, and I need to be realistic."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It gives you a clear advantage, but also recognizes the impact of the inflation on my end. We need to settle this now before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and I need to be decisive. This offer is a compromise - it acknowledges the impact of inflation on my potential gain while still giving Alice a larger share. I'm conveying urgency and a willingness to be reasonable, but I'm also setting a firm boundary. It's up to Alice now to choose a reasonable deal over the risk of getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is agonizing, but I have to be realistic.  Alice is playing hardball, and the relentless inflation is crippling my position.  If I reject this, the next offer is likely to be even worse, and we risk ending up with nothing.  Taking the $3,900 is far from ideal, but it's better than walking away empty-handed after twelve rounds."
