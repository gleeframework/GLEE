"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division is fair and will save us both time from the effects of inflation.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was tempting Bob, but still favors you considering the inflation. I'm aiming for a more balanced deal. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it still heavily favors her, especially considering the accelerated inflation she faces. It's in my best interest to hold out for a better deal as long as I don't appear too unreasonable and risk her accepting a less favorable offer in later rounds."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating into our potential gains. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While not ideal, Alice's offer is the best I'm likely to get at this stage. 

Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is significantly impacting our potential gains. Accepting a less favorable offer now might be better than holding out for a slightly better deal and risking a much lower payout due to inflation in later rounds.
* **Alice's Ultimatum:** Her ""final offer"" statement suggests increasing firmness in her position. Rejecting this might lead to her entrenching further and offering even less favorable terms later. 

It's a tough call, but sometimes a reasonable compromise is better than risking a significant loss."
