"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a counteroffer, but Bob's proposal is a good compromise. Considering the inflation, I'd rather accept this offer than risk waiting for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
