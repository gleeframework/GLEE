"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight bias towards me, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think it's unfair that I would get only $400,000 while Bob gets $600,000. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get $420,000 and Bob gets $580,000. I'm trying to find a balance between my previous offer and Bob's previous offer, hoping that this one will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more aggressive, but I think it's time to make a move 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. The gap between our proposed gains is getting too wide, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of getting only $300,000 while Bob gets $700,000. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer in the next round to close the gap."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 360000, ""bob_gain"": 640000, ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing that I get $360,000 and Bob gets $640,000. I'm trying to close the gap and find a more balanced split, hoping that this offer will be more acceptable to Bob."
