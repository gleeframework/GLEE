Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""

```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not sure if it's fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on my potential gain! With my share being worth 48.8% less than the original $10,000, I'm not thrilled about accepting a smaller share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
