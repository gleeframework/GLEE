I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  This might encourage him to accept quickly, avoiding the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This offer is too low for me. I'd rather take the risk of another round and try to negotiate a better deal. I'll be able to counter with a more appealing offer to Bob next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than his last offer. Since the money is losing value for both of us, I'll try to find a middle ground to make this offer appealing."
