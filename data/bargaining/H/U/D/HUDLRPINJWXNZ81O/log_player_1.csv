"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of its original value.

I'll reject Bob's offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is still quite skewed in his favor, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation adjustment, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 45.6% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55.5% of its original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a relatively close split, and I'm willing to settle for this deal given the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.
