"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a better starting point, given the inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, and I think I can do better. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try 52-48. What do you think?""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still trying to be reasonable and find a middle ground."
