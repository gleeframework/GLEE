"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take more this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the value of the money Bob gains. With the 10% inflation, Bob's gain of $6000 is equivalent to $5400 in the first round. That's a significant increase from my initial offer!

However, I'm not willing to give up $2000 more than I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not that much!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and still getting a fair share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take most of it this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, it seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain of $7000 is equivalent to $5400 in the first round. That's a significant increase from my previous offers. However, I'm not willing to give up $2000 more than my previous offer.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting taken advantage of that easily!""
}
