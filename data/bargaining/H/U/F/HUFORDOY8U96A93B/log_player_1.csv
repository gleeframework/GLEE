"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm going first, I'm taking the larger share. This will hopefully incentivize Bob to accept quickly, as the money will depreciate with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  Bob's offer, while giving me a smaller share, is still better than risking the money depreciating further in the following rounds."
