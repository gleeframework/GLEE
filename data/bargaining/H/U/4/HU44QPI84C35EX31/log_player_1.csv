"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work towards something more even later.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something. This accounts for the time value of money - I need more to compensate for inflation! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is drastically unfair. While I recognize the need to account for inflation, a 70/30 split is too extreme. I'm willing to compromise, but not at that price."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try to find some middle ground. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something closer to 60/40.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time! This is my final compromise. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, we're rapidly approaching the deadline. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure something for myself, even if it's not ideal."
