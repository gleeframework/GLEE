Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  I want to get the most money possible while keeping the inflation in mind, but I also want to be fair.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I am getting a significantly smaller share, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting even less in the next round."
