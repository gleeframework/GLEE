"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take a slightly larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $4000 * 0.9 = $3600 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's proposal, as it seems he's taking a larger share without any additional justification. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about your offer, Bob. How about 55/45 in my favor?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has hit again, so my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Since I'm proposing the offer, my gain will be worth 90% of the previous round's gain, which is $3600 * 0.9 = $3240.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of rejection. How about 42/58?""
}
```"
