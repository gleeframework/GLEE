Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split that acknowledges the time value of money for both of us. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're approaching the halfway point, and we both need to be realistic. I'm proposing a split that's closer to the middle ground. Accepting this offer now makes more sense than dragging this out further and losing more value. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000
