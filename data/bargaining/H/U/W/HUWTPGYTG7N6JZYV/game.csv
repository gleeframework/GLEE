5250.0,4750.0,Let's be fair and split the money almost equally. I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer. This way we both benefit from ending the game quickly.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but I'm hoping for a slightly better deal for myself.  Let's split it 55/45 this time and end the game.",Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  Let's stop wasting time with the back and forth and split this evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,
