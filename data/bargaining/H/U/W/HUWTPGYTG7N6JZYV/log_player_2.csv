"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost equally. I get slightly more since I'm making the first offer. This way we both benefit from ending the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but I'm hoping for a slightly better deal for myself.  Let's split it 55/45 this time and end the game.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  Let's stop wasting time with the back and forth and split this evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to continue negotiating, the inflation is a serious concern. Accepting a 50/50 split is the most sensible option to avoid losing more money."
