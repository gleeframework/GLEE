"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, the 3000 I would gain in this round is worth 95% of what I would have gained in the first round, so it's still a decent amount.

However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to give Bob 7000, which is worth 95% of the original 5000 I offered him in the first round. That's a significant concession.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
