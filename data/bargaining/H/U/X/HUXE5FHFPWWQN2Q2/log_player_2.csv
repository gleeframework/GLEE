"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but I need a bit more for it to be worthwhile for me. How about this?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, but I think I can do a bit better. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is barely better than her first one after accounting for inflation. Let's see if she's willing to budge a bit more."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Let's close this out and avoid losing any more to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know you said that was your final offer, but I think you'll find this one more appealing than getting nothing. 57-43 is still a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but with the inflation eating into my share, it's getting risky to hold out for more. Accepting now guarantees I get something, even if it's not ideal."
