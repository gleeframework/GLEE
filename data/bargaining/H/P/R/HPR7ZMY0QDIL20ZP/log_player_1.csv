"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time. I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the value of the money is going down each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 45/55 split, as I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the value of money is decreasing""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money."
