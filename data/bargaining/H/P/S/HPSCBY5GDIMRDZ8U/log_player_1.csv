Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give Alice a bigger share to get the game started, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
