Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough spot. While the offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means heading into another round where the money is worth even less to me. Accepting $300,000 is better than risking an even lower offer or ending up with nothing."
