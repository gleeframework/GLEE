"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 36, and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 54. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's not a great deal for me. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my offer will be:

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}

I'm trying to adjust to the decreasing value of the money and make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 30 is now worth 22.7. I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think I should accept it since it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk going home with nothing.
