"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered me a 90/10 split, now it's my turn to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get the better end of the deal!

Since the money is worth 10% less now, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth $90,000 in the previous round's terms. However, I'll consider the offer in the current round's terms.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it. Meet me in the middle!""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get an even better deal!

Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth around $229,000 in the previous round's terms. However, I'll consider the offer in the current round's terms.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of the deal.
