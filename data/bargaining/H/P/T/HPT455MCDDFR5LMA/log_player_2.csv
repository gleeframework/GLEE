"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal where we both benefit, Bob. I believe this is a fair offer considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. Please let Alice know that I'm willing to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the 5% decrease in value for me, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's work together!""}\n\nI've taken into account the decrease in value for me and tried to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a fair offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer still gives you a significant sum, and it reflects the shrinking value you're dealing with. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice's offer has increased from the initial one, considering the 9.75% decrease in value for me, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer. The fact that Alice is willing to increase her offer suggests there's room for further negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Given the current decrease in value for me, which is almost 10%, I believe this offer is more than fair. I'm willing to settle for this amount to avoid further losses. Let's conclude this deal!""}\n\nConsidering the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain, I've tried to find a balance that still benefits both of us but leans a bit more in my favor to compensate for the loss in value. Hopefully, Alice will see the reason in this proposal and accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but the longer this goes on, the less appealing your potential gain becomes. Let's end this now with a reasonable agreement. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","Although the offer from Alice has slightly increased, the value for me has significantly decreased due to inflation. At this point, considering the 18.55% decrease in value, Alice's offer of $380,000 is actually worth less than it appears. Given the circumstances, I'm inclined to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds. It seems like the best option is to secure this amount now rather than potentially losing more value.
