"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous split, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, let's see if you accept 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $400,000.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob halfway, since I'm not getting a better deal than I offered in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain of $500,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the previous round, which is $400,000.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You made a good offer last round, but I want a bit more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 45% of what it was in the first round, which is $450,000. However, considering the inflation, I'm actually getting a better deal than in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, since I was hoping for a better deal. But Bob is offering a slightly bigger share, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if I reject this offer. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
