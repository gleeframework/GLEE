"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm not satisfied with getting only 40% of the total amount, considering the inflation doesn't affect me. I believe I can negotiate for a better share, especially since the pressure of inflation is on Alice. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more since I'm not affected by inflation. This way, we both get a decent share, and you still get a significant amount considering the decreasing value.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to offer Alice 45% of the total amount, which is $4,500, while I take $5,500. Given the inflation pressure on Alice, I believe this offer is reasonable, as it still provides her with a substantial amount while acknowledging the impact of inflation on her share. Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse for me each round. Meet me in the middle while it's still worthwhile for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Given that the money's value remains the same for me but decreases for Alice, I see no reason to accept a deal that's less favorable than what I previously offered. I'm aiming to maximize my share, considering the conditions, so I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal or see if Alice becomes more flexible due to the increasing pressure of inflation on her end."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation on your end, I'm willing to take a bit more. This offer is still reasonable, given the circumstances. Let's settle before it gets worse for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to increase my proposed share to $5,800, while offering Alice $4,200. Given the decreasing value of the money for Alice due to inflation, I believe this offer is still within the realm of reasonableness, especially considering the pressure on her to reach a deal before the value drops further. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to her, given the current state of the negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, or I'm going to start being unreasonable! It's still more than you offered me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Despite Alice's warning that she'll start being unreasonable, I believe the pressure of inflation is on her side, and she's more likely to make concessions as the rounds progress. Given that the money's value remains the same for me, I'm willing to take the risk and wait for a better offer or make another proposal that's more favorable to me. Let's see how Alice responds in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand your frustration, but I'm not affected by inflation. This offer is still generous, considering the circumstances. It's time for us to reach a deal before it gets even worse for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to increase my proposed share to $6,000, while offering Alice $4,000. Given the significant impact of inflation on Alice's end, with her share now being worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I believe this offer is still relatively generous. The pressure is mounting on Alice to reach a deal, and I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to her, considering the rapidly decreasing value of her potential share. Let's see how Alice responds to this proposal!"
