"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Calculate the value of money after the first round for both players.
After the first round, the money is worth 5% less for Bob and 20% less for Alice.

### Step 2: Determine the effective value of the 100$ for both players in the second round.
For Bob, the effective value is 100$ * 0.95 = 95$.
For Alice, the effective value is 100$ * 0.80 = 80$.

### Step 3: Decide on a proposal that takes into account the effective values and the need to reach an agreement within the limited rounds.
Considering the effective values and the fact that Alice's money value decreases more significantly, Bob should propose a division that slightly favors himself but remains reasonable for Alice to accept.

### Step 4: Formulate the proposal in the JSON format.
Given the considerations, Bob proposes a division where he receives 55$ and Alice receives 45$, along with a message to Alice.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the split to 55/45. It's a fair offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Inflation is affecting both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest option now.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the impact of inflation on the value of money for both players in the third round.
Given that the money Bob gains is worth 9.75% less and the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round, we need to calculate the effective value of the proposed split.

### Step 2: Calculate the effective value of the proposed 50/50 split for both players.
For Bob, the effective value is 50$ * (1 - 0.0975) = 50$ * 0.9025 = 45.125$.
For Alice, the effective value is 50$ * (1 - 0.36) = 50$ * 0.64 = 32$.

### Step 3: Determine if the proposed split is favorable considering the decreasing value of money and the limited rounds left.
Given the significant decrease in value for Alice and the relatively smaller decrease for Bob, a 50/50 split seems more favorable to Bob in real terms.

### Step 4: Decide on the response to Alice's offer.
Since the offer is reasonable and the effective value slightly favors Bob due to the less severe impact of inflation on his side, accepting the offer might be the best course of action to secure a gain before the money's value decreases further.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
