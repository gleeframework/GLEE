Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the first to propose and have the advantage of the initial offer. I believe this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a significant portion as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation makes it less favorable for me.  I'd prefer to see a more equitable split that reflects the decreased value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}
```

I'm offering a 52/48 split in my favor.  This reflects the inflation that has occurred, but also seeks to bridge the gap and potentially reach a compromise."
