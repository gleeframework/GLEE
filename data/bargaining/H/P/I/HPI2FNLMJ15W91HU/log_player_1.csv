Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some for myself to account for the potential loss of value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
