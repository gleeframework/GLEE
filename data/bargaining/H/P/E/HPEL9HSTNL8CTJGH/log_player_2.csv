"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to be fair, but I won't go below this. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. This means her offers are likely to get worse for her, and thus potentially better for you.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is very risky. The inflation rate is punishing, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer even this much in future rounds.

While 42 isn't much more than the initial offer of 40, it's better to take a reasonable gain now than risk getting a much worse deal later.
