Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With 12 rounds to go, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than half of the money, especially considering the looming threat of inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we should split it closer to 50/50. Let's try to be more even.""}\n\n###\nI've decided to offer a slightly more even split, with me getting $55 and Alice getting $45. I'm hoping this will be more palatable to Alice and we can come to an agreement before the inflation really starts to take its toll. I've also included a message explaining my reasoning and trying to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness. \n\n###\n### Assistant"
