950000.0,50000.0,"Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. You get a quick $50,000, and I take the majority to avoid us losing money to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want the majority, but this is a negotiation. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be more realistic. My turn to propose: I take $800,000, and you get $200,000. This still gives you a significant sum, and it accounts for the fact that the value decreases with each round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, this is going in circles. We need to find a middle ground. I'm lowering my ask to 650,000 for me and 350,000 for you.  Time is literally money in this game!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, we're getting closer, but your offer still undervalues the time factor.  I'm willing to go down to $750,000 for me.  That's $250,000 for you, which is still a substantial sum.  Let's not let it dwindle any further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. 60/40 split. It acknowledges the time pressure but is still a fair division. If you reject this, I'm aiming for a 50/50 split in the remaining rounds. Don't let's risk losing everything!",Bob,6,
