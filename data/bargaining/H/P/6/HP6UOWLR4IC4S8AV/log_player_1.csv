"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, let's see if you'll take a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain of $20 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $18. That's not a great deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offer was 20-80 in my favor, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting any younger 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain of $30 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is approximately $21.87. That's still not a great deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offer was 30-70 in my favor, I'll try to negotiate an even better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob! Meet me at 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
