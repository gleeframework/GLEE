``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 20% cut! I'll take my chances with the inflation and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This way, I'll get a bit more, but it's still a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not ideal for me. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is hitting us both, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try flipping the script from the last round. I'll take a bigger share this time, but it's still a fair deal considering the inflation. What do you say?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is not a good deal for me considering the significant inflation we're both facing. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
