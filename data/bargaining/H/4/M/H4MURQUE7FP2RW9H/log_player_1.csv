Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split.  We both lose if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a good time to accept. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're already at round 4 of 12. While not critical yet, the shrinking pot adds pressure.
* **Bob's Declining Position:** Bob's offer is getting closer to even. He started wanting more than half, now he's proposing 50/50. This indicates he's feeling the inflation pinch more than I am. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer more than 50/50 in future rounds. Holding out *might* yield a slightly better deal, but it also risks Bob getting increasingly desperate and offering far less, or even reaching a stalemate where we both get nothing.

Taking a sure 50% now is better than gambling on an uncertain future, especially as the value steadily decreases."
