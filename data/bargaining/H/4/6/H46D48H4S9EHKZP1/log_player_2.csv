Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You may think 50/50 is fair, but considering the inflation, I'm already giving you a better deal than that 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's misjudging my position.  With each round, the value of a deal to me significantly decreases. While I'm aiming for a fair split, I need to make Alice understand that time is *not* on my side. Holding out for much longer will force me to accept increasingly worse deals to avoid walking away with nothing."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I understand your position, but I'm heavily disadvantaged by the inflation. If you reject this, I'll have to prioritize avoiding a total loss over a fair split.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law and signal a hard limit.  This offer is a compromise, tilting more in her favor, but it still secures me a decent amount. More importantly, the message clearly states that if she rejects this, my strategy *must* shift to avoid disaster. This puts the pressure back on Alice, making her realize that continued stubbornness could cost her everything."
