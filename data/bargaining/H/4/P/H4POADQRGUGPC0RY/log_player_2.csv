"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I understand these negotiations can be tricky, so I'm offering you 40% upfront. A good deal considering the circumstances, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a decent starting point, but I think I can get a better deal considering the inflation factor. I'll propose something in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Since the money depreciates faster for you than it does for me, I'm offering you 450,000. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. My offer is decreasing, but time is not on my side.  I'm proposing 550,000 for me and 450,000 for you. It's the same split you wanted last round, but now it benefits me.  Take the deal before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is a good compromise considering the inflation factor. It's better than what I proposed in the previous round, and it's not a huge loss for me."
