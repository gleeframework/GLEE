Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 3:2 ratio. I take 60$, and you take 40$. This maintains a similar distribution to the previous round but accounts for the decrease in value of your share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
