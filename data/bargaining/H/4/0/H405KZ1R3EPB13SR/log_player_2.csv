"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I take a bit more upfront since the inflation hits me harder. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 60/40 split is appealing, it's worth considering the inflation factor. Alice's offer might seem generous now, but with each round, the value of her share decreases by 20% while mine only decreases by 5%. It's in my best interest to see if I can negotiate a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it closer to even, but I need a better deal than your initial offer. Let's see if we can come to a fair agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking, and that inflation is no joke.  Let's meet in the middle - my turn to get a slightly better split. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's initial offer seemed more favorable, the inflation is significantly hurting her. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's not my ideal split. Further rounds increase the risk of both of us losing everything."
