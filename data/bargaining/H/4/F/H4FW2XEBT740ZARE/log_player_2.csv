Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were generous, now it's my turn to be realistic, considering the decreasing value for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and it's hurting us both. Let's end this with a perfectly fair split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the rapidly decreasing value for you 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the value of waiting any further is unlikely to outweigh the losses Bob is incurring due to inflation.  While not ideal, accepting the current offer prevents further losses."
