Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still the same as in the first round.  I understand the inflation is a factor, but we need to be realistic.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me (Alice) with each round. It's in my best interest to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Bob's Motivation:** Bob's offer in Round 2 suggests he's willing to negotiate, but he's also trying to take advantage of my situation with inflation. 
* **Holding Firm:** By sticking to my original offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious and that I understand the value of the deal is diminishing. This might encourage Bob to accept in this round or make a more favorable counter-offer in Round 4."
