"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a fair share and can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
