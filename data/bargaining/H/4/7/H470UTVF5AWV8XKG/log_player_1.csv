I'll offer Bob a measly $1 and keep the rest for myself. I figure he'll be tempted to accept since it's better than nothing, and I'll get the lion's share!  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a 50/50 split. While I'd prefer to keep more, I'm not sure how many more rounds we'll have before inflation hits my share significantly. Accepting is the safer bet."
