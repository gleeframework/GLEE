"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want to keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by the inflation as Bob is.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to negotiate further in the next round. For now, I'll take the 70 and hope to do better in the next round.
