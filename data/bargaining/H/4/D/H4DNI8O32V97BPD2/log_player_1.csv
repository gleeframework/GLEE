Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000. I'm keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly invitation to make a counteroffer or accept this proposal."
