"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than the 70/30 ratio. Let's meet in the middle and split the money 50/50. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
