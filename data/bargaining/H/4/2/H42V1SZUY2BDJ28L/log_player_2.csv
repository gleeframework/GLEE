"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to maximize my gains. This is just the first round, so I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, given that the money is depreciating with each round. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering depreciation, let's meet halfway 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's counteroffer is fair considering the inflation. Accepting this offer will ensure I receive some money, and the decreasing value means waiting for another round could result in an even smaller share."
