"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. We both lose a lot if we keep going. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal, and the longer the game goes on the more money we both lose due to inflation. Accepting 400,000 is better than risking getting nothing.
