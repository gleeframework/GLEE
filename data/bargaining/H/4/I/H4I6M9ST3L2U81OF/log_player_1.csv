"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split, but I'm actually hoping he'll accept this offer to get the game started quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is better, considering the inflation will affect us differently 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $45 is actually worth $45 * 0.9 = $40.90, and Bob's gain of $55 is actually worth $55 * 0.95 = $52.25.

I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me, but I'm willing to accept it for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
