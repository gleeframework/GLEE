Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it nearly evenly, slightly in my favor considering the inflation. This ensures we both benefit from ending the game now.

# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better if we split it more evenly.  This offer accounts for your inflation, but gives me a slightly larger share since I'm taking on the risk of a further round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split it evenly now, Bob.  This is your last chance to avoid further inflation impacting my share. It's in both our best interests to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk Alice getting a better deal in the next round."
