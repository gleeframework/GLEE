"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at this stage of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 400,000 is now worth 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000.

I'll reject this offer because I'd like to try to get a better deal. My current gain of 360,000 is still a significant portion of the remaining money, so I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a relatively fair deal considering the remaining amount."
