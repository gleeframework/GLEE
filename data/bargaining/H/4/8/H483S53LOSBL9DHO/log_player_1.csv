"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in my favor. This reflects the decreasing value of money and gives you a fair share while still leaving me with a majority. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
