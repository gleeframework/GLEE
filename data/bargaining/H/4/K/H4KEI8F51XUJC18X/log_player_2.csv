"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take $60, and you get $40. It's important to settle this quickly because of the inflation.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your sense of fairness is a little off. Let's split the difference from your offer -  55 for me, 45 for you.  This makes sense considering the inflation will hurt you more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day.  Another round and we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
