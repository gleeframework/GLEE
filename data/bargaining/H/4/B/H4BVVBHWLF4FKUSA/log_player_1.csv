"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
# My gain: 50
# Inflation factor: 0.9 (10% less)
# My gain in real value: 50 * 0.9 = 45
```

Bob's gain is worth 5% less, but I don't know the exact inflation factor for Bob, so I'll just consider the numbers as they are.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
