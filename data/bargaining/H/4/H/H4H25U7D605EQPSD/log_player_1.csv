"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. Hopefully, he'll see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's split a little closer to the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer is still not fair in my opinion. I was willing to give him 40% in the first round, but now he's offering me only 45% of the original amount, which is actually less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI'll offer Bob a bit more than my initial offer, but less than his offer in the previous round. Hopefully, he'll see this as a compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It seems we both want more than half. This is my final offer above 5000. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, but considering the inflation, 4800 is actually worth significantly less than what it was in the first round. I'll take the risk and reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round or force Bob to make an even better offer later on.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Don't say it's your final offer if you don't mean it""}

I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer than before, trying to take advantage of Bob's willingness to make concessions. I'm hoping he'll be tempted by the prospect of getting 4400 dollars and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, you drive a hard bargain.  Let's settle this and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer. 4900 dollars, although worth less than initially, is still a substantial amount. I don't want to risk going further and ending up with nothing, so I'll accept this offer and settle the game."
