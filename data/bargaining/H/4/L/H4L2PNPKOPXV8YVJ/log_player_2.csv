Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to compromise. A 58-42 split is more reasonable, as I'm losing less value over time compared to you.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but the game's dynamics still favor me.  Even with the more significant inflation hitting my potential gains, waiting her out is the stronger play right now. It's a risk, but getting to round 6 and beyond puts significant pressure on her to make a much better offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5050,
""alice_gain"": 4950,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're both losing serious money with each round. 50/50 was never on the table for me given the inflation, but I'll take a slight hit at 50.5/49.5 just to end this now before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on now. While I want to push for a better deal, rounds 6-8 are about maximizing my chances of getting *anything*. A near 50/50 split with a very slight advantage to me is likely the best I'll get before Alice gets truly desperate. This conveys urgency while still aiming for a marginally better outcome than simply splitting it down the middle."
