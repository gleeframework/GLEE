Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But I'm not losing value, you are. I think this split is more than fair considering the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While my potential gains are shrinking, accepting a deal significantly worse than my original offer is not rational.  I need to show Bob I'm willing to risk it going to even later rounds unless he negotiates fairly."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  You can take it now, or we both risk losing even more. I'm willing to accept a smaller share to end this now, but I won't be taken advantage of.""}"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we've reached the point where it's clear I have the upper hand. I'm willing to end this, but I'm not going to give up my advantage. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  Tragically, the game has reached a point where Bob holds all the cards.  While this offer is far from ideal, rejecting it would mean going into further rounds where the inflation would decimate my potential earnings. It's painful, but accepting this offer cuts my losses and ends the game."
