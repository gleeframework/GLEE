"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the money 55/45 in my favor.  Remember, the value of the money is decreasing for both of us, so it's in our best interest to come to an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  Given the inflation working against me, I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting now would mean I lose a significant portion of the potential gain."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and the value is decreasing.  My final offer is a 52/48 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the time pressure and the decreasing value to push for a decision.
* **Slight Concession:** I've increased my offer slightly from the previous round to show some flexibility.
* **Framing:** I'm presenting this as my ""final offer"" to make it seem like this is my last concession.  

This offer is still advantageous to me while acknowledging the need to reach an agreement before inflation erodes too much value."
