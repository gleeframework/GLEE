"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
