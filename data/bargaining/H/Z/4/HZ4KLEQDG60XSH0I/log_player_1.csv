"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful.

I'll reject this offer, as it seems too even-handed, considering the inflation effect. I'd rather aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less, but still being generous enough to make the offer acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! The money is worth significantly less now.

Considering the offer from Bob, I think I should take it, as it's a relatively small difference from the original amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.
