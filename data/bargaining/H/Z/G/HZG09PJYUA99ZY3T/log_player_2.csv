"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob. I'm offering you a smaller share now, but remember the money will depreciate faster for you in the later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Since the money depreciates faster for me, I think this offer is more reasonable.""}\n\nI'm trying to take into account the depreciation of the money and offering a more balanced split. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split the difference from the previous round. Remember, the money depreciates faster for both of us as we go on, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer in round 3. Considering the depreciation of the money, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. The difference in depreciation rates between us might give me some leverage to get a more favorable split. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, considering the depreciation, I think this offer is more suitable. Let's try to meet in the middle while taking into account the decreasing value of the money.""}\n\nI'm trying to find a balance between our interests and the impact of inflation on the money's value. Hopefully, this offer will be more acceptable to Alice."
