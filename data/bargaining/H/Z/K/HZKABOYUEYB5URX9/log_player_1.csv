"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money worth 10% less after the first round and another 10% less after Bob's rejected offer, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a middle ground."
