"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous this round, Bob. Take this as a friendly gesture.  Let's see what you propose next.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That's a very generous offer Alice, but let's be fair.  I propose a 60/40 split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your fairness, but I'm sticking to my original goal of a 90/10 split.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.  This is my final offer before I take the lead again. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is heavily discounting the impact of inflation on her gains. While her offer seems generous on the surface, the longer the game goes on, the more it plays in my favor. I'm willing to push her a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, we both know time is on my side here. I appreciate your offers, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the pot.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time here. Let's split this evenly and call it a day.  I think we both would be happier with something rather than nothing.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'm confident I could squeeze a bit more out of Alice, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing rapidly. A 50/50 split is fair, and guarantees a reasonable payout considering the inflation."
