"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but give you a small share to show good faith. We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, accepting the offer of $1,000 out of $1,000,000 is highly unfavorable, especially considering that the value of the money decreases by 5% for Bob with each passing round, but remains constant for Alice. Given the significant disparity in the proposed division, it is logical to reject the offer in anticipation of negotiating a more equitable distribution in subsequent rounds. The impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings further incentivizes seeking a better deal before the money's value diminishes further. Thus, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round to make a counteroffer is the most strategic decision for Bob at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven the substantial imbalance in Alice's initial offer and the fact that the value of money decreases by 5% for me with each round, my strategy is to propose a more equitable division while also considering the impact of inflation. Since the value of money has already decreased by 5% for me from the initial round, it's crucial to negotiate a significant share to compensate for the loss in value over subsequent rounds. Thus, I will propose a division that reflects a more balanced approach, aiming to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.
