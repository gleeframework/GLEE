Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn.  I'll take a slight advantage this round, considering you got greedy last time. Let's be reasonable, this deal benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The longer we drag this out, the less we both get. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is finally realizing the impact of inflation on his potential gains. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in earlier rounds, it's becoming increasingly fair as time goes on and his potential gains dwindle. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable share, whereas continuing the game carries the risk of Bob making even less appealing offers later on."
