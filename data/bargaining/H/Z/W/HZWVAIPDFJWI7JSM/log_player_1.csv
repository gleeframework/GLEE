"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to meet in the middle. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I was hoping to get a slightly better deal, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Meeting in the middle would give us both $50, which is a bit too low for me. I'd like to propose again and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 70% and reducing Bob's share to 30%. This is a more favorable split for me, but I'm still leaving some room for compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more than 40% 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I was hoping to get at least 50% of the $100. Giving Bob 60% would leave me with a relatively small share, which I'm not comfortable with. I'd like to make another proposal and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. This is a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55% and reducing Bob's share to 45%. This is a more balanced split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is pushing for a big majority! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because giving Bob 70% of the $100 would leave me with a very small share, which is not acceptable. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is too skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to make another proposal and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. This is my final compromise. Will you accept it?""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 58% and reducing Bob's share to 42%. This is a relatively close split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to think of something else!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small token, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing for a huge majority! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because giving Bob 80% of the $100 would leave me with a tiny share, which is unacceptable. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is way too skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to make another proposal and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up yet, Bob. This is my last serious offer. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 65% and reducing Bob's share to 35%. This is a more balanced split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to think of something else, and I'm not sure what I'll do if that happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to compromise further. This is my final offer 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is being quite firm! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because giving Bob 90% of the $100 would leave me with a ridiculously small share. I was hoping for a more reasonable split, and this offer is completely unacceptable. I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with just $10. I'd rather try to make another proposal and risk losing the game than accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm getting desperate! Here's my new offer for Round 11:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up now, Bob. This is my last-ditch effort. Will you accept it?""
}
```

I'm taking a risk and proposing a 80/20 split in my favor. This is a big ask, but I'm hoping Bob will be so tired of negotiating that he'll accept it. If he rejects this offer, I'm not sure what I'll do..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to compromise further. I get it all 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is going for the win! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's completely unfair. Giving Bob 100% of the $100 would leave me with nothing, which is unacceptable. I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with zero. Since this is the last round, I'm afraid we'll both end up with nothing."
