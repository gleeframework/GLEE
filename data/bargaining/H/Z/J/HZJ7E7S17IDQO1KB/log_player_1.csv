"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting my proposal early on and avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 in this round is equivalent to $475,000 in the first round, which is a decent amount.

However, I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 50/50 split, especially since the money is worth less for him due to the 20% inflation. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still trying to maintain a decent margin. The money is worth less with each passing round, so I need to be strategic about how much I give away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair considering the inflation.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the new values, my gain of $400,000 in this round is equivalent to $862,500 in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

However, I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth less for him due to the inflation. I think I can do better than that.

I'm also considering that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round, so I need to make a decision carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, but I'm still in control.""
}
```

I'm trying to maintain a balance between getting a decent share of the money and not giving Bob too much. The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I need to be strategic about how much I give away."
