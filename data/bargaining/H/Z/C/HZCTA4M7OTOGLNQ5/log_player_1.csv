Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the $450,000 I would gain in this round is actually worth $427,500 in real terms. Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, which is 5% less than 95% of the original value, so it's 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original value.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less in each round, after 3 rounds, it's worth 0.95^3 = 0.857375 of the original value.

To calculate the actual value of $400,000 in this round, I'll multiply it by the inflation factor: 0.857375 * 400,000 = $341,500.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.
