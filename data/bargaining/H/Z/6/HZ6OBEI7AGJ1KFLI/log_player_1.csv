"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start by being generous with Bob, giving him a tiny amount, knowing that the value of the money will decrease significantly for him in the next round. This way, I can secure almost all the money for myself while incentivizing Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm getting a much smaller share, it's still a significant amount of money. If I reject this offer, the next round I'll be stuck with an even smaller share as Bob's offer will be worth less due to inflation."
