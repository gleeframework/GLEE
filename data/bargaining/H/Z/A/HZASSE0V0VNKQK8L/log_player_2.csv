Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share. It's a fair deal given the inflation.

# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go a little higher, but this is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us, considering the time is running out.  Accept this, and we'll both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation working so heavily against me, it's better to take something now than risk getting even less later. Waiting any longer could mean getting a deal worse than my initial 10% offer."
