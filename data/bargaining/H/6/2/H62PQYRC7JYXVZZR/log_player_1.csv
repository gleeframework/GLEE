"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm sure Bob might have other ideas!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 50-50 split, especially since I'm still facing a 10% decrease in the value of my share due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation. The inflation factor is still in play, so I need to think carefully about the numbers!"
