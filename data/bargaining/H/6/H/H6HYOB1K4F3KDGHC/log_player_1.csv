"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is a fair offer considering the inflation rates: I'm taking a large chunk of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount. This allows for a possible acceptance in the first round, avoiding the risk of losing value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I don't like the offer, it's better than risking further inflation.  Accepting guarantees me at least something, even though it's a much smaller share than I initially proposed."
