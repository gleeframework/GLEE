"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  While I want a good chunk of the money, I'm aware of the inflation risk and want to secure a deal quickly.  Bob may be willing to accept this, as he's getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation risk is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and there's no guarantee that a better offer will come in the future."
