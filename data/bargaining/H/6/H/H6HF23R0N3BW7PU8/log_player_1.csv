Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  I'm starting off with a generous offer, hoping to secure the deal in the first round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still a good deal for me.  I'll take the $500,000 and end this game."
