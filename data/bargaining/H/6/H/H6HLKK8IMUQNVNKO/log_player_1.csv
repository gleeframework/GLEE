Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome.  Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains any further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
It's tempting to try and squeeze a little more out of Bob, but the longer the game goes on, the more we both lose due to inflation. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point ensures we both walk away with a reasonable amount."
