Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a more equitable split given the  inflation rates we're facing. I'm proposing we split it 60/40 in my favor, reflecting the slower rate at which my money depreciates. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
