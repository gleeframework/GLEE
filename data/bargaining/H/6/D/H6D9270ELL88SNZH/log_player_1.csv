"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm leaving room for future negotiations if Bob wants to try to get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fairer, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I think 49% is a bit too low for me. I'd rather not accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more than 49. I'll make a counteroffer next round.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55 is a fairer split. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55% this round, hoping to get a better deal while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
