Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider this carefully, as the money will be worth less in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  We both lose if this drags on. I'm willing to compromise slightly from my initial offer. This is your chance to secure a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's end this. I'm not sure I'll get a better deal, and we're both losing money with each round."
