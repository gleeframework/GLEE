"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the total amount, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle!

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to give up 60% of the total amount, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Fair and square, Bob. Let's split it down the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
