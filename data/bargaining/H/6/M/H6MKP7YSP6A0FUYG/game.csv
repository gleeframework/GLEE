70.0,30.0,Let's make a deal! 70 for me and 30 for you seems fair considering the inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split. Let's be reasonable, time is running out for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. You're losing value with each round. I'm offering you 40 which is more than the 30 you would have gotten last round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this now.  Take it before inflation eats away at any potential gains for either of us.",Bob,4,
