"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since I'm the one making the first offer, I want to start with a slightly higher amount for myself, but still leave a substantial amount for Bob. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and cooperation, hoping that he'll see the offer as reasonable and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is better for you in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he claims it's better for me in the long run, the immediate value I receive is still lower than what I offered him in the first round. Considering the 20% inflation that has already reduced the value of the money I would gain, accepting 4500 now would be even less valuable to me than the original 4000 I offered to Bob. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round or get closer to the original amount I proposed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}

I'm offering a slightly lower amount for myself than in the first round, trying to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an invitation for Bob to compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a very fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob claims his offer is very fair considering the inflation, I still find the amount offered to me to be less than what I was aiming for, especially after adjusting for the significant reduction in value due to inflation. At this point, the money I would gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, making the 4900 offered by Bob even less valuable in real terms. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement in the next rounds, despite the risk of further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money I would gain.

{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Consider the future value""}

At this point, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's understanding of the situation, highlighting that the value of the money I would gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. By offering 5600 to myself, I'm attempting to secure a slightly better deal that compensates for the loss in value, while still leaving a substantial amount for Bob. The message ""Consider the future value"" is a reminder to Bob that the real value of the money is changing over time, and that accepting a deal now might be more beneficial for both of us than risking further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is as close to even as it's going to get. Take it before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","Despite Bob's message that this is as close to even as it's going to get, I'm considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money I would gain. At this point, the money I would gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, making the 4950 offered by Bob substantially less valuable in real terms. However, given the rapid decrease in value and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, I might be inclined to accept this offer to secure some value, even if it's not the best deal I had hoped for.
