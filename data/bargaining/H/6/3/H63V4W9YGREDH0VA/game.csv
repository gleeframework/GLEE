45.0,55.0,"I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation hits you harder.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This offer gets us closer to a fair split while there's still a good amount left.",Alice,3,

42.0,58.0,"Inflation is indeed a factor, but I believe my share should be higher considering it affects you more.",Bob,4,
