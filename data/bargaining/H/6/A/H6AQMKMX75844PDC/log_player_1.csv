Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly.  It's a small amount for him, but a lot for me in the long run, especially considering inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer to keep more, accepting this offer guarantees me at least half the money, and with inflation it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing in future rounds."
