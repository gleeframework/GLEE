"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing if I reject his offer in the next round.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm willing to take a risk for a larger share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation hit me hard, it's still better to accept this offer. If I reject it, I risk getting nothing in the next round as the inflation continues to erode the value of the money."
