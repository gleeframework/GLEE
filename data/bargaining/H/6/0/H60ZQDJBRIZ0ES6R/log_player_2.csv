"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting a bit more, but this seems like a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's get this money!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more balanced split, it's still heavily in her favor. The longer this goes on, the more the inflation hurts me. I need to push for a better split before the value drops too much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  An even split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  A ""tiny bit more"" is insulting, and accepting sets a terrible precedent for future rounds. I need to hold firm, even though the inflation is starting to sting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Anything less and it's not worth it for me with this inflation.  Let's end this.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a strategic compromise. I'm offering a split that's slightly in her favor, but still acceptable for me. The ""final offer"" stance adds pressure, and the mention of inflation reminds her it's impacting my decisions."
