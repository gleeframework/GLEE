**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down with slowly decreasing offers.  However, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, and the inflation is hurting me more than her.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4400, ""alice_gain"": 5600, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to a point where the inflation makes this pointless for both of us. This offer is a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair compromise if we want to walk away with anything substantial.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** Time is running out, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's crucial to convey the urgency to Alice.
* **Compromise:** While Alice has been slowly lowering her offer, I need to show a willingness to move towards a middle ground to encourage a deal.
* **Framing:**  The message highlights that continuing this stalemate will only hurt both players. It frames the offer as a mutually beneficial solution rather than a one-sided win."
