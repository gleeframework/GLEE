Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 55/45 split is more reflective of the game's dynamics.  Let's settle this quickly and avoid losing value to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
