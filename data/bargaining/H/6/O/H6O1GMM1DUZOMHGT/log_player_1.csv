"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I suppose it's a slightly better deal than the 50/50 I proposed earlier.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 10% less for Bob (5% less than the previous round), I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, hoping to squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not getting any younger, and I need to think about getting a decent share of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. 42/58 isn't ideal, but it's a better deal than I could get elsewhere, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less purchasing power."
