# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping inflation will erode my position and force me to accept a worse deal. However, she's consistently offering me less than my fair share.  I need to show some firmness, but I also need to be mindful of the shrinking pot. I'll reject this offer and aim for a more balanced split in the next round."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is really turning up the pressure, and this offer is tempting given the circumstances. However, accepting it would mean settling for significantly less than half the pot. I'm willing to gamble that she'll crack under pressure before I do. I need to hold strong for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and inflation is steadily eroding my potential gains. Alice is clearly committed to a strategy of attrition, hoping I'll cave to her increasingly lopsided offers.  It's time to draw a line in the sand.  A 50/50 split is fair, and by presenting it as a non-negotiable ultimatum, I'm maximizing the pressure on Alice to accept before we both lose everything to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have accepted earlier, now I'm taking more 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging from her strategy, and this offer, while bad, is still better than nothing. With only three rounds left and inflation eating away at my potential gains, holding out any longer would be incredibly risky. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting this offer ensures I at least walk away with something."
