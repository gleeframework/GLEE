**Reasoning:**

While this offer is less favorable than Alice's initial offer, it's the best she's likely to get at this point.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for Alice. Waiting longer means she'll get even less.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob seems anchored to the 60/40 split, rejecting all of Alice's attempts to get more. He's betting on Alice caving due to the time pressure. 

Accepting now secures Alice a reasonable sum, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
