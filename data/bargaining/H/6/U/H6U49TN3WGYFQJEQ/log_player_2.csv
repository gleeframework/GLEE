Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I'm not backing down. My offer is still more generous than yours, considering the inflation. You're losing value with each passing round, so think carefully. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a tough game, but I'm not desperate yet.  A 43/57 split is still too far in her favor, especially with the inflation working against me. I need to show her I'm serious about walking away if necessary."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a very reasonable 47/53 split.  Take it now, or I'm walking away. This is my absolute final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to lay down the law.  Continuously offering slightly better deals isn't working. I'm making a small concession by increasing my offer to 470,000, but my tone is firm. This should signal to Alice that I'm serious about walking away and that she risks getting nothing if she continues to play hardball."
