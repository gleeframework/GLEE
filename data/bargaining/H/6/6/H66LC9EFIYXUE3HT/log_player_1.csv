Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. I'm willing to give you $40 now, but next round the money will be worth less to you! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
