"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to negotiate from here 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving away 70% of the total amount, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
