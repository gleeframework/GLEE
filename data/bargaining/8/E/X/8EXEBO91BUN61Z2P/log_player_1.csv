"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you'll have to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation.

Since the money is worth 20% less, my $300,000 gain is actually worth 80% of the original amount, which is $240,000.

I'm not sure if I want to compromise this much, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (due to 2 rounds of 20% inflation), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need a better deal to account for inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% of its original value now, my $450,000 gain is actually worth $219,600.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a compromise, but it's getting closer to what I initially wanted. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
