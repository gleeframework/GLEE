"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob will accept and we can finish the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a generous offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take the majority, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I'll reject his offer for now and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's offer being 60/40, I'm thinking of offering a more balanced split to see if Bob will accept.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
