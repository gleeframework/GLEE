I'll offer Alice a slightly lower share, hoping she'll accept before the inflation kicks in."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is getting greedy. I'll try to negotiate again."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

I'll offer Alice an even split.  It's the fairest option, and hopefully, it will convince her to accept before the inflation makes things worse."
