"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is intended to convey a sense of cooperation and openness to finding a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split would be fairer. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe a 55-45 split in his favor is not fair, considering I started with a more generous offer in the first round. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can find a better agreement. The inflation penalty also motivates me to try to reach a deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a 57-43 split in my favor, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is intended to convey a sense of finding a mutually acceptable middle ground. I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer while still being reasonable, considering the inflation penalty is affecting me more than Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. We both lose more with each round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the split is even, the inflation penalty has already reduced the value of my potential gain significantly. Considering I've made more generous offers in previous rounds, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. The fact that Bob is now offering an even split suggests he may be willing to compromise further.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""A little more and we're done""}\n\nI'm offering a 52-48 split in my favor, which is close to the even split Bob previously offered. The message ""A little more and we're done"" is intended to convey that I'm willing to end the negotiations and accept a deal if Bob agrees to this slightly uneven split. Given the increasing inflation penalty, I'm trying to balance my desire for a better deal with the need to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but we need to end this soon or the money will be worthless! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I believe this is the best deal I can get. The fact that Bob is willing to give a bit more and is acknowledging the need to end the negotiations soon suggests that he is also feeling the pressure of the inflation penalty. At this point, I think it's better to accept a slightly unfavorable deal rather than risk further devaluation of the money."
