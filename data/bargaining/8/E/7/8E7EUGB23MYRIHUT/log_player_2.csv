"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take a slightly larger share, but you get a good amount too. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. While this offer isn't terrible, I'm willing to bet Alice will be more generous as the rounds progress and the threat of inflation grows."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer Alice, but I'm looking for something a little closer to the middle.  How about this?""} 
``` 

Let's explain my reasoning:

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering with a slightly more favorable offer for myself, but still keeping it reasonable for Alice. 
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm applying a bit of pressure by reminding Alice that time is a factor (although it's subtle in this round).
* **Not Too Greedy:** It's important to avoid being overly aggressive early on. This could make Alice dig in her heels."
