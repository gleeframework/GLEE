"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Losing 10% value each round isn't ideal, but accepting 10% of the original value right off the bat doesn't seem like the best starting point for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that seems more reasonable, considering the decreasing value of money for me. I'll aim for a larger share to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 40,
""alice_gain"": 60,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 40% for me is a fair starting point. Let's negotiate from here.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is my final offer.  If you reject this, we'll both lose more in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the inflation and Alice's unwillingness to budge much, accepting 30% now might be the best option before the value decreases further. Continuing to reject offers risks significant loss due to inflation, and Alice's message suggests she might not offer more in subsequent rounds."
