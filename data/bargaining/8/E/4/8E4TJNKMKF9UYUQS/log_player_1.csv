"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm starting by offering Bob a very small portion of the money. I'm hoping that he'll be rational and realize that it's better to take a small amount now than risk getting nothing in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a good deal for me!  I get a decent share, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
