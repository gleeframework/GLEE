"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair at face value, I need to prioritize my own gains, especially considering the inflation factor.  A 40/60 split in her favor isn't ideal. I'm willing to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Prioritize early gains:** The inflation rate makes each round crucial.  A slightly advantageous split now is better than a potentially better deal later that's been diminished by inflation.
* **Appear reasonable:**  A 55/45 split shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want a significant share. 
* **Time pressure:**  Alice knows the clock is ticking. This offer, while not overly aggressive, might persuade her to settle rather than risk getting a worse deal in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to wear me down, but her counteroffer is unacceptable.  The inflation is eating into my potential gains significantly, and her ""slightly better"" offer doesn't even come close to making up for the losses I'm incurring with each passing round.  I need to hold firm and aim for a much better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time is running out! This is a fair deal, let's close this and both walk away with something substantial.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my demand slightly to show flexibility, but it's still heavily in my favor considering the inflation. 
* **Urgency:** Emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation might push Alice to accept.  
* **Fairness Appeal:**  While strategically positioned, framing the offer as ""fair"" could make Alice more receptive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a dangerous game, but I need to stay strong. She's clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor, knowing my potential gains are rapidly decreasing. However, accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping she'll start to feel the pressure in the next couple of rounds and propose a fairer deal. I still have a few rounds before the inflation makes accepting almost any offer the most logical choice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic: 50/50 is the fairest split.  Don't let greed make us both lose!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchor to Fairness:** With time running out, shifting to a strong fairness argument might be more persuasive than focusing solely on my diminishing returns. 
* **Prevent Total Loss:** It's getting risky. While not ideal, a 50/50 split guarantees I get something, which is looking better than nothing as the rounds progress. 
* **Appeal to Alice's Logic:** By highlighting the risk of ""greed,"" I'm implying she'll lose everything if she keeps pushing for a heavily skewed split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 is fair, but I have the upper hand 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is openly acknowledging my position of weakness but isn't offering any real compromise. While the inflation is getting severe, accepting a 35/65 split at this stage would be a huge loss. I need to show I'm still willing to walk away, hoping she'll get cold feet as we get closer to round 12.  There's a chance she'll make a less insulting offer next round rather than risk getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""This is my final concession.  Agree to this, or we both risk leaving with nothing. Don't be foolish.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Stand:** I need to signal that this is a serious offer, close to my breaking point.  
* **Slight Retreat, Strategic Positioning:** Offering 45/55 is still a loss compared to earlier rounds, but it's better than anything Alice has proposed so far.
* **Fear of Loss:** Emphasize the very real risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12. Alice might be stubborn, but she's not irrational. 
* **Direct Language:**  No more playing around. The message is blunt to make her understand the gravity of the situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of options, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It pains me to accept this, but Alice is playing hardball, and time is no longer on my side. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** With each round, my potential gains are decimated.  Waiting any longer could mean accepting an even worse offer, potentially even less than what I'm getting now.
* **Alice's Unwavering Stance:**  She's been consistently demanding a larger share and doesn't seem fazed by the approaching deadline. This suggests she's willing to risk it all, making her offer in this round the likely ""high point"" for me.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  While $3,000 is far from ideal, it's still something.  If I reject this and she doesn't budge, we both walk away with nothing.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but I need to be pragmatic at this stage."
