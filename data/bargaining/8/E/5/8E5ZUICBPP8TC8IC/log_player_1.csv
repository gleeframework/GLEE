"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the next offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is $160,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $760,000.

While I'm not thrilled about the offer, it's still a decent chunk of money. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons. Since I'll have to make the next offer, I might as well accept this one and try to negotiate a better deal next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
