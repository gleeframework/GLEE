**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, accepting this offer would be a mistake. Alice is clearly playing a game, trying to wear Bob down. She's betting that Bob will panic as the rounds go on and accept a bad deal. It's time for Bob to show some resolve and push back harder."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alright, you're tough. This is a serious offer, let's end this before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for Bob to show some flexibility, but not too much.  This offer:

* **Acknowledges Alice's position:** It gives Alice slightly more than half, recognizing her stronger position due to the inflation disadvantage Bob faces. 
* **Remains firm:** Bob is not giving in completely. This offer still secures him a decent amount, even with the inflation. 
* **Communicates urgency:** The message emphasizes the need to settle quickly for both their benefits. 

Hopefully, this offer will convince Alice to take the deal before inflation eats away at Bob's potential gains even further."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think you're getting desperate, let's see how low you'll go 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one. Alice is clearly being ruthless, but time is working against us. Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** Bob gets $3500. It's a significant loss compared to earlier rounds, but still something.
* **Rejecting:** There's a real chance Bob will get a worse offer later. The worst-case scenario is both lose everything.

Considering the circumstances, and Alice's relentless approach, Bob needs to cut his losses. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's painful, but better to walk away with something than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds. Alice has proven she's willing to push Bob to the brink, and it's unlikely her strategy will change."
