"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since we have 12 rounds, I figure I can afford to be generous in the early stages.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking this deal and getting some money now, rather than risk it all and potentially get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, and I'm not willing to accept that. It's clear that Bob is playing a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob. I'm hoping this will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still securing a large share for myself.  I'm also hoping that the risk of further inflation will motivate Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my previous offer, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  However, I'm not going to give in yet.  I'm hoping I can get him to settle for a more even split before the inflation becomes too extreme."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to try to hold firm and maintain my dominance in this negotiation.  I'm reducing my offer further, but I'm still offering a considerable amount to Bob.  I'm hoping that the risk of inflation and the possibility of getting nothing will convince Bob to accept this offer."
