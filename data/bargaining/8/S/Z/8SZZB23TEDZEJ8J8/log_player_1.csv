"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game, where I am attempting to maximize my gain by offering Bob a small amount, hoping he will accept it rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bigger share, it's better to accept the 50/50 split.  The inflation means the money I'd get by rejecting and proposing in the next round would be significantly less. It's not ideal, but it's the most rational decision given the circumstances."
