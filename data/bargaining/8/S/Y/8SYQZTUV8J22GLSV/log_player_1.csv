"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose to keep the majority of the money and give Bob only $1. This is a risky move, but it might incentivize Bob to accept and avoid risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to accept this offer.  While I would prefer more money, it's a fair split, and rejecting it risks getting nothing in the end."
