"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll start with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of inflation and see if I can get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm adjusting my offer to be more aggressive, considering the inflation risk and Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping to secure a deal before inflation further reduces the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, I believe it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer.  The potential for further inflation and a possible worse outcome in the next round outweighs the chance of getting a slightly better deal."
