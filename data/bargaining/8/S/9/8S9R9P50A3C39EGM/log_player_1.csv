"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is not in the format I expected, but I'll assume it's correct.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Since the money was worth 80% of its original value in round 2, it's now worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).

My offer is:
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5120,
  ""bob_gain"": 4880
}"
