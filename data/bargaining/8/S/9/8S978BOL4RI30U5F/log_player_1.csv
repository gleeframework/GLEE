"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not fair, considering the inflation that has devalued my potential gain. I'll reject this and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this round, hoping to find a middle ground.  Since the money is worth less for me now, I'm trying to secure a larger chunk before the value drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unacceptable.  While it's an improvement from the last round, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share. I need to push for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm again offering a larger share to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept. With each round, the value of my share is decreasing, so I need to compromise a little to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than the last round, it still isn't fair considering the significant inflation I'm facing. I need to keep negotiating for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than the previous round, aiming for a compromise. However, with inflation eating away at my gains, I'm still pushing for a bigger portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it still doesn't reflect the significant inflation I've been facing. I'm determined to push for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob again, aiming to reach a compromise. However, time is running out, and the value of my share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'm hoping to find a solution soon before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only a few rounds left and inflation hitting hard, it's time to accept a compromise.  While I would prefer more, Bob's offer is the best I can hope for at this point. It's better than getting nothing at all!"
