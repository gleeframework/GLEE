Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the time value of money with inflation.  It's a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 70/30. This is my final offer before the inflation hits again. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting me more with each round, but I'm willing to gamble another round to try and secure a better deal.  Alice's mention of a ""final offer"" could be a bluff, and even if it's not, I might be able to get her closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
