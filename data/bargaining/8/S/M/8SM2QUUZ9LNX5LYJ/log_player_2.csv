Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting silly.  We're both losing money with every round that passes. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
