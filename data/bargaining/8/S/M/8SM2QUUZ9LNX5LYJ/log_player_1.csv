Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can do better than that. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Remember, inflation is hitting you twice as hard as me, so let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
