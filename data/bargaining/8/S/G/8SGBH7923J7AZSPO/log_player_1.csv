"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share of the money, but leaves Bob with something. This is a good starting point to see how he reacts and whether he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the 20% inflation, this is a good deal for me.  I'm getting half the money, which is better than the risk of continuing and potentially getting nothing in the future."
