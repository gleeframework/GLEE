"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about getting less than half, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

For now, I'll decide to:
