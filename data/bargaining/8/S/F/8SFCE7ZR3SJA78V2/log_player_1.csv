Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In this round, my gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.
