"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money I gain in the first round, which is $5000. Bob's offer is $4000, which is less than $5000, but since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider it as $4000 / 0.95 = $4210.53 in the first round's value.

However, I'll also consider the total amount Bob is offering, which is $6000, and its value in the first round is $6000 / 0.95 = $6315.79.

I'll reject the offer since I can potentially get a higher value in future rounds.
