"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the inflation that will kick in with each passing round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's move towards that. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about the new offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 45-55 split. I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You said you wanted a more even split. I'm willing to give you the majority, but I'm not going to give up too much. Accept this and we can move forward!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor. I'm hoping he'll accept this and we can make progress towards dividing the money!"
