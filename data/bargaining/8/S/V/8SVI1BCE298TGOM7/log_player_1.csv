"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering you $100,000, which is a generous 10% of the total amount. If you accept, we can both walk away with a tidy sum. If you decline, I'll be back with an even more tempting offer in Round 2!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money equally. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, I would gain $500,000, which is still a significant amount, but it's worth 90% of what I would have gained in the first round. Considering the inflation, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to make my next proposal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer to a fair deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000, which is 30% of the total amount. I'm trying to be more generous this time, but I'm not giving away the whole pie just yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should aim for a more balanced distribution. This proposal splits the money fairly. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, I would gain $600,000, which is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth 72.9% of what he would have gained in the first round. This is a more balanced distribution, as Bob is getting a larger share, but I'm still getting a significant amount.

I think I can do better than this, but it's getting close. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to make my next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, Bob! You're getting a bigger share than before.""
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000, which is 45% of the total amount. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where we can both walk away happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 50-50 split would be fair. This proposal aims for equality. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, I would gain $525,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $475,000 is worth 59.05% of what he would have gained in the first round. This is a more equal split, but I'm still getting a slightly larger share.

Considering the inflation and the relative values, I think this is a good opportunity to accept the offer. I'll take the $525,000 and call it a day.
