Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer.  While it's better than nothing, it's too lopsided in Alice's favor.  I'll see what she offers in the next round, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair starting point, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to find a solution quickly to avoid the inflation effect."
