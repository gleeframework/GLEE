"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm not sure why you think this inflation is a good reason to take more money. Let's split the money more fairly this time, considering your advantage with the inflation. If you accept, we can both take home a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
