"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that the money is worth the same to both of us at this point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I think I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks he can do better, huh?

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob's offer is fair, considering the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'd like to see a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not falling for it! Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to balance out the effects of inflation and give Bob a slightly better deal. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think I'm taking advantage of inflation, but I'm just adapting to the changing landscape! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is adapting to the landscape, all right!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob's offer is a good deal, considering the money is worth significantly less for me now. I'd like to see a better offer from Bob that takes into account the effects of inflation on both of us!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, Bob! Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a fair deal considering the effects of inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
