"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money for myself, giving Bob just a small portion. Since there are many rounds to go, I want to secure the most value possible for myself while still offering something to Bob to potentially incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a high-stakes game, and I need to be strategic.  While accepting this offer would mean some immediate gain, the inflation rate is much more drastic for Bob than it is for me. By rejecting, I force him to propose again in the next round, and the value of his offer will decrease further due to the inflation rate. This gives me a better chance of securing a more favorable deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer for Bob, but still maintaining a significant portion of the money for myself. This is a strategic move to potentially incentivize Bob to accept while still securing a large share of the value. The inflation rate is working in my favor, and I want to avoid the risk of having to negotiate further down the line with a significantly reduced pot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although Bob's offer represents a significant increase in my share compared to the previous round, the inflation is hitting him much harder.  By rejecting, I'm putting pressure on him.  His offer will continue to decrease in value with each passing round due to the inflation, making a more favorable deal for me more likely in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm further increasing my offer for Bob, but still keeping a majority of the money for myself.  The inflation is strongly in my favor, and I'm trying to secure a deal before it decreases the value of the pot too much.  It's a gamble, but I believe this offer is balanced enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm still playing the long game. The inflation is hitting him much harder than me, and his offer will continue to decrease in value. By rejecting, I put the pressure back on him, forcing him to make a more favorable offer in the next round. I believe I can secure a larger share of the money with just a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer for Bob again, but still maintaining a comfortable lead.  The inflation is working in my favor, and I'm hoping this offer will be tempting enough for Bob to accept.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking pot, so I need to find a balance between securing a good deal and avoiding the risk of reaching the final rounds with a drastically reduced sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is tempting, I'm still playing the long game. The inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me.  If I accept this offer, the remaining rounds won't offer me much leverage to improve my share.  It's worth risking one more round to see if I can get a larger portion.  His offer will continue to decrease in value with each passing round, making a more favorable deal for me more likely in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is a high-stakes round. The pot is shrinking rapidly, and I need to find a balance between securing a fair deal and avoiding the risk of reaching the final rounds with a drastically reduced sum. This offer is a significant increase for Bob, and I'm hoping it's enough to tempt him into accepting. However, if he rejects, I need to be prepared for the possibility that the next round might not be as favorable."
