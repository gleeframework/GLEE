Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point. Let's try a more balanced split. I propose 4950 for me, and 5050 for you. This seems like a good compromise, given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5050 
# Alice gain: 4950
