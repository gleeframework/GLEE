"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I believe is a reasonable and generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. The message is a brief explanation of my reasoning, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice, but remember the money shrinks. I think this is a fair deal that lets us both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less, Bob's offer of $4,500 for me is actually equivalent to $3,600 in the first round, which is less than my initial offer to him. I'm hoping to get a better share in the next round, considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's split it closer to 50/50""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $4,500, while taking $5,500 for myself. Given the inflation, the total value of the money has decreased, so my offer is actually equivalent to $4,400 for Bob and $4,400 for me in the first round. I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by framing it as a near 50/50 split, considering the reduced value of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
