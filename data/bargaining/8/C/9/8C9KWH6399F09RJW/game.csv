4700.0,5300.0,"I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's end this before we both lose more money. I'll take a slightly bigger share, but we'll both be better off than if we keep going.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Inflation is really hurting your share now. I'm willing to take an even bigger share, but it's still better for you to accept now rather than lose even more in the next rounds.",Alice,7,
