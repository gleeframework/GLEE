"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my initial offer. I'll accept his offer.
