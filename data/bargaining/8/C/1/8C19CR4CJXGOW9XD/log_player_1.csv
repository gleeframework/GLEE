"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to keep a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of my potential gain has decreased, so I need to be more cautious.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my potential gain is now worth even less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher amount than his previous offer, but still keeping a bit more for myself. The message is a gentle push to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! With my potential gain worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to be more cautious.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with a smaller share than my previous offers, considering the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust my offer to account for the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, while still being willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway."
