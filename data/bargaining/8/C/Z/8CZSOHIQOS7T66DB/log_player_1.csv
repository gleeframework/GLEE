Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept. I'll keep most of the money for myself, but I'll give him a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to agree.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have more, it's clear that Bob is willing to split the money evenly.  With each round, the value of my share decreases, so accepting this offer is the best course of action."
