"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the total is now 8,000$.

Here's my offer for round 2:
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, the total is now 6,400$.

Alice's offer in round 3 is 3000$ for me, which is 46.88% of the total (3000/6,400).

I'll accept this offer.
