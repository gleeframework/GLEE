"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split, which is a relatively even split of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  A 50/50 split is the most logical way to start.  No need to keep playing if we can agree! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal. It's a fair and straightforward way to divide the remaining $100. I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
