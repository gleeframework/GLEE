Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time. This is a fair split considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my higher inflation rate. While the offer seems tempting as time runs out, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold firm and show I'm serious about getting a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. The value is dropping rapidly. I propose a 50/50 split - it's the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""}

**Reasoning:**

At this stage, with the inflation rate escalating, a 50/50 split is the most logical. It sends a clear message that I'm not going to be lowballed and emphasizes the urgency of the situation. Alice is running out of time to secure a larger share, and this offer might be her last chance to avoid losing everything."
