I'll start with a very lopsided offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and accept it, ending the game quickly.  I don't want to risk inflation eating away at my potential gains!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. Even though it's incredibly unfair, I'm not going to give up $999,998 for just $1. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."

{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Although the inflation is hitting him harder, he's still offering me a tiny amount compared to his own gain. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round."

I'm making a significant jump in my offer this time, giving Bob 1,000 dollars.  Inflation is likely hitting him hard now, and this generous offer might be enough to convince him to accept.  I'm willing to give up a larger portion of the money to ensure a quick and favorable resolution."
