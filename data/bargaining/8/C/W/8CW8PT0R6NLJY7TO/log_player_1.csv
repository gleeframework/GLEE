"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the starting point of $10,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to give you a better deal if you wait a few more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less this round, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the proposal.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think I'll accept Bob's offer this time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
