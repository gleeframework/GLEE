"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and I'll give you a chance to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both get a decent amount, and we can avoid the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to kick in!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for a 50-50 split just yet. I'd like to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation risk.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than the even split, but I need to protect myself from inflation too.  Let's settle this now before the money continues to lose value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd like to try to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The pressure is on!

Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a larger share given the original amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
