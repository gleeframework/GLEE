"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to accept a smaller share due to the 5% inflation.

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 40 dollars, which is still a decent share, and we can finalize the game."
