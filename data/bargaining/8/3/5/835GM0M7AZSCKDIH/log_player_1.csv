"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60% of the original $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4800 in the original terms.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a little more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of either! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the equivalent value of my gain in the original terms...

My gain of $4500 is worth 52.2% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $5220 in the original terms.

Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 55% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $5500 in the original terms.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer...
