I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself as the first proposer. I'll see if Bob is willing to accept this, or if he wants to risk the next round where the money will be worth less for him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is worse for me than the 90/10 split I proposed in the first round.  I'll reject and hope for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to propose an 80/20 split. This is a bit less than the 90/10 I offered in the first round, but I have to take into account that the money is now worth less for both of us. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in this deal."
