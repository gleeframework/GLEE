"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll get the smaller share, but I'll be happy with it.""
}
```

I'm offering to take the smaller share of 60% ($6,000) and leaving Bob with 40% ($4,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth 90% of that, or $5,400, and Bob's $4,000 is now worth 80% of that, or $3,200.

However, Bob's new offer is for a 50-50 split, which means I would get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000.

I'll accept this offer.
