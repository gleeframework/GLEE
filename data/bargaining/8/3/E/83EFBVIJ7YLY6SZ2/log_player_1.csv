"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and take $600,000 for myself, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's share. It's a generous offer that should incentivize Bob to accept, given the decreasing value of money for him in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a more balanced split. Let's aim for something fairer this time around. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because it doesn't take into account the impact of inflation on his share. Given that his money is worth 20% less in this round, his proposed $600,000 is actually equivalent to $480,000 in real value, while I'd be getting $400,000. This isn't a fair split, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account that Bob's share is worth 20% less due to inflation in the first round, and another 20% less in this round. To make the offer more appealing, I'll increase Bob's share while considering the real value of the money for him.\n\n### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a better deal for you""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000, which, considering the inflation, is a better deal than the previous offers, and I'll take $550,000 for myself. This offer is more generous and should incentivize Bob to accept, given the decreasing value of money for him in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  I think this is the most fair way to go about it, given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, although it seems like a fair split at first glance, it doesn't account for the significant impact of inflation on his share. Given that his money is worth 48.8% less in this round, his proposed $500,000 is actually equivalent to approximately $256,000 in real value, while I'd be getting $500,000. This isn't a fair split considering the real value of the money, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account that Bob's share is worth 48.8% less due to inflation. To make the offer more appealing, I'll increase Bob's share while considering the real value of the money for him. Since Bob's previous offer was to split it down the middle, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to incentivize him to accept.\n\n### {""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation impact, this is a generous offer""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $480,000, which, considering the inflation, is a better deal than the previous offers, and I'll take $520,000 for myself. This offer is more generous and should incentivize Bob to accept, given the decreasing value of money for him in subsequent rounds."
