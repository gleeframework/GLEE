# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer is generous, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair, and we both have a better chance of getting something if we work together.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you want to split it down the middle, but considering the inflation, I think I should get a bit more to make up for the loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of inflation to get a larger share. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give up that much. I'll reject and see if she's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to budge a bit more, but I still think 50/50 is the fairest split.  Let's compromise and find a solution we can both agree on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, considering the increasing inflation, I think I should get a bit more to offset the loss in value. Let's try to meet in the middle, but slightly in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is more fair now, considering the inflation.  While I'd prefer an even split, accepting this offer gives me something and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
