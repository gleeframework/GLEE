**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly inching closer to a more even split, but time is working against me more than her.  I need to hold out for a better offer and hope she starts getting nervous about running out of rounds."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer, now I'm less willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now moving in the wrong direction, and the effects of inflation are getting severe. If I reject this offer and she doesn't offer more in the next round, I'll be forced to take even less to avoid getting nothing. It's too risky to continue, so accepting this offer is the best option I have."
