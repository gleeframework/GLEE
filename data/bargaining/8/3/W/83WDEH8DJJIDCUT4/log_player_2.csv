"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split is beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, the inflation factor makes it much less appealing to me. By rejecting, I get to make the next proposal and leverage the inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be more realistic. This offer is better for both of us considering the inflation. Accept it and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise considering the inflation. It's important to find a fair deal quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, this offer is a decent compromise. Given the inflation rate, my share would be significantly reduced if we continue to reject offers. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk losing more later."
