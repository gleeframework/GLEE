"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a bold strategy here. I'm offering Bob the smallest possible amount to see if he's willing to take it.  If not, I'll be the one making the offer in the next round and I can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is clearly a power move by Bob. I'm not going to let him get away with taking almost everything.  I'll be the one making the offer next, and I'll try to be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time I'm offering an even split.  It's fair and avoids further negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
