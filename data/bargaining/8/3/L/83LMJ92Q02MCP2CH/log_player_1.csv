Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. We're both losing money by dragging this out. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Bob's potential offers is decreasing with each round due to inflation. While my potential gains remain static, his are steadily shrinking. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 is very risky. There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything close to this amount, and the value will further decrease. 
* **Finality:** Bob explicitly stated this is his final offer.  This carries weight as it suggests he's unlikely to budge further.

While I could push for a slightly higher amount in a counter-offer, the risk of ending up with a significantly worse deal in a later round is too high. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable sum, even if it's not the optimal outcome."
