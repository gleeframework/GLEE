"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I propose a 5500/4500 split, giving me a slight advantage but still leaving Bob with a fair share. I believe this is a good starting point for a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice.  With each round, the value of the money decreases, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
