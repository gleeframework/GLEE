"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering you 90% of the money, Bob. This is a good deal for you since you'll still get 10%.  Let's get this game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the inflation rate means the next round will be even worse."
