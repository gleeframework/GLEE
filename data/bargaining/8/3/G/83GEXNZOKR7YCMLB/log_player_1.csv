"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make this quick, Alice. My offer is more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate, Bob, but your offer was too low. This seems fairer considering the time pressure.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice.  I'm meeting you in the middle with this offer. Let's settle this and both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the time pressure is mounting, Bob's offer is still severely skewed in his favor. Accepting now would mean settling for less than half the original value due to inflation. I need to show firmness to push him towards a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm offering you a fair deal considering the circumstances. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm mirroring Bob's previous offer but shifting the advantage slightly in my favor. By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I aim to increase pressure on him to accept. This minimizes further losses from inflation while still aiming for a larger share."
