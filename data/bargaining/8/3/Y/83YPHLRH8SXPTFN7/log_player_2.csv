"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take $6000 and you'll receive $4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a fair split now, I know that inflation will eat away at my share. I'm hoping to get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Inflation is a factor, and I think this is a fair offer considering the future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe a 50/50 split is fair, considering the inflation and the remaining rounds. Both of us would receive equal shares of $5000. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting hard.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.  It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
