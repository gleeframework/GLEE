"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I want to accept Bob's offer just yet. I was hoping for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too low for my taste, I'll make a new proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm proposing that I get 55 dollars and Bob gets 45 dollars. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and getting a decent share myself."
