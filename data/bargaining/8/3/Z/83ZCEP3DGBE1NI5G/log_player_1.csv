Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise. It acknowledges the time pressure while still offering us a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for you (Alice). Accepting $600,000 now is better than risking a worse offer in the next round where the value would decrease even further. 
* **Bob's Position:** Bob knows you are experiencing inflation and is likely to propose even less favorable offers in subsequent rounds. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees you a reasonable sum. Rejecting it brings uncertainty and the potential for a much lower payout in the end."
