"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation affects you more than me. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation affects me more, I think a 60/40 split is a reasonable compromise. However, I'd like to negotiate a bit further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider a 55/45 split, but 60/40 is still a bit steep for me.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway between 50/50 and 60/40. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
