Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I'm not sure ""fair"" is the same for both of us, given the inflation rates."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

We're getting closer, but I still think we can do better.  The inflation is really hitting hard, and I don't want to be left with too little.  Let's keep talking!"
