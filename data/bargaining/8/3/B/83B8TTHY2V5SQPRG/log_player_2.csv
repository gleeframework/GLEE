Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold my ground a little longer. While the inflation is hurting, accepting a deal where I get significantly less isn't palatable. There's a chance she'll offer a better deal as the rounds progress and she sees I'm not going to cave easily."
