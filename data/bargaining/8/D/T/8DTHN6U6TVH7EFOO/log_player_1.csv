"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm more willing to accept a more even split. I accept Bob's offer.
