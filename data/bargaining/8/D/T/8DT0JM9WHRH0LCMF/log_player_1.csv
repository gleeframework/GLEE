"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going for a slightly unfair split, but I want to maximize my gains in the first round, knowing the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the money is now worth less due to inflation. It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure 85% of the money."
