"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob.  Take this as a starting point for a fair negotiation.  Let's see what you think! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round. Alice's offer is not fair, and I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what I can propose in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice! This is a fair offer considering we both want a good deal.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that is closer to a 50/50 split, considering the 5% inflation that will occur in each round. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this. I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I think this split is more fair.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's get this settled. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer from round 3. Although she has moved closer to my previous offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. With the inflation rate in mind, I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round to try and get a more favorable split. Let's see what I can propose next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference between our last two offers. We're both losing money, so it's time to meet in the middle and finalize the deal.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that splits the difference between Alice's last offer and my previous one. Considering the inflation, I believe this is a fair and reasonable proposal. I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in meeting in the middle and accept this offer to avoid further losses. Let's see how she responds!"
