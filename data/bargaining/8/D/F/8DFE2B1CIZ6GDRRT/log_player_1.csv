"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a respectable 40% of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the effects of inflation, my share is worth even less now. I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the increasing effects of inflation, I'll aim for a more significant share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains! Given the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be careful. However, Bob's offer is quite one-sided, and I'm not sure if I can afford to reject it. I'll accept his offer from Round 4.
