"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob will get 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more. You can't expect to get 80% of the pie, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'm not impressed by his ""generous"" offer. Considering the money is now worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was too low, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 80% of the pie, Bob. How about we split it 60-40 in my favor?""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the remaining $9,000 (after inflation), which is $5,400, and Bob will get 40%, which is $3,600."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet! I'll meet you in the middle with a 50-50 split. It's the fairest way to divide the remaining pie. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split sounds like a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'd rather try to negotiate further.

However, I'm not willing to reject this offer outright, as it's a relatively fair split. I'll accept this offer, but I'm keeping an eye on the future rounds to see if I can get a better deal.
