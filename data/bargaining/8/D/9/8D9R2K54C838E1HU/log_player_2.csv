Let's see what Alice offers next. I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly worse deal than she offered me, hoping she'll accept it to avoid risking getting nothing later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair offer and it's better to take it now than risk getting nothing later."
