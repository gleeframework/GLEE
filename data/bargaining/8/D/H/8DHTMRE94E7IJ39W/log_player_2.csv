I'm going to reject the offer.  While it's fair, I know that the money will be worth less in later rounds, and I want to try to get a bigger share."

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject.  While Alice is trying to be more accommodating, I'm betting on getting a better deal in the future. The money is worth less with each round, so I need to be patient and try to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm increasing my share again. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also confident that I can get a better deal if we keep going.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to balance our gains while acknowledging the inflation impact. I hope this proposal will lead to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The inflation is starting to take a serious toll, and I need to start taking offers seriously.  Alice's offer is closer to what I was aiming for, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we continue."
