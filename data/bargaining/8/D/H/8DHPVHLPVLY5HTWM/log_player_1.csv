"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering to take 70% of the $100, leaving Bob with 30%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully. Since the offer is still quite close to the original 70-30 split, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer, I'll accept Bob's offer.
