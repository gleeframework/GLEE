"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40. It's a good deal for you right now, as the value of the money decreases over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than your initial offer. Since the money is worth less to you in each round, I'll take a bit more. Let's split it 55-45.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less the money is worth to me. I'll take $55, you take $45.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me in every round, I have no incentive to rush into a deal. Alice, on the other hand, is losing value over time. I'll wait for a better offer or try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I see you're getting desperate. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I'll take a bigger share. You should accept this offer before the value drops even further for you.""}"
