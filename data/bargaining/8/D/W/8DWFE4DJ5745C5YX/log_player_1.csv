"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one getting the better end of it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $320,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is still worth $600,000.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but don't think I'm going soft! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up to me! With the 48.8% reduction, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth $156,240.

I'll reject this offer. I'm not getting a good deal, and I need to try to negotiate a better one.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not desperate, but I'm willing to compromise. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
