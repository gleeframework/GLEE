"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $55, leaving Bob with $45. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that this division is reasonable and that prolonging the game will only result in both of us losing value due to inflation. By accepting this offer, Bob would avoid further depreciation of the money, which affects him more significantly.\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both with a good share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation reducing the value of the money for both of us, his proposed division seems unfair to me. By giving him $60 and me $40, Bob is not only getting a larger share but is also not significantly motivated to compromise due to his higher loss from inflation. Rejecting this offer gives me the chance to propose a more balanced division in the next round, potentially leveraging the increasing loss Bob faces from inflation to negotiate a better deal.\n\nPlease proceed to Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Compromise before it's too late""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, considering the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, I propose a slightly more favorable offer to Bob than my initial one, while still maintaining a larger share for myself. The message ""Compromise before it's too late"" aims to emphasize the mutual loss we're facing due to inflation and the benefits of settling on a division sooner rather than later. By accepting this offer, Bob would secure a significant amount before the value of the money depreciates further, especially considering his higher rate of loss.\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
