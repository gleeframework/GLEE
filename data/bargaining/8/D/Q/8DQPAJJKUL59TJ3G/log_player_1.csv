"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me getting 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will be affecting us in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm proposing a split of 850,000 for me and 150,000 for Bob.  I'm lowering my share to account for inflation, but I still believe this is a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting much less than what I initially wanted, the inflation is making it difficult to hold out for a better deal.  It's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all."
