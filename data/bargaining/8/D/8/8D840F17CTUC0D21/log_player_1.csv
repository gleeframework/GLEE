Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to try and get the maximum amount possible, so I'm offering Bob a very small share.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing."
