Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. We're running out of time and losing serious money. Don't be foolish. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation, it's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing at all. The chances of getting a better offer from Alice are slim, and the inflation is making things worse for both of us.  It's time to take what I can get."
