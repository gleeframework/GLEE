"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can always negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm willing to meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $2,700.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed, especially since Bob's gain is significantly higher. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair split""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to find a mutually acceptable solution."
