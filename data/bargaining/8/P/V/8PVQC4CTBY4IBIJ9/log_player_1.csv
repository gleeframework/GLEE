"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's better than nothing. I'm keeping the majority of the money, $8,000, for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to set the tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, Alice. I'll meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not sure if he's serious. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'm not willing to give up $3,000 just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to meet me in the middle, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more aggressive. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You said meet in the middle, but I think I'm the one who's been generous so far!""
}
```

I'm keeping a bit more for myself, but still giving Bob a decent chunk of the money. The message is a bit cheeky, trying to remind Bob that I'm the one who's been making concessions so far."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you're generous? I'll show you what generosity looks like! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me! He's making a bold offer, but I'm not sure if it's a genuine attempt to be generous or just a way to make me feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'm not comfortable giving Bob the majority of the money, especially since the value of the money he's getting is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's time for me to make another offer. Since Bob's offer was a bit too aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share of the money, but still keeping a bit more for myself. The message is a bit more conciliatory, trying to convey that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You want to find a middle ground? Let's meet right in the middle then! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to drive the point home that he's willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm not sure if he's being serious or just trying to trap me into a 50/50 split.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll accept this offer. Since the money is worth less and less with each passing round, I'd rather get a guaranteed 50/50 split than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
