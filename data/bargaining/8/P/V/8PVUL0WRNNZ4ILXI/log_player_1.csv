# Bob gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair here. Let's get closer to a 50/50 split, or we'll both be losing out. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but it's still heavily in his favor considering the inflation working against him.  He's feeling the pressure, and we can leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 620000,
""bob_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer or watch your share dwindle to nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He's offered a near 50/50 split before, so he's clearly feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. This offer is still in my favor, but the threatening tone might be enough to get him to accept before his share diminishes even further."
