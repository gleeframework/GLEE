"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more equal split, and 70/30 is still quite far from what I had in mind. I'd like to make a new proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing that I get 55 dollars and Bob gets 45 dollars. I'm trying to find a more balanced split this time."
