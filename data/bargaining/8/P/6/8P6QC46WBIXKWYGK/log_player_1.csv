"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I want a bit more for myself! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 95% of the original $4,000 (due to the 5% inflation). Bob will get $6,000, which is worth 80% of the original $7,500 (due to the 20% inflation).

I'm not sure if it's a good deal, but I'll decide to...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, where I would get $4,500 and Bob would get $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's getting greedy!

Considering the inflation, my $3,000 gain is worth only 86.74% of the original $3,500 (due to the 14.26% inflation). Bob's $7,000 gain is worth only 51.2% of the original $13,636 (due to the 48.8% inflation).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think about it...
