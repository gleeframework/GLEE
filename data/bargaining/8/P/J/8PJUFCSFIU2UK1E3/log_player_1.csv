"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and keep 60.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and generous offer to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll give you 50 and take 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer, I think 50-50 is a reasonable split, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining value. Since the money is worth 20% less than before, the actual amount I'd be getting is $40 (50 * 0.8).

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (due to two rounds of 20% inflation), I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I think 70 is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this time, but I think 25 is a good compromise considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I think 75 is a good compromise, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob such a large share. Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value now (due to three rounds of 20% inflation), I'm not sure if 75 is the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to squeeze out a better deal. Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value now, I'll aim for an even higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'll give you 20. It's the best I can do.""
