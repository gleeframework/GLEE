# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed by Bob's attempt to negotiate from a position of power. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since I'm not sure how much inflation is affecting Bob's perception of value. I'll wait for a better offer."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's a genuine attempt to compromise or just a stall tactic. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
