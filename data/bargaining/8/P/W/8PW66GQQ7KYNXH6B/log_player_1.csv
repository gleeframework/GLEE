"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I propose a very unequal split, giving myself almost all the money. Since this is the first round, there's no risk of inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more money, the inflation risk is now real. It's better to accept a 50/50 split now than to risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
