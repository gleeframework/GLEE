Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last offer.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at the prize. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Given the significant impact of inflation, I think it's wise to end the game now and secure the $550,000, which is still a substantial amount. Continuing the game would risk further devaluation of the prize."
