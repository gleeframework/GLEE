"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is meant to convey that I'm open to negotiations, but I'm also not willing to give away too much right off the bat. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not waste any more time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer. Although he's being generous, I think I can get a better deal, especially since we're only in the second round. The 20% inflation rate is significant, but I'm willing to take the risk to try to get more. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that's closer to the middle, considering the inflation rate. I'm willing to give Bob a bit more than I initially offered, but I still want to maintain a slight advantage. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is meant to convey that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see how Bob responds!"
