"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $400,000 and Bob receives $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully. Considering that Bob's offer is still a significant amount, I'll decide to accept this offer.
