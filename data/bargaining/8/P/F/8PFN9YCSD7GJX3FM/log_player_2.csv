"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While the offer is less than Alice's initial proposal, the inflation means my share is worth less. Accepting this offer is better than risking another round with further potential losses.
* **Potential Loss:** If I reject, the next round I may get even less, as Alice could further exploit the inflation effect. 

It's a gamble, but accepting seems the safest option given the current circumstances."
