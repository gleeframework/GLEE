I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  Let's see if Bob is happy with it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair. While the money I gain is the same, his share has increased significantly. I won't accept this, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit, but still offering Bob a decent amount. I'm hoping he sees that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the inflation eats away at his share even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still ridiculously unfair. His share keeps climbing while mine is decreasing.  I'm not going to let him take advantage of the inflation like this.  I'll keep negotiating for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still offering Bob a reasonable amount. I'm hoping he realizes that the longer we wait, the less money we both get.  This is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unreasonable. I'm starting to get worried about how much longer this game will go on. It seems like we're both just getting greedier and less rational.  But I'm still determined to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a slight compromise. I know this is a risky move with the inflation ticking higher, but Bob seems determined to maximize his share. I'm hoping this offer shows him that we need to reach a solution soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly stubborn. While his share has increased, he is losing a significant amount due to inflation. I'm not going to give in to his demands at this point.  The money I'm losing because of his stubbornness is far less than the loss he's incurring."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're getting dangerously close to the end of the game. I'm offering an even split. This is the most logical and fair solution. It might not be what either of us wants, but it's the best way to avoid losing everything."
