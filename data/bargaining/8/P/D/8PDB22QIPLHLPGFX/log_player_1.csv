"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll take the lion's share, but it's still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 40% and leave you with 60%, it's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 40% of the money, but it's a compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can finalize the deal."
