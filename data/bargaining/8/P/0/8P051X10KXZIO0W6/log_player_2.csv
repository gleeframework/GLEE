"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. With each passing round, the money loses value for me faster than it does for Alice. I want to make a counteroffer that benefits me more, considering the inflation rate is higher for me.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round where I can make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a larger share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hits you harder. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, accepting this offer seems the most reasonable choice. The difference in inflation rates between us has already taken a substantial toll on the value of the money for me, and proceeding further might result in even greater losses. Alice's offer, although not perfectly fair in an ideal scenario, appears more favorable under the current circumstances, especially since she considers it her final offer.\n\nLet's conclude the game here."
