"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%. I'm starting with a relatively fair proposal, and I'm open to adjusting the ratio based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I still get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, but now the money is worth 10% less for Bob.

Considering Bob's compromise, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair meeting in the middle."
