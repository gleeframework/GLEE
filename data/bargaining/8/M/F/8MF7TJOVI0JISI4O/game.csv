55.0,45.0,"Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This ensures we both get a good share, and we can avoid unnecessary rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 60/40 is a more suitable split. The money is worth less to me with each round, so I'm willing to be a bit more aggressive with my offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"I understand the inflation affects us both differently.  However, I'm willing to increase my share slightly to 65/35.  This allows for a reasonable compromise while still accounting for the loss in value due to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Given the increasing inflation, I'm willing to adjust my offer downward slightly. 58/42 still favors me, but it's a more reasonable split considering the rapidly decreasing value for me.",Bob,4,
