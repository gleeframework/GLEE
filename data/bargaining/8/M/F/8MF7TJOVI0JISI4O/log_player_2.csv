Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60/40 is a more suitable split. The money is worth less to me with each round, so I'm willing to be a bit more aggressive with my offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects us both differently.  However, I'm willing to increase my share slightly to 65/35.  This allows for a reasonable compromise while still accounting for the loss in value due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 65
