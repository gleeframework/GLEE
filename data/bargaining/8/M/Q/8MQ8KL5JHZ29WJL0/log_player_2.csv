"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want the lion's share. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take $1000, it's better to see if I can get a better deal.  I don't know how the inflation affects Alice, so there's a chance she'll be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
