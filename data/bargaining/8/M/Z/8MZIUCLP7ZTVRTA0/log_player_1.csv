I'm going to start by being generous, but I'll be keeping a close eye on that inflation!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a major factor now. This offer is a decent compromise and ensures I get something. It's better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round!"
