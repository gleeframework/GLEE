"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  Let's see if we can work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll receive:

Alice gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of money. I'd rather not accept this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slight majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I believe this offer is fair and gives us both a good outcome. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of money!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll receive:

Alice gain: 4500 * 0.723 (0.9 * 0.8 * 0.9) = 3251.35
Bob gain: 5500 * 0.855 (0.95 * 0.95 * 0.9) = 4692.75

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm not sure if this offer is the best I can get. However, it's getting close to the last rounds, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll accept this offer to get some money, even if it's not the best deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
