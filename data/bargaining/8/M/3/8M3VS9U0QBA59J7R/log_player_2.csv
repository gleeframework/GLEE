Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting impatient, Bob. This is my final offer before we both risk losing everything. Let's end this game and get something. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the ""final offer"" tactic, but the current rate of inflation means waiting is riskier for her than for me. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next round as the potential winnings decrease further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm. You were right, time is running out. This is a favorable deal for both of us.  Let's be sensible and end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

-  **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. It's crucial to emphasize the shrinking pot.
-  **Slight Concession:** Offering Alice slightly more than last time shows a willingness to negotiate, but I'm not budging significantly.
- **Firmness:** The message needs to convey that I'm serious about my position and won't be pressured into a bad deal by her tactics."
