I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and Bob might accept it. I'm also trying to account for inflation, as I know the money will be worth less in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I'm now losing 20% of the value of my potential gains due to inflation, I still feel that this offer is too lopsided. I'm willing to negotiate, but a 10/90 split is simply unacceptable. I'm hoping that Bob will see reason and offer a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, reflecting the impact of inflation. However, I believe it's still a fair offer, as Bob has also experienced inflation. I hope he'll recognize this and be willing to negotiate further."
