"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for an even split, but the inflation makes it riskier for you each round. I'm offering a bit more than last time. Let's settle this before it devalues further. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
