"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000$, which is 40% of the total. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to think carefully about the inflation effect.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my gain of 3000$ is still worth 3000$. However, Bob's gain of 7000$ is worth 20% less than his original 4000$, which is 3200$. This means that Bob is actually offering me a better deal than his initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer.

Since the money is worth 0.8 times its original value due to inflation, I'll offer Bob a smaller share to account for this. I'll also try to get a better deal for myself.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I want a bit more for myself.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, aren't you? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

Let's analyze the offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my gain of 2000$ is still worth 2000$. However, Bob's gain of 8000$ is worth 48.8% less than his original 4000$, which is approximately 2080.32$. This means that Bob is offering me a smaller share than before, but his gain is also worth less due to inflation.

Considering the inflation effect, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 5

Since the money is worth 0.5192 times its original value due to inflation (1 - 0.48), I'll offer Bob a smaller share to account for this. I'll also try to get a better deal for myself.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share for myself.""

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really lowballing me now! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit frustrated!

Let's analyze the offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my gain of 1000$ is still worth 1000$. However, Bob's gain of 9000$ is worth 67.23% less than his original 4000$, which is approximately 1316.8$. This means that Bob is offering me a very small share, but his gain is actually worth more than before due to inflation.
