Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going to 50/50 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being incredibly stubborn and unwilling to budge much. We're past the halfway point of the rounds, and the value for me is decreasing significantly. While 43 is a little better than previous offers, it's still a bad deal considering the shrinking pot. I need to put more pressure on her to accept a fairer deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. My share is losing value fast. This is my final offer before I have to start being unreasonable to make up for the losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, you're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is getting dangerous.  Alice is clearly trying to push me to the very end, knowing the inflation hurts me more than it hurts her. While this offer isn't good, it's better than her previous offer, and taking any further risk of ending up with nothing is too great.  It's time to cut my losses and accept."
