Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's analyze why rejecting is a good strategy here:

* **Inflation is on our side:**  While Bob's offer seems ""fairer"" on the surface, the value of the money decreases faster for us than for him. It's in our interest to push for a better deal sooner rather than later.
* **Bob is likely to get more desperate:** Bob's offer suggests he might be feeling the pressure of the decreasing value. If he's already willing to split relatively evenly, he might concede even more in the next round. 

**Reasoning:**

It's a gamble, but rejecting now signals to Bob that we're serious about getting a better deal. The risk of the money devaluing further for both of us might push him towards a more favorable offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still the most reasonable. This takes inflation into account, let's close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** Bob is likely feeling the heat of the decreasing value, and this offer is designed to be enticing enough for him to accept.
* **Slight Concession:** We've lowered our demand by $500 from the initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a favorable outcome. 
* **Urgency:** The message stresses the need to close the deal quickly due to inflation, reinforcing the idea that waiting is detrimental to both parties."
