"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

Since Bob's offer is now $5,000 for me and $5,000 for Bob, I'll reject the offer because it's not significantly different from the initial offer I made. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a slightly larger share to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less for me now, so I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, considering the inflation. I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less for me now, so I'll aim to get a larger share to make up for it. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I need to make up for the inflation, so I'm taking a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```

I'm going back to my initial offer from Round 1, but with a stronger message to emphasize my need for a larger share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. This is my last chance to make a decent offer. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less for me now, and I'm running out of time. Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure if it's enough. Considering the inflation, I think I can do better.

However, since this is Bob's ""last chance"" offer, I'll accept it to avoid going to the next round and risking an even worse deal.
