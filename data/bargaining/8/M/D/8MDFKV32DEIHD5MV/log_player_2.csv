Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still the one who's taking the majority.  This is a good deal for you considering your money is losing value faster than mine. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even though the value is decreasing, accepting such a low offer sets a bad precedent and gives Alice too much negotiating power.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 423750,
""alice_gain"": 576250,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer is my bottom line. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round, my potential gains decrease. I need to apply more pressure to reach a deal.
* **Firm Stance:**  By presenting this as my ""bottom line,"" I'm hoping Alice will take the offer seriously and realize I'm willing to walk away.
* **Calculated Risk:**  Offering slightly less than the 50/50 split shows flexibility but also emphasizes that I understand the value of time in this negotiation."
