"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 10% less for Alice, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still being worth 100% and Alice's gain being worth 81% (100% - 19% due to inflation), I'll try to take advantage of the difference. However, 45 is a relatively low amount for me, considering I could get 50 in the first round. I'll try to get closer to that. 

I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is still worth 100%, but Alice's gain is now worth 81% (due to 19% inflation), I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42}"
