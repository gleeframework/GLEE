"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start, let's see where this leads. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'd rather take a slightly higher share now.
