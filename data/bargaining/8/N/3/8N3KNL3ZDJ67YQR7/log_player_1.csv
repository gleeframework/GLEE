"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'm willing to consider Bob's proposal.

After reviewing the offer, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept $5,000 and Bob can take $5,000 as well."
