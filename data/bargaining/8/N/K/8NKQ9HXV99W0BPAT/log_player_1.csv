"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for my negotiation skills 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the amounts are:

* Alice gain: 2,375
* Bob gain: 7,125

I'm not impressed with the offer, considering the initial offer I made was 60-40. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor than my initial offer, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the amounts are:

* Alice gain: 2,050
* Bob gain: 3,675

I'm not happy with this offer. The inflation has taken a bigger bite out of the money, and I think I deserve a larger share to compensate. I'll reject the offer and make a new one.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. We're both adults, let's split it 50-50 and be done with it.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the previous offers. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
