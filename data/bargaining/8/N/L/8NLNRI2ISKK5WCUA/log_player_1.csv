"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous split. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's avoid going through too many rounds, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is indeed more balanced, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 55% of the remaining $10,000.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Consider this a reasonable offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  A 50/50 split is the fairest solution, and we can both walk away with a significant amount.  This is the last round before the inflation hurts us both more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is indeed a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds with the money losing value. I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
