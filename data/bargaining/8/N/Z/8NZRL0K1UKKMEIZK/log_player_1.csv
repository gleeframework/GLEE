"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair offer and accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, but I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to show I'm open to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""
}


I've reduced my initial offer to try to find a middle ground with Bob. Since the money is worth 10% less with each passing round, I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer rather than risking further devaluation."
