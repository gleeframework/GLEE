"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a great deal!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it quickly, before the money loses value due to inflation. My message to Bob is friendly and emphasizes the fairness of the deal, in an attempt to persuade him to accept. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a 60-40 split, but in my favor this time.  Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as it's the same split I offered him in the first round, but in his favor this time. I think I can get a better deal than that. Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, I'll need to take that into account when making my next offer. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 is a fair compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a compromise between my initial offer of 60-40 and Bob's offer of 40-60. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept it. My message to Bob emphasizes the idea of compromise and fairness. Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable solution before the value of the money decreases further. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
