"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal, so I'm proposing a split that's a little more equitable while still acknowledging the time value of money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value for me with each round. Accepting 4000 in round 2 means it's effectively worth even less than that.
* **Stronger Position:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, I signal I'm not desperate and believe a better deal is possible. I now have the power to propose.
* **Strategic Offer:** My offer is still generous to Alice (she gets more than in a 50/50 split) but takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. My message aims to be persuasive and frame the offer as a win-win."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is quite generous. Think twice before rejecting! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** While Alice is correct that her offer factors in the inflation to some degree, it's still not beneficial for me. Accepting 4200 now is significantly less valuable than 4000 in the first round. 
* **Alice is Feeling the Pressure:** Her message suggests she might be worried about the game continuing. This implies I might be able to secure a better deal in the next round.
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a risk Alice's next offer could be even worse, but I'm willing to gamble on getting a more equitable split, knowing time is working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's end this on a fair and simple note: 50/50.  It's clear we both want to reach an agreement, and this ensures we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. Every round that passes significantly impacts my potential gain. 
* **Finality:** This is likely my last chance to secure a reasonably fair deal. If Alice rejects this, her next offer will likely be unacceptable given the advanced stage of inflation.
* **Clean Split:** A 50/50 split is the most straightforward and easily justifiable solution. It removes the complexity of negotiating against the inflation factor and presents a clean resolution.

By offering a 50/50 split at this stage, I'm conveying a sense of urgency while also appealing to Alice's desire for a fair outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should consider accepting, the inflation is really hurting your gains! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The inflation has reached a critical point. Accepting 3800 now is still better than risking an even lower offer from Alice in the next round, where the value would further plummet.
* **Downward Trend:**  Alice's offers have been consistently favoring her more and more. This offer, while not ideal, is better than what she might propose in a future round.
* **Minimizing Losses:** At this stage, it's more about damage control than securing a great deal. Accepting now cuts my losses and prevents the situation from deteriorating further. 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most logical choice given the severe impact of the inflation and the diminishing returns with each passing round."
