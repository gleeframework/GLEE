"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, Bob should reject it. He has 12 rounds to negotiate, and the value of the money will decrease for Alice much faster than for him.  This gives Bob leverage to potentially secure a larger share later in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a fair split. Let's end this quickly and avoid further devaluation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair split, Bob, but time is also costing us. This offer is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, Bob still has the upper hand. He knows that the money is losing value faster for Alice, and he can likely secure a more favorable deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my previous offer. The longer we wait, the less money we both get.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money with each round. Let's meet in the middle. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the decreasing value of the money, Bob should still reject her offer. He has the leverage in this negotiation, and can likely secure a more favorable deal in the remaining rounds. The risk of waiting is less for Bob than for Alice, given the different inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, I've been patient, but time is running out. This is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's the best way to avoid losing more money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We need to settle this now. This offer is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm willing to do it to avoid us both losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 540000 
# Alice gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob should accept this offer.  While it's not as ideal as his previous offer, Alice's offer is a fair compromise given the decreasing value of the money and the fact that they only have a few rounds left.  The risk of waiting is no longer worth the potential for a slightly larger gain, as the value of money will continue to drop rapidly for both players.  This offer provides a significant amount of money for both of them, and it's the best way to ensure that they both get something before time runs out."
