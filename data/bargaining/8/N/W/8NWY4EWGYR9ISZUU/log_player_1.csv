Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I deserve a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with a message that tries to justify my slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. It's a little less for me, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI don't think this is a fair split, considering the inflation and the fact that I was offering a more generous split in the first round. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous. Let's settle this!""}\n\nIn this round, I've taken into account the inflation from the previous rounds. The money is now worth 10% less than in the first round. Given this, I'm offering $5700 for myself and $4300 for Bob. I believe this is a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too. The message I've included emphasizes my consideration of the inflation factor and my desire to reach a mutually agreeable settlement. Let's see how Bob responds!"
