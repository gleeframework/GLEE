"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor. I figure Bob might accept it since it's only $1 for him, and I'm not sure how much the inflation will impact him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'm unhappy with this outcome, I'd rather take $1 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
