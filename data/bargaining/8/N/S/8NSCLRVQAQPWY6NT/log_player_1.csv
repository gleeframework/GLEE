Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount.  I'm hoping it's enough to be accepted in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation rate makes this a good deal for me.  I'll get $5000, which is still a significant amount, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the future due to the inflation."
