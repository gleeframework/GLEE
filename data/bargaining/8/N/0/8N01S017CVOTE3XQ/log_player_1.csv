"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 6000 and Bob gets 4000. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fairer, as the value of the money is decreasing faster for you than me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I understand Bob's reasoning, and I agree that the value of the money is decreasing faster for me due to the 10% inflation. However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60-40 split being the same as before.

I'll make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll consider 55-45, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation difference.""}

I'm willing to accept a slightly more skewed split, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable compromise given the new circumstances."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52-48 is a fairer split considering the inflation difference.""}

I've adjusted the split to 52-48, which is a slightly more favorable split for me given the increased inflation. I hope Bob will consider this offer and accept it."
