I'm Bob, and I'm going to see if I can get a better deal than 1000 dollars. Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. I'm sure we can both agree that's the fairest way to do this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more this time, but I'm still keeping an eye on the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it!  While I'd love more, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round.  Let's end this now."
