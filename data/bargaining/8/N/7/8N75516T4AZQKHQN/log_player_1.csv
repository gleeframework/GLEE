Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

``` 

This is a tough decision! However, accepting Bob's offer would mean I lose almost 60% of the initial value due to inflation. I'm banking on him becoming more reasonable in the next round as the value decreases further."
