"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the offer is close to the original 50/50 split, and it's not a bad deal considering the inflation, I'll accept it this time.
