7000.0,3000.0,Let's split the money 7000 for me and 3000 for you. We can adjust if it doesn't work out in future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to give you a higher share this round, but I think 4:1 is too generous. I'm hoping for a more balanced split.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,I think a 6000/4000 split is fair considering the previous offers. Let's see if we can agree on this.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway on the 6:4 split, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the reduced value of money due to inflation. This is my best offer so far.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
