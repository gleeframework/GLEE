"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable, given my superior negotiating skills. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's better than what we'll both get if this drags on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair split. However, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is the most reasonable outcome considering the decreasing value of the money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage and mirror my previous offer with himself coming out on top.  While the money is decreasing, I'm willing to gamble he'll be more reasonable as the stakes get higher."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out. 52.5/47.5 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round.  I'm willing to accept a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor, but we need to come to an agreement before the value of our potential gains drops even further. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is being incredibly stubborn, but he's finally willing to agree to a split we've discussed.  While I'd prefer my 52.5/47.5 split, accepting his mirrored offer now is better than risking even further losses to inflation as we approach the deadline."
