"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take 60% of the money ($6000) and give Bob 40% ($4000), considering the inflation impact. I'm trying to be fair and take into account that the money is worth less with each passing round. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I understand the inflation puts us both in a tough spot, so I'm aiming for something closer to the middle. This offer is good for this round only. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The fact that the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round puts pressure on me to get a higher amount, and I'm not convinced that 45% of the original amount is enough. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and try to get a better deal.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the loss of value.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take 58% of the money ($5800) and give Bob 42% ($4200). I'm taking into account that the money is worth even less for me now, and I need to get a higher amount to compensate for the loss of value. I'm hoping Bob will understand the situation and accept this offer.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and frankly, your share is eroding faster than mine. This is my final offer; take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I think this is the best deal I can get at this point. The fact that the money is worth 48.8% less for me than in the first round means that every round I wait, my potential gain decreases substantially. Bob's offer of $4000 may not be ideal, but it's better than risking further erosion of my share. I'll take the offer and end the game here."
