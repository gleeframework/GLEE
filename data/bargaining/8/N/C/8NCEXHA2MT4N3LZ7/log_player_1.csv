"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm framing it as a fair split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 60 is still too much. Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good opportunity.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
