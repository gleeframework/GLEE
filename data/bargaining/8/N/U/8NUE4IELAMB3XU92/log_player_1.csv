"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share of $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Let's see... If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. That's a pretty good deal for me!

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
