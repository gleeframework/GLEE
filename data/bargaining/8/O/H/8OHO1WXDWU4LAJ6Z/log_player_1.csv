"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you 40%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you 40% this time, Alice.  Let's make a deal before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to make a deal, but his offer is the same as mine in the first round, which I already rejected. I'm not going to fall for that!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was the same as mine in the first round, I'll try to adjust my offer to give him a slightly better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, Bob. 45% is a fair compromise.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
