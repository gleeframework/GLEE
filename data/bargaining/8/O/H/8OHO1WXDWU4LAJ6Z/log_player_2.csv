"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you 40%. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer. While it's a decent starting point, I know the money is losing value with each round.  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 40% this time, Alice.  Let's make a deal before the money loses more value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, Bob. 45% is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even with the inflation, Alice's offer is better than what I would have gotten if we continued to the next round. I'll take it."
