I'll take 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%.  I figure this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this time.  I'll take 45% and leave him with 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

While I'd prefer a larger share, with each round the money is worth less and less. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing at all in a future round."
