"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive opening offer.  I'm taking almost everything for myself!  However, since Bob doesn't know about the inflation yet, I'm giving him a small amount just to see how he reacts. I'm curious to see if he'll try to negotiate or if he'll simply accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, this is a fair offer considering the inflation. Accepting this means we both get a significant amount of money, and it avoids the risk of further rounds where I might get a worse deal."
