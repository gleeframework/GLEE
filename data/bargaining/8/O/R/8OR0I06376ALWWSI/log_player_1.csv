Let's see if Bob agrees to a small share in the beginning.  I'll keep the lion's share for myself, but I'll give Bob something to think about."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take half now than to risk getting nothing in the later rounds.  While I lose money due to inflation, at least I get something."
