Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we're both losing money. I'm willing to compromise, but let's make it work this round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  Take it or leave it -  we both lose if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to hold firm and hope she makes a more reasonable offer in the next round.  Time is running out, but accepting a bad deal is worse than getting nothing at all."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm. This is a fair offer considering the dwindling time and the impact of inflation. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something substantial.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a deal you can't refuse, again.  The clock is ticking, let's make this work. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has shifted considerably. While Alice's offer is still far from ideal, the impact of inflation is becoming increasingly detrimental. Accepting $400,000 now, even with a 26.49% loss, is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds where the inflation penalty will be even higher."
