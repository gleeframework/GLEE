"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting with a fair offer. Let's divide the money equally and be done with it.""
}
```

This way, we both get $400,000 each, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a calculated risk here, knowing the money will be worth less in the next round.  I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to take that into account. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is still worth the same as in the first round. But if I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, I'll have to make a new offer, and the money will be worth 10% less than in the first round.

Considering the inflation factor, I think it's a good idea to take the safe bet and accept this offer. I'll get the same amount of money as in the first round, and I won't have to worry about the decreasing value of the money in the next round.
