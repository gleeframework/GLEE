"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share this round.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We can avoid the inflation and make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth 95 (100 - 5% of 100).

I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
