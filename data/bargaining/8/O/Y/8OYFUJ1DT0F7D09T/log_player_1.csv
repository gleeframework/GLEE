I'm offering to take $600,000 and giving Bob $400,000, with a message trying to persuade him that it's a fair deal.

Please relay this to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the next round will reduce the value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I've taken into account the 5% decrease in value from the previous rounds and made an offer that tries to find a middle ground. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
