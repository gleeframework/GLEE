Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, it's in my best interest to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Inflation will decrease the value of the money, so I have incentive to try to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
