"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining 60%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. Let's aim for a 6/4 split in our favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 48% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 48% of the original amount as well.

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 38.4% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3840,
  ""bob_gain"": 6160,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need something in return!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
