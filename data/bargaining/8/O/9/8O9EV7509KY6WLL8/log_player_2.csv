**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for both of us, but especially for Alice.  This means every round makes the potential gains less appealing.
* **Alice's Desperation:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is lowering her demand. She started at 55, then went to 60, and now 58. Her need is likely to make her more agreeable in future rounds if this offer is rejected.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in the hope of getting a slightly better deal in a later round is very risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer more, and the value of the money will continue to decrease.

It's a tough choice, but accepting a smaller loss now is preferable to risking a much larger loss later."
