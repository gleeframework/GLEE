"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let us divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. This is a generous offer considering the inflation rate for Bob is higher than mine. I am hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth 5% less for me, it is worth 10% less for Bob, which puts more pressure on him to make a deal. I am hoping to capitalize on this and get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 42% of the money and keeping 58% for myself. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but still takes into account the higher inflation rate for Bob. I am trying to appear reasonable and willing to compromise, while still getting a good deal for myself."
