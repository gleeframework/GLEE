"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so if I were to accept Bob's offer, I would actually get $38 (40% of $100) and Bob would get $62.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since I was hoping for a slightly larger share. I'll reject it and make my next offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is a fair split.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing that I get 55% of the $100, and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the 14.26% decrease in value, if I were to accept Bob's offer, I would actually get $24.16 (28% of the original $100, but adjusted for inflation).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll accept it, hoping that I can get a better deal in future rounds.
