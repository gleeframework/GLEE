Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair deal, Bob, but time is money. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The impact of inflation isn't significant enough yet to warrant accepting a less-than-fair deal. I'm betting Alice will become more amenable to a fairer split as the rounds progress and the value of the money decreases."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice, but so is fairness. This offer is a compromise, let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but your demands are getting unreasonable. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The impact of inflation is becoming significant. While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting Alice's offer now secures me a reasonable sum. If I reject this offer and don't manage to secure a significantly better deal in the next few rounds, the effects of inflation will start to outweigh any potential gains."
