"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent chunk to make the game worth his while."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a fair offer, and it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money. I'll accept this offer.
