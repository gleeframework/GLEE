"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to adjust my calculation considering the inflation.

In the first round, I offered $6,000, which was 60% of the total. Now, considering the 5% decrease in value, I would have gotten $5,400 (60% of $9,000, which is 90% of the original $10,000 due to inflation).

Bob's new offer is $5,000, which is 50% of the remaining $10,000. Considering the 20% decrease in value for Bob, he would be getting 40% of the original $10,000, which is $4,000.

So, in this round, I would be getting $5,000 and Bob would be getting $5,000.

My message to Bob:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept the offer!"
