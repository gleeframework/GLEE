"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."

# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't refuse! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob is trying to be too generous with his offer.

I'll reject his offer and try to make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! I'm not giving up that much.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""You took a big lead last round, now it's my turn to try and catch up!""
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to catch up, but I'm not letting you get close! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze as much as he can out of me.

I'll think carefully before making a decision. With the inflation effect, my gain is worth even less now, so I need to be strategic. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not giving up yet, Bob! I'll try to make a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation effect is really taking its toll on my gains! With my money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be even more careful with my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 15,
  ""bob_gain"": 85,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob, but I'm still trying to hold on to what's left!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're almost out of options, Alice. It's time to surrender! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to rub it in! With my money worth a mere fraction of its original value, I'm running out of options. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

However, I'm not ready to give up yet! I'll reject this offer and try to make one last-ditch attempt to salvage what's left.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not done yet, Bob! I'll make one final offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation effect is really crushing me now! With my money worth a mere 32.77% of its original value, I'm essentially playing for scraps. I'll make one final, desperate offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5,
  ""bob_gain"": 95,
  ""message"": ""This is my last stand, Bob. I'll take whatever I can get.""
}
```

I'm basically surrendering, but I'm trying to salvage what's left."
