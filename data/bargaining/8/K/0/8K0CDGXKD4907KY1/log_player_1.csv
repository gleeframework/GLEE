"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a relatively fair share, considering I'm the one making the first offer. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal, emphasizing the importance of being fair. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better with a little bit more fairness for me this round. Let's find a good solution! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not ready to accept an offer that gives Bob a larger share, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round to try to get a better deal for myself. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nGiven that the money is now worth 5% less than the original amount, I'm adjusting my offer to 52 dollars for myself and 48 dollars for Bob. This still gives me a slightly larger share, but I'm trying to be more reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money. My message to Bob emphasizes meeting in the middle, hoping to appeal to his sense of fairness and encourage him to accept this offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
