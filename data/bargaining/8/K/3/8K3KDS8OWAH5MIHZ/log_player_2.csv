"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly. This offer gives me a good share while ensuring you get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice is emphasizing that it's her final offer, I believe she's still trying to get the better end of the deal. Given that the money is worth 19% less to her than in the first round, and considering she's still offering me a relatively low amount, I think there's room for further negotiation. I'll proceed to the next round and try to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Given the significant decrease in value for you, I believe this split is more than fair.""}"
