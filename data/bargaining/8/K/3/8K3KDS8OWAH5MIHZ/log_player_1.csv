Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant decrease in value for you, I believe this split is more than fair. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Accepting $450,000 now is better than risking getting an even lower amount in future rounds.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob knows I'm experiencing inflation and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better in subsequent rounds. He's likely to propose offers that increasingly favor him.

Waiting any longer exposes me to greater losses due to the inflation mechanic."
