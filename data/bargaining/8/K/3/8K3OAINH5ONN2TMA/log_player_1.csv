I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure it's a fair starting point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if you reject this offer.  Let's see what you think!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to compromise, I still believe I deserve a slightly larger share after you rejected my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time."
