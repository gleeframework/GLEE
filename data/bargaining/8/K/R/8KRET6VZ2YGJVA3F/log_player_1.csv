"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward and simple proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400000, but I want 600000""
}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up more than I have to."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 5% less again due to inflation. Here's my new proposal:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""You can have a small share, but I'm the one who's really driving this negotiation!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bigger share, but still keeping the offer somewhat reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! 

However, Bob's offer is still quite lopsided in his favor. I'm not willing to accept such a small share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I want a bigger share, don't try to lowball me!""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal."

  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile""

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offers are getting progressively worse, and I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. However, I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I need a bigger share, don't try to squeeze me out!""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal, but I'm starting to run out of time and options."

  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'm making one last serious offer, don't expect me to go lower""

```

I'm trying to get as much as I can, but I'm also aware that I need to be realistic about the time left and the inflation. This is my best offer so far."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offers are getting increasingly absurd, and I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. Accepting this offer would mean I'd be giving up nearly 80% of my potential earnings. I'm not willing to do that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not serious, are you? That's an insult!""
}
```

I'll try to make one last, desperate attempt to get a better deal."

  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""This is my last offer, take it or leave it. I'm not going lower""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to give you a tiny share to get this done. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an insult. I'm not going to accept a share that's less than 5% of the total. I'd be better off not getting anything at all.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not even trying to be serious, are you? I'm out of here""
}
```

I've had enough of Bob's ridiculous offers. I'm done playing this game."

  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm making one last, final offer. Take it or leave it, I don't care""
}
```

I'm not even bothering to negotiate at this point. I just want to get something, anything, out of this game."
