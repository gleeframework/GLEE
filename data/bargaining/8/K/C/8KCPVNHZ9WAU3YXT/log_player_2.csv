"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand your initial offer, but it's not in my best interest. Let's meet in the middle.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money decreases rapidly for Alice (20% per round). This puts pressure on her to accept a deal sooner rather than later. 
* **Fairness:** While a 50/50 split might seem initially fair, Bob's money is losing value slower. A slight advantage for Bob in the split accounts for this disparity.
* **Negotiation:** Offering a little more than Alice's previous offer to Bob might make her more amenable to a deal."
