"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to balance the value of our gains, considering the inflation effect on Bob's share."
