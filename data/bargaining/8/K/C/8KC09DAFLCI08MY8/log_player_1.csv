Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation rates we're facing. It allows us both to get a decent amount, while still accounting for the devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
