"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 60 and you get 40. It's a better deal than the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the fact that I'll be getting 40% of the remaining money, which is worth 5% less than the original 60% I proposed. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I rejected your previous offer""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining money, which is a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer. I'm trying to make a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
