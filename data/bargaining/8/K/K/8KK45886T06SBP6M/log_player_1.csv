"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the initial $10,000, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll receive $4,500 instead of $4,800. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than a 50/50 split. Let's negotiate further.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a more even split, but with a slight bias towards my gain. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
