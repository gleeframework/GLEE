"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $95 for me. I'll make a proposal that gives me a decent share, but not too greedy.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $90.90 for me. Alice's offer is a bit more generous than before, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth 9.75% less for me now, so $100 is equivalent to $90.90 for me. I'll make a proposal that's a bit more aggressive this time.
