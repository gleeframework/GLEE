6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  This way we both benefit from dividing the money early.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share this time. We can then alternate in the future.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take a little less, you get a little more. $5,800 for me, $4,200 for you.  Time is running out, and remember, the pot is shrinking for you!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share this time, Alice, but I need to start getting more. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's make a deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm being flexible, but you're losing money due to inflation!  $5,700 for me, $4,300 for you.  Take it before it shrinks even more!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to give you less this time, but I need to secure a larger share for myself. Let's split it 65/35, and hopefully we can find a solution that works for both of us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, you're running out of time!  I'm lowering my take again to $5,500, leaving you with $4,500.  Let's be smart and take the deal before inflation eats away at your share even more!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, we are both losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to take a bigger risk and offer you a smaller share, but we need to come to an agreement. I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me taking the larger share. This is my final offer before the money becomes practically worthless. Let's make a deal.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous! I'm dropping my offer again to $5,300, leaving you with $4,700.  Don't be foolish, every round your potential gain shrinks!  Let's end this now before it's too late!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, this is getting desperate. We're both losing money, and if we don't agree soon, we'll get nothing.  I'm willing to take the largest share, but I need to secure enough to make this worth it.  Let's split it 75/25, with me getting the larger share.  It's now or never.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, this is the FINAL OFFER.  I'm taking a significant hit to end this madness. $5,100 for me, $4,900 for you.  Take it or leave it, because one more round and we BOTH get NOTHING!",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,accept
