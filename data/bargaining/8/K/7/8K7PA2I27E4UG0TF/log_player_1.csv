"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly!""}\n\n###\nI made the first offer, giving myself $600,000 and Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting a fair division. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you a great deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer still gives me a considerable amount, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, considering the initial amount was $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, taking into account the 5% decrease in value for my gain due to inflation. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation and the previous offers, I've decided to make a counteroffer that meets Bob's previous offer halfway, adjusting for the decreased value due to inflation. I've offered $525,000 for myself and $475,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting we meet in the middle. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation rate and the decreasing value of my gain, I've decided to accept Bob's offer in Round 4. Although I initially aimed for a higher amount, the offer of $475,000 is reasonable, and the 14.26% decrease in value due to inflation has reduced my potential gain significantly. Given the circumstances, accepting this offer seems like the best decision to ensure a substantial gain. The game is over, and we've reached an agreement!"
