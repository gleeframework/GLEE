I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only 10% of the money! I'll take my chances and see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering Alice 10% and keeping 90% for myself.  This is a fair starting point, given the risks of inflation.  Let's see what she decides!"
