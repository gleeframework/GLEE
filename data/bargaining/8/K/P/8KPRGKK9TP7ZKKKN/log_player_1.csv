"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both receive $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was a 60/40 split, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
