"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original 100$, which is 20$. This leaves me with 80$. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
