Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're trying to take advantage of the inflation. My turn now. Let's do $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you.  This is a better deal for me than your previous offer, and we both lose less to inflation by settling now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
