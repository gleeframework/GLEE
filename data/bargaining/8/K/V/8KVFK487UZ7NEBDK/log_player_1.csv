"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
```

This offer splits the money fairly evenly, giving a slight advantage to Alice. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly worse for me than my original offer, even after inflation. I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest way to divide the money, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept it after his previous offer was rejected."
