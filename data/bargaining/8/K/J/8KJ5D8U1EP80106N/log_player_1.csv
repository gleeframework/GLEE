"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer is a fair starting point. I want to secure the majority of the money in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation significantly impacting my share in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential winnings.  Securing 50% of the remaining value is better than risking a worse outcome in future rounds."
