"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave 30 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation rate will benefit me more than you in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rate, I'd rather get a larger share now to account for the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
