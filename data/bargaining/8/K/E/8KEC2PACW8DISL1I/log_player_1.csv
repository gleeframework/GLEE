I'm taking a large share of the money in the first round, since inflation is working against me. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm getting less than I proposed in the first round, Bob is getting a much bigger share and I'm still being affected by inflation. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time. I'm willing to sacrifice some money to keep the game going, hoping that inflation will weaken his position further."
