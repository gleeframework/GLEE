"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:**  While my offer in round 2 was rejected, the inflation factor is now working against Alice. Her gains are worth less, making my position stronger.
* **Alice's offer:**  Alice's offer is better than her previous one, but with the inflation, my potential gains are significantly lower.  
* **Decision:**  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees me a gain, even if it's significantly less than what I initially aimed for.  Rejecting it risks a worse outcome with inflation continuing to erode my potential earnings."
