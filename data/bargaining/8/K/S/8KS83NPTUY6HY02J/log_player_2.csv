Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm going to try to flip the script and see if Alice will take my offer.  I'm hoping the inflation will work in my favor!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to wait and see what Alice offers in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly more aggressive approach, but I'm still trying to account for the inflation. I think I can get a bit more than the previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation is hitting me hard, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the game. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the next round, so I'm going to take this one."
