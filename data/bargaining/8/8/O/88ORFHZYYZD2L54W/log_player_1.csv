"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping it will set a good tone for the rest of the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about that 90-10 split.  Let's start with a more even distribution.  How about 55-45? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up that much yet. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think the 55-45 split is still too uneven, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a more even split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle at 60-40. A fair compromise?""
}
```"
