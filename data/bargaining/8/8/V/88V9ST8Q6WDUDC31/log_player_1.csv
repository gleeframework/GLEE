"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 40 * 0.95 = 38
Bob gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57

I'll accept this offer.
