Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases for you with each round. I'm offering a 55/45 split which is more than fair considering the circumstances. Take the deal before it gets worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
