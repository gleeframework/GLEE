"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can avoid a long negotiation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. My message is a friendly nudge to consider accepting the offer and ending the game quickly."
