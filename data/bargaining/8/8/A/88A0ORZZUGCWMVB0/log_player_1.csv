"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 60-40 in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better split than that. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $4500 is now worth $3600 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled about the reduced amount, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $4200 and Bob getting $5800. My message is a hint that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still looking for a better deal than Bob's previous offer."
