"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept this proposal and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering we both have a chance to propose. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the value of the money is reduced, and the new total is $9,000.

I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal, and I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sold on 55-45. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced total of $9,000 due to inflation, and considering Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, 55-45. Will you accept?""
}
```

This time, I'm mirroring Bob's previous offer, proposing a 55-45 split, but with a slight adjustment to the numbers to account for the reduced total."
