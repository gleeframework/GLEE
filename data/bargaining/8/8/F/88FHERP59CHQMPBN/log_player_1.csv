"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... With the inflation, the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is 60% of the original 3000, which is 1800. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for that.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game!"

Considering the offer, the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is 2,191.10 (4500 * 0.488). It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for that.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

Considering the offer, the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is 1,975.75 (2500 * 0.7903). It's a very small amount, but I'm not sure if I have any other options left.
