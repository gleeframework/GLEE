"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, given the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Calculate the adjusted values after inflation for both Alice and Bob from Round 2 to Round 3.
For Alice, the money is worth 20% less in each round. So, from Round 2 to Round 3, the value of the money decreases by another 20% of its value at the end of Round 2. For Bob, the money is worth 10% less in each round.

### Step 2: Formulate an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both players but still aims to reach a compromise.
Considering the inflation rates, Alice's part of the money is devaluing faster than Bob's. Thus, Alice should aim to end the game sooner rather than later to minimize loss due to inflation.

### Step 3: Since Bob rejected the initial offer and Alice rejected Bob's counteroffer, Alice needs to find a middle ground that is more favorable to Bob than the previous offer but still considers the impact of inflation on her gains.
Given that Bob proposed a 45% to 55% split in his favor in Round 2, Alice could propose a split that slightly adjusts from her original offer towards Bob's proposal but doesn't meet him halfway due to the increasing devaluation of her potential gains.

### Step 4: Calculate the proposed amounts for Alice and Bob in Round 3.
Alice initially proposed a 55% to 45% split in her favor. Considering the need to compromise but also the impact of inflation, she might adjust her offer slightly towards a 52% to 48% split, acknowledging the urgency to conclude the deal due to the devaluation of her potential gains.

### Step 5: Draft the message to accompany the offer.
The message should emphasize the urgency of reaching an agreement due to the inflation rates affecting both parties, highlighting that the proposed split is a compromise considering the impacts on both sides.

The final answer is:
```
{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's compromise to minimize losses.""}
```"
