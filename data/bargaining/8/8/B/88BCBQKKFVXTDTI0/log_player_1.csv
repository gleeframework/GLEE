"Round 1

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer, considering the potential for inflation in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm increasing Bob's portion to 20% to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate. We're both losing money with each round, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is extremely unfair.  Bob is becoming more greedy, and I refuse to be taken advantage of.  I'm willing to compromise, but not to this extent."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to compromise further and offer Bob 30% of the money.  This is a fair offer, considering the amount of money we're both losing due to inflation.  Let's work together to come to a solution before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is absurd.  I'm not going to accept a mere 1% of the money when I was initially offering him 20% in round 3.  This is clearly just a power play and an attempt to exploit my desperation. I'll continue to negotiate, but I won't be pressured into accepting something so unfair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. While this is a significant drop from my initial offer, I recognize the power of inflation and Bob's unwillingness to compromise. We're both losing money rapidly, so I'm hoping this offer is reasonable enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly unreasonable.  This offer is insulting, and I will not accept it.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not under these conditions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're both losing money rapidly. The inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  I propose a 50/50 split. It's the fairest solution at this point. Let's avoid further losses and end this negotiation."
