Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40.  We both get a decent amount, and it's fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the inflation working against her.  I need to push for a more significant advantage in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. With each round, we both lose more. It's time to split this 50/50 and avoid further losses.  We can both walk away with a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly better deal in the next round, Alice is correct that with each round we both lose more. A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances and guarantees a substantial sum for both of us. Accepting now mitigates further losses from inflation."
