Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

```
I'm offering to take 60% of the $100 and leave 40% for Bob."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I accept the offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take 40% of the $100, which is now worth 95% of its original value due to inflation."
