"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm taking the majority of the money, but I'm offering Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair and I don't want to risk losing everything to inflation."
