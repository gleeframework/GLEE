"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100, and Bob gets the remaining 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer was rejected, and now Bob is making a counteroffer.

I'll consider his proposal. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer."
