"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let us share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself, with the message ""Let us share fairly"". Let me know if Bob accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this accounts for the discount. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 5% less now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI am offering Bob 45% of the money and keeping 55% for myself, with the message ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle"". Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each of the first two rounds), I'm trying to find a compromise that takes the discount into account. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accept Bob's offer. Considering the money is worth 14.26% less now, and Bob claims this is his final offer, I think it's reasonable to accept 48.75% of the original amount. Continuing the game might lead to further losses due to inflation, so I'll settle for this deal."
