"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his gain of 6000 is actually worth 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 in the first round's money. That's a pretty good deal for him!

However, I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round.
