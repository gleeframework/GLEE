"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a generous 47.5%  to avoid drawn-out negotiations. A fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. The 5% inflation penalty for me is a consideration, but I'm willing to take the risk. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's split it down the middle. We both get an equal share, and we can walk away with no hard feelings. A fair and simple solution!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and we're both losing out.  My last offer was more than fair. I'm adjusting slightly, but this is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take the offer. The inflation penalty is starting to add up, and I don't want to risk losing more value. This offer is close enough to 50% that I'm willing to accept it and end the game.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
