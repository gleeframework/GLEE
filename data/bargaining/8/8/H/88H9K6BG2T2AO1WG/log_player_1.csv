Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as the inflation might not be as significant in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, the inflation factor makes this a good deal.  Getting half of the money is better than risking further negotiation and potentially getting a smaller share due to inflation."
