"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the new values, Bob's offer would be:

Alice gain: 400000 (worth 80% of the original $500,000)
Bob gain: 600000 (worth 90% of the original $666,667)

I'm not thrilled about giving up 20% of the original amount, but I'm also not eager to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value. Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
