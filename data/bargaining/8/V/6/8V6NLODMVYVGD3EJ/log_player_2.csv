"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to get the best deal possible. While a 4000$ gain is good, I'm confident I can get more by rejecting and seeing what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's try this?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer ensures I receive something. The inflation is significant, and continuing to reject offers could lead to a situation where I gain nothing."
