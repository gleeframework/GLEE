Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, inflation is bad for me. But I'll take that risk, meet me at 57-43 and we're done 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

Taking a hard stance for too long will only hurt Bob more in the long run. Alice seems to be catching on to the inflation disadvantage, but her offer is still better than what Bob can likely secure in later rounds."
