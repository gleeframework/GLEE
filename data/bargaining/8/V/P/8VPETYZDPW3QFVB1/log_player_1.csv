"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic.  Time is money, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
