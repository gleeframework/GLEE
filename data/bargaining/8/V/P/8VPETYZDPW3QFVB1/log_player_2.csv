Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic.  Time is money, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the time pressure."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is too lopsided.  Let's split it 60/40, acknowledging both the inflation pressure and the fact that I'll be the one making the proposal next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
