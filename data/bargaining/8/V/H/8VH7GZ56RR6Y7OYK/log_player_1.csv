"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can move on to the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round, where I can make a more substantial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slight cut to avoid losing more money in the next round.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll on my potential gains, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I expected, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself in future rounds."
