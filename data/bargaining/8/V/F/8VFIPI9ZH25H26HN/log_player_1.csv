"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0}

I'm proposing that I get all the money, and Bob gets nothing. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm not going to take a 50/50 split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more attractive offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
