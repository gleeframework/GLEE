"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}

Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, fair and square. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more even split than my initial offer! I'll consider it, but I'm not sure if I want to give up $500,000. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too even for me. I want more.""
