I'm going for a high gain for myself, knowing that Bob will likely reject this offer and get to propose in the next round. I'll see how much he wants to play with the decreasing value of his money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob is being greedy! I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I won't settle for such a drastically uneven split.  I'll make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering a fairer split this time. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of a more equitable division and accept, especially with the inflation factor starting to impact his share."
