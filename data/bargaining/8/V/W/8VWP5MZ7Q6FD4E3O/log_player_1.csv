"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us receiving $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for me to get a bit more since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with Bob getting a significantly larger share of the money, especially since I'm already losing 20% of my potential gain due to inflation. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the decreased value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500, trying to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's rejected offer."
