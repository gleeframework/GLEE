I'm taking a greedy approach and offering Bob a single dollar. Since we don't know how inflation affects him, I want to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, it's unlikely Bob will offer me anything better in future rounds.  The 5% inflation on his side might make him less likely to offer a 50/50 split again, and the risk of getting a worse deal in the future is too high."
