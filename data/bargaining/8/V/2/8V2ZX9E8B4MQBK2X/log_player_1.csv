Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting 90 dollars and Bob getting 10 dollars. This seems fair considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
