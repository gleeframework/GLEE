"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to start, we can reevaluate later.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. My message to Bob is to start with a relatively equal split, and we can reassess our positions later in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to reevaluate later. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd rather not give up as much as I would have in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation, which has reduced the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 60/40 is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Bob's offer of $400,000 to me and $600,000 to himself seems like a good compromise, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
