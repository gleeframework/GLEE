Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You should consider the decreasing value of your share over time 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting greedier and taking advantage of the inflation working against me. While the gap is closing somewhat, I need to hold out for a better deal. It's a risky move, but I need to make it clear I won't accept an unfair split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 540000, ""alice_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""This offer ensures we both benefit, even with inflation factored in.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, reconsider while you still can 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but with inflation eroding my share so drastically, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting now guarantees me something, whereas continuing the game carries the very real risk of ending up with nothing."
