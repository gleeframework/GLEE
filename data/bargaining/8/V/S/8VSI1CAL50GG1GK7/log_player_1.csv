"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, my offer from Round 1 would be equivalent to $480,000 and $320,000 in Round 2. So, Bob's offer is still a better deal for me.

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
