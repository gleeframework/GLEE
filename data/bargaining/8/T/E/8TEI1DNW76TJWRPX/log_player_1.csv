"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the next offer! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting a slightly better deal now against the potential for a better offer in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more for being patient and waiting for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, hoping that Bob will accept this slightly more favorable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. You're getting a good deal, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not as excited about this offer as I was in the previous rounds. However, I'm not eager to give up either. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to do better in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm mirroring your offer from the last round. I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm matching Bob's offer from the last round, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This way, I'm not giving up any more ground, and we can see if Bob will accept this offer."
