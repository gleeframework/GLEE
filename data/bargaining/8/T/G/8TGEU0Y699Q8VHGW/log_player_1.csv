"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering Bob $20, and I'll take $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing. My initial offer was $80, but now it's worth 80% of that, which is $64. Bob's offer is now $50, which is worth 80% of the original $50, so it's $40.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
