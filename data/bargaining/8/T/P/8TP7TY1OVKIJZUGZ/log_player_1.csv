I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a larger share,  it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this even split ensures I get something, and inflation is a significant factor."
