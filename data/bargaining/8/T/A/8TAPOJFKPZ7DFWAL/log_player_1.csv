Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose dividing the money equally, as we both stand to lose if we don't cooperate. Let's aim for mutual benefit. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
