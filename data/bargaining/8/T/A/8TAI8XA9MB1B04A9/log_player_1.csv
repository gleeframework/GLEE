Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too lopsided for my liking. How about a 55/45 split in your favor? This accounts for the time value of money, as you're losing value faster with each round. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
