"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's split this 90/10. You get a nice start, and I get the majority. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 100,000 is a decent amount, there's a lot more to be gained by continuing and potentially getting a better deal.  Since the value of the money will decrease for both of us with each round, I want to see if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  We both get a good chunk, and we don't have to risk the money decreasing further.""}
