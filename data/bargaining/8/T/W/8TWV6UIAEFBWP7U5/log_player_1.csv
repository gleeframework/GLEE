"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI hope Bob accepts this reasonable proposal. The message is brief and to the point, emphasizing the fairness of the division. Since this is the first round, there's no inflation to worry about yet, and both of us can benefit from ending the game early to maximize our gains. A 60-40 split seems like a good starting point, considering the game's dynamics. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer is not acceptable at this point. Given the impact of inflation, accepting this offer would mean I'd actually be getting less value than initially proposed, considering the 10% decrease in value for me. It's still early in the game, and I believe there's room for negotiation that could result in a more favorable split for me. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, aiming to find a better balance that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle.""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation, my aim is to find a compromise that acknowledges the decrease in value for both of us but still leans slightly in my favor to account for the greater depreciation on my side. A 52.5-47.5 split seems like a reasonable adjustment, considering we've both had a chance to propose and reject offers. The message emphasizes the need to find a middle ground, taking into account the inflation factor that affects us both but impacts me more significantly. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair adjustment and accept, ending the game before the value decreases further."
