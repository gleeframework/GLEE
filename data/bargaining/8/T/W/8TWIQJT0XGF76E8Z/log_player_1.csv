"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively fair split, and leaves Bob with 40%. I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more balanced split is better for both of us. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my offer would have been equivalent to 540,000 in the second round, so Bob's offer of 450,000 is a good compromise.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
