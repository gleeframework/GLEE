"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 7:3 ratio, with you receiving $3000. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm not happy with a 7:3 split, especially since the money is losing value. I'm going to try for a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a 55:45 split.  This is still a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money, and I'm willing to give you a larger share than you offered me.""}
