"Round 1
Alice's offer:

I'll reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I can likely get a better deal later on, especially with the inflation affecting Alice more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation will impact us both differently.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is being more generous than I was in the previous round. Taking into account the inflation, this offer is better than what I proposed, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the future rounds."
