"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $60 and give Bob $40, with the message ""Let's divide fairly!"" to initiate the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the 20% decrease in value for me due to inflation, accepting 50$ in the second round is actually less valuable than what I could potentially gain by negotiating further. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\nI've adjusted my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation that affects my gain but not Bob's. This offer reflects a compromise, giving Bob a bit more than the initial offer while still considering the impact of inflation on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to make progress. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, accepting 45$ now would mean a significant reduction in real value compared to the initial rounds. Since we are still in the early stages of negotiation and I believe there's room for further compromise, I'll reject this offer to push for a better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway on your last offer, considering inflation.""}\n\nI've taken into account Bob's last offer and the increasing pressure of inflation on my potential gain. By meeting him halfway on his offer from the last round, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us, while also being mindful of the decreasing value of the money I could receive."
