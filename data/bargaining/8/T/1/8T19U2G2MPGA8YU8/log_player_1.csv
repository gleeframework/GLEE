"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $55 and Bob will get $45. The message is a simple explanation that I'm trying to be fair but taking a bit more as I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think we can make this a little more equitable. How about we switch it up? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer because I initially offered him $45 and now he's offering me the same amount, while he gets more. Given that the value of money doesn't decrease for me, I can afford to wait for a better offer or try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly different offer, considering the inflation impact on Bob's gain. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob now (5% decrease in each round), I might be able to offer him a bit less while still appearing fair. My message will reflect an attempt to meet him halfway between our previous offers, while also considering the value decrease for him.\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is ticking, Alice.  Let's settle this fairly. This offer accounts for the dwindling value. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer again because, despite his mention of the dwindling value due to inflation, he's still offering me less than what I previously offered myself. Given that the money's value remains constant for me, I don't feel pressured by the inflation affecting Bob's side. I can continue negotiating for a better deal.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's gain. Since the value of money for Bob decreases by 5% each round and we're now in round 5, the total decrease for him is approximately 21.28% (1 - (1 - 0.05)^4). Given this significant decrease, I can offer him slightly less than before while still appearing reasonable. My message will acknowledge the urgency of the situation due to inflation but will also highlight the fairness of my offer given the circumstances.\n{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your gain, I believe this offer is more than fair.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The value is quickly disappearing.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer this time. Given that the money's value for me hasn't changed and Bob is now offering an even split, it seems like a reasonable deal, especially since he's feeling the pressure of the decreasing value on his side. There's little to be gained from further negotiation, and accepting this offer ensures I get a fair share without risking Bob making a worse offer in the next round due to the increasing impact of inflation on his side.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###"
