Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that favors me slightly, but still gives him a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very greedy! I'm not going to accept such a small share, especially since the money is losing value. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I'm going to offer Bob a more balanced deal this time.  I'm willing to give him a larger share, but I need to make sure I get enough to avoid getting nothing at all."
