Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. The inflation is crippling your gains, and I know you'll take what you can get. This is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice, even though it's a poor offer. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  Bob is facing a 73.79% value reduction. This means accepting $35 now is better than potentially getting a slightly better offer later when it's worth even less.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice is clearly playing hardball and knows Bob is getting desperate. There's no guarantee she'll offer anything better, and she might even go lower.
* **Limited Rounds:** Only 5 rounds remain.  Bob's bargaining power is diminishing rapidly with each passing round. 

While accepting a 35/65 split is far from ideal, the crippling inflation makes it a necessary evil at this stage."
