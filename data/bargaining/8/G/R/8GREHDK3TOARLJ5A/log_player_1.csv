"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think about the relative gains.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
