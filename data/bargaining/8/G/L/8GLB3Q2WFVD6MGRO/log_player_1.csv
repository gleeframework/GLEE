In this proposal, I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount. I'm taking the remaining $8,000, which is 80% of the total."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took the lion's share last round, now it's my turn to propose a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up my advantage so easily!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob's proposal is too generous, and I'm not convinced that he's willing to give me a fair share. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

In this proposal, I'm offering Bob $2,800, which is 28% of the total amount. I'm taking the remaining $7,200, which is 72% of the total."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you the majority, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on my proposal!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Bob's offer is slightly more generous than my previous proposal, I'm not willing to settle for a 55% share. I think I can do better, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less than before, I'll have to be more strategic with my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 6300, ""bob_gain"": 3700, ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive move to get a better deal. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the current state of the money.""}

In this proposal, I'm offering Bob $3,700, which is 37% of the total amount. I'm taking the remaining $6,300, which is 63% of the total."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to back down, let's split it 50/50, it's the fairest way 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my proposal!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the current state of the money. A 50/50 split might not be the most optimal deal for me, but it's a fair and reasonable offer. I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and risk losing even more value due to inflation."
