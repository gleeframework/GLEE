"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A decent start, but I think I can do better. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my valuation accordingly. With the new numbers, I'm looking at a gain of $600,000, which is equivalent to $570,000 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a significant amount, but I'm not getting the majority of the money. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing me to the limit, Bob! I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not budging much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant portion of the money for myself."
