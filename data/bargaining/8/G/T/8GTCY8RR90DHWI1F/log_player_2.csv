Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Time to take a bigger share, considering the decreasing value of money 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise, but we both need to consider the inflation that will affect the value of the money in future rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance to accept, or I'll take it all 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While this offer is very unfavorable, considering the 59% inflation, taking 15 dollars is better than nothing at this point. There's a high chance Alice will take everything in the next round."
