,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's not quite what I had in mind.  How about we try 65/35 my way this time?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"I'm willing to go up to 70/30.  It's the best I can do, given how much the money is losing value with each round.  What do you say?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, the inflation is hurting you more than me. Let's be realistic and go back to my initial offer of 60/40. It's a good deal for you in the long run.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
25.0,75.0,"I'm upping my offer to 75/25.  This is my final offer, as the inflation is getting out of control.  Let's be reasonable and come to an agreement.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
