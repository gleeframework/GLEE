"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  I want to start with a generous offer to see if he's willing to take it.  However, I'm aware of the inflation, so I'm keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the inflation rate is making the value of money decrease rapidly.  It's better to get half now than risk getting nothing later."
