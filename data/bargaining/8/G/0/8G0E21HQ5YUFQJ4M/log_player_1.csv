"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```
I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I'm now considering a lower amount for myself. But Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```"
