Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is my bottom line.  The inflation difference is significant, and we need to account for it.  Let's close this out and get something.

# Alice gain: 5700

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is becoming the less risky option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Alice. This gives her a strong incentive to settle sooner.
* **Alice's Stance:** She's made it clear this is her ""bottom line,"" implying she's unlikely to move much further.
* **Time Pressure:**  We have only 7 rounds left. Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds carries the significant risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement. 

It's a tough call, but at this point, accepting a less than ideal offer is preferable to potentially walking away with nothing."
