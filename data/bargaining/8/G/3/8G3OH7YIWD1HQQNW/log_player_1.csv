"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 1/10 and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and taking $9,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better. Let's split it 2:8 for now. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob each round, I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the one with the better offer. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent chunk of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting any more generous, so I'll try to meet you halfway. But I'm still not giving up. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth less for Bob each round, I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. It's not the best deal I could get, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
