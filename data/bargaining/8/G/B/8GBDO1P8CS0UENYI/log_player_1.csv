```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more careful. Since Bob's offer is still a 70-30 split, I'll reject it.

I'm hoping to get a better deal next round!"

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value so quickly, I'm getting a bit desperate too! But I'm not sure I want to split it down the middle, especially since Bob's gain is worth less to him due to the 48.8% depreciation.

```

I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but it's getting tough!"

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give in, but I think I'm being too generous 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting closer to a 3:1 split! I'm not sure I want to accept a deal that's so skewed in his favor, especially since the money is worth even less to me now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal, but I'm starting to get worried that we'll run out of time!"

Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting even more extreme! A 90-10 split is a huge concession, but I'm not sure I want to accept it. I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to bluff me into accepting a bad deal.

```
{

}
```

I'll take the $100, but I'm not proud of the way this negotiation ended."
