**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation rate is heavily stacked against me.  Each round sees a significant decrease in the value of my potential gain. Delaying further only hurts me more.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I held out hope for a better offer from Bob, the continually shrinking value due to inflation makes the potential gains negligible.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems content to drag this out, knowing time is on his side. He's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this. 

Accepting a 30% share (which will be worth even less due to inflation) is far from ideal. However, it's better to secure something now rather than risk ending up with a much smaller amount later."
