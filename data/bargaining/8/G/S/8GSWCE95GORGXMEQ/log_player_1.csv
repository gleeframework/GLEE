The inflation is starting to hurt.  I'm still going to try to get a better deal though.  It's still early in the game and I don't want to settle for too little."

The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm trying to strike a balance between securing a large portion of the money and ensuring that Bob doesn't completely give up.  A 950,000/50,000 split is a decent compromise, hopefully he'll see it that way."

Bob is still offering me a relatively small amount, even with the inflation. I need to try to get a better deal.  I still believe we can reach a compromise that is fair to both of us.  I'm not willing to settle for anything less than 500,000 at this point.  We only have 2 rounds left, so the stakes are getting higher."

It's getting really tight.  The inflation is a huge factor now, and it's making it hard to get a good deal. I'm going to try to split the money more evenly this time, which should make Bob more likely to accept. We are both getting close to the end game, so I need to show flexibility and try to reach an agreement before we both end up with nothing."
