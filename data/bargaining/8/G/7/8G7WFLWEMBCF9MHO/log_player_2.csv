Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise a bit. 80% for me, 20% for you.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. 20% isn't enough for me to feel like it's worth it. Let's see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
