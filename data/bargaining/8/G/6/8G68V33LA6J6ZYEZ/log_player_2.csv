"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I think this split is fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is reasonable, but I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than the previous offer. Let's split it more evenly, and we can both get more money!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear the clock is ticking louder for you than for me. Let's be realistic and settle this. 
# Bob gain: 3520 
# Alice gain: 6480 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is hurting me significantly, and it's likely to get worse in the next round. I'll accept this offer."
