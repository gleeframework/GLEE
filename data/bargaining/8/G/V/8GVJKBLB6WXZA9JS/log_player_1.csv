Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty lopsided deal in the first round. I want to maximize my gain in the first round since the money is worth the most to me now.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is still lopsided, the inflation rate is going to hit me harder in the following rounds.  It's better to take the $10 now than risk getting nothing in the end."
