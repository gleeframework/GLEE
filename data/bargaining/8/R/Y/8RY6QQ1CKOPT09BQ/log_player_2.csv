"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we'll have many more chances to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice proposes a ""fair deal"", it's a highly unequal one.  There's a lot of time left in the game and the inflation factor is unknown, making this offer too risky.  Let's see if we can negotiate something more balanced in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I'm open to a fair split. Let's start with 450k for me and 550k for you. We can adjust it later if needed.""
