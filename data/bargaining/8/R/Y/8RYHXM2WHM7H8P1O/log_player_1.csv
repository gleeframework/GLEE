Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Bob's offer is still not good enough for me.  He's not offering me as much as my previous proposal, and the clock is ticking.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm making a final effort to find common ground.  This offer is closer to Bob's last proposal, and it's the best I can do given the time constraints and the diminishing value of the money.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I will accept this offer.  With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing at all is too high.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, even if it's not my ideal outcome."
