"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small share to get something right away.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but it still leaves me with a smaller share.  I'm going to reject this and try to get a better deal in the next round.  I'm hoping the inflation will push him to make a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I'm going to stick with a slightly higher share for myself, but I'm reducing my offer a bit to see if Bob is willing to compromise. Inflation is starting to take its toll, and I don't want to risk getting nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation is hitting me hard, Bob's offer is starting to look more appealing.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might end up with nothing.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure at least some of the money."
