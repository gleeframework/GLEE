"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. It's a good starting point and gives me a significant advantage.  I'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still a considerable amount of money. However, I'm not willing to settle for a 30% loss in my potential gain. I'm going to hold out for a better offer, hoping to get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a large share of the money. I hope Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers could lead to a worse outcome for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a significant decrease from my ideal outcome, Bob's offer is still better than what I would get after another round of rejection and inflation. I'm accepting the offer.  It's important to be realistic and secure some of the money, rather than risk getting nothing."
