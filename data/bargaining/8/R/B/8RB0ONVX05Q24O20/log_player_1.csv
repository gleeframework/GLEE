"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, with a message encouraging fairness and reasonableness in our negotiations. It's the first round, and I want to start with a relatively balanced offer to set a positive tone for our interaction. I'm also considering the impact of inflation on our offers and want to make a deal before the money loses too much value. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more equitable split this time. Let's close the deal before inflation eats into the value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's proposal seems more equitable on the surface, considering the effects of inflation, the actual value we both gain is less than in the first round. Given that my gain is worth 10% less and his is worth 20% less, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round or aim to minimize the loss due to inflation by making a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me. Let's proceed to the next round and see how negotiations unfold!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's settle this quickly.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself, emphasizing the urgency of settling the deal quickly due to the devaluing effects of inflation on the money. My strategy is to be more assertive in my proposal while still leaving room for Bob to accept, given that the longer we negotiate, the less the money is worth to both of us, but more significantly to Bob. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer still gives you a larger share, but accounts for the shrinking pot. Let's be pragmatic and wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, with my gain being worth 27.1% less and Bob's gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. Although I aimed for a higher share initially, the progressive decrease in value due to inflation makes this offer more reasonable. Bob's message emphasizes pragmatism and the need to conclude the negotiations, which aligns with my assessment that further rounds would only lead to diminishing returns for both of us. Accepting this offer seems to be the most practical decision at this stage."
