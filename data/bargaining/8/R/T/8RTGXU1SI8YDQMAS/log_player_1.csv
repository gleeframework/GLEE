I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal.  Although the money is getting worth less, I'm not ready to settle for such a lopsided split yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm taking a risk, but I'm hoping that Bob will start to get concerned about the dwindling value of the money.  He's getting a pretty good deal right now, but it's only going to get worse for him if we keep going."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair, and the value of the money is decreasing for both of us. I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm making a bold move here, but I'm going to try to get a larger share of the money.  Bob's offers have been getting worse, and the value of the money is diminishing quickly.  I'm hoping he realizes that it's better to accept a slightly less favorable deal than to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is incredibly unfair, and I'm not going to accept it. Even though the value of the money is dropping rapidly, I'm not willing to give up almost everything.  It's better to get nothing than to accept such a bad deal."
