"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 5% less, this offer is actually more favorable to me than the previous one.

I accept Bob's offer.
