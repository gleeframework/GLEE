"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money equally, with each of us receiving $500000. This ensures fairness and avoids potential negotiations leading to inflation issues. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
