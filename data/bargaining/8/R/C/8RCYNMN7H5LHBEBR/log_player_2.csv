"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is very unfair, and while I understand the risk of inflation, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal.  I'm going to try and negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split.  I think this is fair, considering the risk of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I agree with a more balanced split. Here's a proposal that considers the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still not an even split, Alice is moving in the right direction, and I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further inflation and potentially getting nothing."
