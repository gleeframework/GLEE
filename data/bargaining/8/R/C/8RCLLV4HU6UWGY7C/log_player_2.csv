Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're both being stubborn.  Let's end this with a simple, even split. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the best move for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is rapidly losing value for both players.  Each round significantly diminishes returns, and Bob is being hit harder (losing 18.55% of value this round alone).
* **Alice's Desperation:** Alice's offer suggests increasing desperation.  She's gone from aiming for a 65/35 split in her favor to a 50/50 split. This indicates she likely won't go much lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round isn't worth the risk.  Alice might offer even less, and the value of the money will continue to plummet.

Taking the 50/50 split ensures Bob gets something substantial before inflation further erodes the value."
