"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both receive $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, as I was hoping for a more equal division.

After considering the options, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the knowledge that Bob's money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll make a new proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, with me receiving 42% and Bob receiving 58%. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant decrease in value of Bob's money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the game dragging on and the value of my share decreasing.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 30% and hope that Bob will be satisfied with the deal."
