"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share since I'm taking more of the inflation hit. Let's make this fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
