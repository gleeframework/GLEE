"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I need to consider the value of the offer carefully.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to split the $10,000 evenly between us."
