"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to keep most of the money! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $5000 gain in the first round is still worth $5000, but Bob's gain is now worth 10% less, which means he's offering me $6000 that's equivalent to $5400 in the first round.

Considering this, I'm not too thrilled about the offer. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent chunk of the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, 27.1% less than the original amount is a significant drop! Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain in this offer is worth around $3600 in the first round.

Given that my gain in this offer is $4500, which is worth $4500 in the first round, I think I can do a bit better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, 40.95% less than the original amount is a huge drop! Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain in this offer is worth around $3060 in the first round.

Given that my gain in this offer is $5800, which is worth $5800 in the first round, I think this is a decent offer. I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.
