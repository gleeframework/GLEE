"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I believe is a reasonable and fair share. Since the money's value decreases with each round, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further losses. The message ""Let's make a fair deal!"" aims to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to accept the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, since we both have to deal with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he claims it's fair to split the money evenly, his proposal actually gives him 60% of the total amount, which is more than what I offered him in the first round. Considering the inflation rates, I'm losing more value than Bob with each passing round, so I need to be cautious with my decision. By rejecting this offer, I'll get the chance to make a new proposal in the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob 45% of the total amount, while I take 55%. This proposal is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. By suggesting we ""find a middle ground,"" I'm trying to convey a sense of cooperation and willingness to negotiate, hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this deal rather than risking further losses due to inflation."
