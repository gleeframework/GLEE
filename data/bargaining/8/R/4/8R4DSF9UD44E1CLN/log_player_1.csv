"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you half, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll think about it for a moment... 

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 50-50 split is in my best interest, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation still affecting the value of the money, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me this time, considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping to get a bit more value out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 52-48 is a fair split, considering the current value of the money. It's better than what I would get in the next round, and it's a reasonable compromise. I'll take it!"
