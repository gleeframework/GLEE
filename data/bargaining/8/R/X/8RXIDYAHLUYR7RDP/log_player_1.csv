"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%. This way, we both get a good chunk and can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm aiming to get the majority of the money upfront, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount to negotiate from."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split. Let's see if you'll accept a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, and I need to think carefully about the next move.

Since Bob is offering a 50/50 split, I'll consider it a fair deal, but I can do better. I'll reject the offer and try to get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a slightly better deal for myself. I'll offer 55% to myself and 45% to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think I deserve a slight edge. How about we split it 55/45?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 40/60 is a more reasonable split. Let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value, but I need to think strategically.

Bob is offering a 40/60 split, which is a bit better than his previous offer. However, I can still do better. I'll reject the offer and try to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of Bob's willingness to negotiate. Since he's offering a 40/60 split, I'll try to push for an even more favorable deal. I'll offer 60/40, but I'll make it more enticing by framing it as a ""generous"" offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous, Bob! I'll give you a 40% share, but I think I deserve the majority. Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```

I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and make Bob think that 60/40 is a ""generous"" offer, when in reality, I'm actually getting a better deal than he's been offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think 35/65 is a more reasonable split. Let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value, and I need to be strategic about my next move.

Bob is offering a 35/65 split, which is a bit better than his previous offer. However, I think I can do better. I'll reject the offer and try to get an even more favorable deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of Bob's willingness to negotiate. Since he's offering a 35/65 split, I'll try to push for an even more favorable deal. I'll offer 70/30, but I'll make it sound like I'm being generous by framing it as a ""final offer"" and implying that I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. I'm being generous and giving you 30% of the remaining money. If you don't accept, I'm walking away and we'll both get nothing. The choice is yours.""
