# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the effective gains in this round. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000, but due to the 20% inflation, it's effectively worth $3,200.
