"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $380,000 in the first round. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $540,000 in the first round.

Considering the slight decrease in my share, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. But, I'm not sure I'm ready to accept it yet. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still leaving a decent chunk for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $300,000 is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $857,400 in the first round.
Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 73% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $730,000 in the first round.

Considering the significant decrease in my share, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm not sure I want to reject it either. I'll have to think carefully about it. After some consideration, I'll decide to accept the offer.
