"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. Let's split it evenly at $50 each.  This avoids further losses from inflation and gets us both a fair amount. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
