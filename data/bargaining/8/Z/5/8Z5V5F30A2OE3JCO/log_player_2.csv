"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share, but I'm open to discussion. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not going to accept that offer. It's too lopsided in Alice's favor, and even though I don't know how the inflation will affect her, I'm not going to start by giving away 90% of the money. I'll make a counter offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable given we both have equal say in the decision. Let's talk.""}
