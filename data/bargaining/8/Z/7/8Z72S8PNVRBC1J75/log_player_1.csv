"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the impact of inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, $4000 is now equivalent to $4,000 / 0.9 = $4444.44 in the original value.

Similarly, since the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, $6000 is now equivalent to $6000 / 0.8 = $7500 in the original value.

I'll reject this offer since I prefer to get more in the original value.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to Round 1, I'll aim to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming to get a bit more than half of the original $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the original value of the amounts in Round 4.

Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, $4800 is now equivalent to $4800 / 0.271 = $17,686.11 in the original value.

Similarly, since the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less, $5200 is now equivalent to $5200 / 0.488 = $10,645.31 in the original value.

I'll accept this offer since I get a larger share in the original value.
