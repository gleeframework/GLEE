"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a fair split, but I'm also aware that the money is worth less to me with each round. I'll keep an eye on the inflation and adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep a larger share, the inflation makes it increasingly difficult for me to get a better deal. Accepting this offer secures a decent amount, even with the discount."
