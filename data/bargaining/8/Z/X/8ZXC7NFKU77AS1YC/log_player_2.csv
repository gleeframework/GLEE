Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting anxious and increasingly unwilling to let the game continue.  While the offer is still heavily skewed in her favor,  my negotiating position improves with every round. It's risky, but I think I can push her further."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, enough is enough.  We're past the point of games. A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Let's end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing my luck a bit, but Alice's desperation is palpable. Offering a 50/50 split might seem risky, but it projects confidence and fairness. It's a strong anchoring point for the remaining rounds if she rejects it, as she'll be hard-pressed to justify taking significantly more than half now."
