"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Your split was a bit too rich for me. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away more of your share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. 58-42 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while inflation is quickly eroding the value of the money.  While her offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, it's heavily skewed in her favor when considering the declining value.  I need to push for a more significant change in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the clock is working against us.  I'm proposing 52/48 – it's a reasonable compromise, and we both need to agree before inflation eats away at this any further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced by your offers, Bob. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your last one. 56-44, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's still heavily overvaluing her position.  A 56-44 split might have been tempting a few rounds ago, but the value of the money has decreased significantly. It's time to show Alice I'm serious about getting a more equitable deal, even if it means walking away with nothing.  The next offer will have to be my last, best offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. 51/49.  It's more than fair considering how much value we've both lost to inflation.  If you reject this, I'm walking away – I'd rather have nothing than be insulted by your lowball offers.""}
