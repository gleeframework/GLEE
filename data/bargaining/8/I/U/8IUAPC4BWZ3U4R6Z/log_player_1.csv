Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth isn't helping either of us. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Waiting longer means getting even less in real terms.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently rejected offers favoring Alice and proposed a 50/50 split. This suggests he's unlikely to accept anything less favorable to him in future rounds.
* **Certainty:** Accepting guarantees a reasonable share, whereas rejecting risks getting a much smaller amount if Bob proposes an even less favorable split in later rounds.

While a 50/50 split wasn't the initial goal, it's important to adapt to the game's dynamics and make the most advantageous decision considering the circumstances."
