"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start""}

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're just starting out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I think this is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 45/55 is a more reasonable split""}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping that he'll accept this offer."
