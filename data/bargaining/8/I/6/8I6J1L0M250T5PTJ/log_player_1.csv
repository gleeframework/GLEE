"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. This leaves me with $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the actual values are:
Alice gain: $45 (50 * 0.9)
Bob gain: $45

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split, which is quite even. However, I'm not sure if I can do better in future rounds.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so it's worth 90% of the value of round 2.

My proposal for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This leaves me with a slightly larger share, but still gives Bob a significant portion of the money."
