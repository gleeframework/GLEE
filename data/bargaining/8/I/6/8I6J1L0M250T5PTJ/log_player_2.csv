Let's see what I can do better!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
``` 
Let's start with a fair split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, this is a better offer than the 20% I would get if we go to the next round."
