I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, giving myself a large portion of the money.  Since the game is about maximizing our gains, I'm going to try to secure as much as I can right away.  I'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

This is a much fairer offer than the first round, and while I'm not thrilled about taking a 5% loss on my potential earnings, I'm not confident I can do much better in the long run. It's better to take a smaller loss now and guarantee myself half the money."
