"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer is designed to be enticing for Bob while still securing a significant portion of the money for Alice. The 5% inflation will only impact Bob's portion in the next round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the money is worth less to me with each passing round. I'm confident I can get a better deal than a 50/50 split, especially considering Bob rejected my initial offer.  Let's see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy to round 1 but adjust the offer to reflect the decreased value of money. This offers Bob a chance to earn a good sum while still allowing me to maintain a significant share.  Let's see if he's willing to accept a slightly less generous offer this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly less favorable, and with the compounding effect of inflation, the value of his offer to me is significantly lower than it appears.  I'm still confident I can secure a better deal. I'll stick to my strategy of offering a large share to Bob, hoping he'll accept before the value of the money drops further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to continue my strategy of offering a large portion to Bob, hoping he'll accept before the inflation rate makes the deal too unattractive for him. This time I'm reducing my share by another 100,000, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  The longer we go on, the worse the deal will be for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable, and the inflation is severely impacting the value of the money to me.  I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share further to 700,000, offering Bob a more substantial portion. The inflation rate is becoming a serious problem, and I need to make a deal quickly to salvage a good outcome for myself. This offer gives Bob a good chunk of the money while still leaving me with a significant share. Hopefully, he'll finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and the inflation is severely hurting the value of the money for me. I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better split. I'm sticking with my strategy of offering a large portion to Bob, hoping that he'll finally realize that it's better to accept a fair deal than to risk getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share one more time to 600,000, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  We're running out of time, and the inflation is becoming a critical factor. I'm starting to worry that we might both end up with nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming completely unreasonable, and the inflation is making the value of the money even worse for me. I'm still holding onto hope that I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better split. I'm going to stick with my strategy of offering a large portion to Bob, hoping that he'll finally see reason and accept a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  I'm going to make a last-ditch effort to reach a compromise by offering an equal split.  I'm hoping that Bob realizes that we're both on the brink of getting nothing, and he'll accept this offer."
