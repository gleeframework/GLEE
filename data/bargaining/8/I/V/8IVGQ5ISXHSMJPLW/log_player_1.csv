"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm making a generous offer, but I'm also trying to get a decent chunk of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious with my share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 55% of the remaining value. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, 50/50 split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a fair split that doesn't favor either of us too much."
