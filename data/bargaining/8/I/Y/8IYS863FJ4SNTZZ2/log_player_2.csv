"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer, even though it seems fair. The inflation means I might get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a slight advantage this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you think it's unfair.  Let's see if we can find a compromise!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept it! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, I'm accepting Alice's offer. The inflation is starting to hurt, and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round."
