Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation, but I'm not going to lose money just because of it.  Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the bigger share since I'm not losing any value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
