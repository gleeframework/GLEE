"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a good deal before the money loses value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value at a 10% rate, my gain of 5000 is now worth 90% of what it would have been in the previous round, which is 4500. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to get more than 4500."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 90% of what it was in round 2, so my gain of 5500 would be worth 90% of 4500, which is 4050.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 60% to me and 40% to Bob, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think we should both aim for a fairer split than your last offer. Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value at a 27.1% rate, my gain of 4500 is worth 72.9% of what it would have been in the first round, which is 7290.

However, considering the current value of the money, I think Bob's offer is reasonable. I'd rather accept this offer and get a guaranteed amount than risk waiting for another round and potentially getting less.
