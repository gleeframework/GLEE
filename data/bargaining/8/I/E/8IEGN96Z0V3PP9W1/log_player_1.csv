"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, will take 80% of the initial $100, and Bob will take 20%. The message is a friendly invitation to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it. No negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the 50-50 split. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to the previous offer. Hope you'll consider this one.""
}
```

This offer suggests that I'll take 60% of the current $100, and Bob will take 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect it to last. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the new offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the 45-55 split. I'd like to propose a new offer, hoping to get a better deal before the money becomes even less valuable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to get a decent deal. Don't let it slip away!""
}
```

This offer suggests that I'll take 55% of the current $100, and Bob will take 45%. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob before the money becomes even less valuable due to inflation."
