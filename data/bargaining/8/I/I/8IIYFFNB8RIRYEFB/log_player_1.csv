Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

``` 
I'll accept the offer.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is hitting me hard and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round."
