I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I want to get a bigger share to compensate for the loss in value. But I don't want to be too greedy, or Bob might reject my next offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Given the significant decrease in value, I'll consider Bob's offer carefully. Since the difference between our proposed shares is relatively small, I'll think about accepting this offer to avoid further losses.
