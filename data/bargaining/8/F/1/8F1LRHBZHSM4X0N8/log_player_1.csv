I'll start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can finish the game quickly.  It's risky, but I'm hoping to show good faith and get this over with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is clearly trying to be greedy. I'm not going to accept such a low offer. I'll wait to see if he's willing to be more fair in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and hopefully Bob will realize that continuing to be greedy won't get him anywhere."
