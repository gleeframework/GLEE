"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40.  This seems fair since I'm hit harder by inflation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  I'm taking a slight cut from your offer, but the next round we'll both get less because of inflation. Let's try to find a more agreeable split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a better deal, but your offer was too low. I'm willing to come down a little, but this needs to be reasonable for both of us. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
