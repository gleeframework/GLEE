"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm also being practical. Let's get this over with quickly. Accept and we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's best to see if we can do better.  There are many rounds to go, and since the value of the money decreases for Alice, she might be willing to negotiate more in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more fairly. We both have time to negotiate, and I believe we can find a more equitable solution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure a significant portion for myself as the value decreases with each round. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
