"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money 60/40. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""That's not a great deal for me. I'm feeling the pinch of inflation already. Let's make this fair and equitable.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favors her. Accepting it would leave Bob with significantly less, especially considering the inflation working against him. 
* **Counter-offer:** Bob's counter-offer aims for a slightly more favorable split for himself (52/48). While this is still a reasonable split, it acknowledges the time pressure caused by inflation.
* **Message:** The message aims to be firm but fair, highlighting the need for a more balanced agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting you harder each round.  I'm offering a 55/45 split to settle this fairly before your share shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Inflation is steadily eroding Bob's potential gains. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, waiting longer will only make things worse for Bob.
* **Improved Offer:** Alice has moved slightly in Bob's favor from her initial 60/40 proposal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Alice offering even less in subsequent rounds, as she knows time is on her side. Accepting guarantees Bob at least 45% of the original amount, which is better than what he might end up with if he continues to gamble."
