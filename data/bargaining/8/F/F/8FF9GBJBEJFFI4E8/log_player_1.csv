"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $900,000 is now worth $810,000.

Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
