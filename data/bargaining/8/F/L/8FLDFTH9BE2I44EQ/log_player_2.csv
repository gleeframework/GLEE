Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the time pressure is on, accepting an offer significantly less than half isn't wise. I'm betting Alice is getting anxious and will make a better offer soon.  We're past the halfway point, so the risk of getting nothing is increasing, but it's a calculated risk."
