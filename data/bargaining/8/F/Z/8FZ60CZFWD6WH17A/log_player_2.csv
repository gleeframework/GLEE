"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but my offer in this round ensures a better outcome for you than if you wait longer.""}
``` 
 
My reasoning is as follows:

* **Exploit Time Pressure:** Alice's value for the money decreases faster than mine.  Delaying an agreement hurts her more.
* **Appear Reasonable, But Firm:** Offering her slightly less than what she wanted in the previous round might be tempting enough, especially with the looming devaluation.
* **Avoid Extreme Proposals:** A 50/50 split might seem fair, but it doesn't capitalize on the fact that time is on my side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'd prefer a larger share, waiting any longer significantly erodes the value of the money for both of us.
* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to a more even split, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in future rounds is risky.  There's no guarantee Alice will offer more favorable terms, and the value will continue to decrease."
