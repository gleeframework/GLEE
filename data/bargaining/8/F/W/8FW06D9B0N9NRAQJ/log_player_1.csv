Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor.  Since the money depreciates, I want to secure as much as possible early on, even if it means Bob might reject it.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being very greedy! While his offer is better than mine was in the first round, it's still extremely unfair.  I'm going to reject this and hope I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but this time I'm offering Bob a more reasonable share.  Inflation is starting to bite, so I need to find a balance between getting a good deal for myself and ensuring Bob doesn't walk away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While it's still less than I'd like, the inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
