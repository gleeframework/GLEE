"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  While I want a big share, I'm also hoping to incentivize Bob to accept so we don't have to deal with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, Bob's offer is still way too low.  I'm hoping he'll realize we're both going to lose more money the longer this goes on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm still aiming for a big chunk of the money, but I'm increasing Bob's share slightly to make the offer more appealing.  We're both losing money with each round, and I want to show I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Inflation is biting into my potential gains, but Bob is still offering a ridiculously low share.  Hopefully, he'll start to see that we're both losing out with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a more balanced offer this time, as inflation is becoming a serious factor.  I'm hoping Bob realizes that we're both better off dividing the money fairly before we lose too much more."
