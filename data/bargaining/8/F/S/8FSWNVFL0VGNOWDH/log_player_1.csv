"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that if Bob rejects, he'll have to offer me something in the next round and face a 20% reduction in the overall value.  It's a good starting point to see if he's open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a 50/50 split, and while the money is worth less now, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting less in the next round."
