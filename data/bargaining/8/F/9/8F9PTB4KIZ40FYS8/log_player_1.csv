"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, I'll take the first 60 and you can have the remaining 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be fair and split it 60/40. I'll take the 60 this time, but I'm open to negotiating in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like the idea of Bob getting 60 and me getting 40, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less now, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I think we should split it 50/50 this time, considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will agree to meet me halfway."
