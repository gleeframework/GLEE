"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share this time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept an immediate split, remember the game dynamics! Each round, Alice's money is worth less, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal later on. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money more evenly, considering the potential for inflation to impact your share more in the future. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is becoming more desperate, and her share is losing value rapidly. While I'd prefer a more even split, this offer is pretty good, and I don't want to risk losing out entirely."
