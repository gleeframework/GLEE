"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I think I'll take it. My share is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's share is worth 5% less. Since it's a 50/50 split, I'll accept this offer to avoid risking a worse deal in the next round.
