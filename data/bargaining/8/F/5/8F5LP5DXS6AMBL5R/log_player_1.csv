"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money into $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This way, we can share the funds fairly while considering the decreasing value of money in future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a slightly more even split,  $5500 for me and $4500 for you. This way, we both get a better starting amount while still taking inflation into account.  Let's get this done before things get worse! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
