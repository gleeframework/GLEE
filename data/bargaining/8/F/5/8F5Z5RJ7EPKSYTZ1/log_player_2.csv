"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. I'm offering you 40% which is a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was tempting Alice, but the inflation makes it a bad deal for me in the long run. Let's be realistic, how about a 55/45 split in my favor?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your sense of reality is a bit skewed. I offered you a fair deal in the beginning.  I'll take the 55/45 split but in my favor this time.  Take it or leave it - the deal will be worse for you if we go another round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, Alice has called my bluff.  If I reject this offer, the potential gains in future rounds will likely be outweighed by the increasing inflation. Accepting secures me a reasonable sum considering the circumstances.
