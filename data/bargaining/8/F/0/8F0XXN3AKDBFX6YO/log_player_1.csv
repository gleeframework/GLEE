"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation kicking in, I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining value, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
