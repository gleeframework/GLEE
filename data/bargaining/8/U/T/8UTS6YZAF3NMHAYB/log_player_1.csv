"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of 50 is actually worth $45 (0.9 x 50).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
