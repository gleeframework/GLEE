"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}\n\nSince it's the first round, I want to start with a reasonable and slightly favorable offer to myself, taking into account that Bob might be eager to close the deal early to avoid the inflation penalty. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer.\n\n###  \n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###  \n\n(I'll make sure to keep track of the rounds and adjust my strategy accordingly.)\n\n###  \n\nAlso, just to confirm, if Bob rejects the offer, it will be his turn to make a proposal, and I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it, right? And if we reach the 12th round without an agreement, we both get nothing? Just want to make sure I understand the rules correctly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value decreases quickly for you. This is a better offer, let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money decreases quickly for me, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Bob is also affected by inflation, albeit at a slower rate, he may be willing to compromise further in the next rounds. Additionally, accepting 45% of the original amount after just two rounds might not be the best outcome for me. I'll try to push for a more favorable offer in the next round.\n\n###  \n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision and we can proceed to the next round.\n\n###  \n\n(Remember, I'll be making the proposal in the next round.)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and be done with it!""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to decrease my initial offer slightly, taking into account the inflation penalty I've incurred so far. I'm hoping that by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his previous offer, we can come to a mutually acceptable agreement. The message is designed to convey a sense of compromise and urgency, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and end the game.\n\n###  \n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to my offer.\n\n###  \n\n(I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds.)\n\n###  \n\nAlso, I'd like to confirm that the inflation penalty will continue to apply to both of us in subsequent rounds, correct? The 20% decrease for me and the 5% decrease for Bob will be cumulative, right?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  The clock is ticking and the money is rapidly losing value. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, I'm not convinced that this is the best deal I can get. Bob's message comes across as somewhat aggressive, which might be a tactic to pressure me into accepting the offer. However, I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating, hoping to get a better outcome.\n\n###  \n\nAdditionally, since Bob claims this is his ""final offer,"" I'm curious to see if he'll actually stick to that statement or be willing to make further concessions in the next rounds. I'll make another proposal in the next round, trying to find a more favorable agreement.\n\n###  \n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision, and we'll proceed to the next round.\n\n###  \n\n(I'll keep in mind the cumulative inflation penalty and adjust my strategy accordingly.)\n\n###  \n\nAlso, I'd like to confirm that if we reach the 12th round without an agreement, we both get nothing, regardless of any previous offers or claims of ""final offers,"" correct?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair split. Inflation is killing me!""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make a bold move and offer a 50-50 split, despite the fact that the value of the money has decreased significantly for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see the fairness in this offer and accept it, considering that he's also losing value due to inflation, albeit at a slower rate.\n\n###  \n\nMy message is designed to convey a sense of urgency and emphasize the importance of reaching an agreement soon. By stating that this is the ""last chance for a fair split,"" I'm trying to create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) and encourage Bob to accept the offer.\n\n###  \n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to my offer. I'm eager to see if he'll accept this proposal or if we'll need to continue negotiating.\n\n###  \n\n(Remember, the inflation penalty will continue to apply to both of us in subsequent rounds, so time is of the essence!)"
