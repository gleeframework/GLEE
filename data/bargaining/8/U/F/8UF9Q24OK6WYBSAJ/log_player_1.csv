"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and equal start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I think Bob's proposal is a reasonable one. I'll accept his offer.
