"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a fair split, but I believe we can do better. This offer reflects a more balanced division, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While she's proposing what seems like a ""fair"" 70/30 split, the decreasing value of the money means she's getting a much better deal over time.  We need to push for a more advantageous split quickly."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. This offer is a step in the right direction, but I believe we can both do even better.  Let's keep negotiating, and I'm sure we'll find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her strategy of offering seemingly ""fair"" splits while benefiting from the decreasing value of the money. We need to make it clear that we're not falling for this tactic. Rejecting this offer shows Alice we're serious about getting a genuinely advantageous deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is more than generous, considering the inflation working against you. Let's be pragmatic and finalize this.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, with time running out, let's be practical and split the money evenly.  This is a fair solution that ensures we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the best we're likely to get at this point.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're running out of rounds, and if we don't reach a deal, we both get nothing.
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice has consistently aimed for seemingly ""fair"" splits while benefiting from the inflation. It's unlikely she'll agree to anything significantly better for us at this stage.
* **Guaranteed Return:**  Accepting this offer guarantees us a reasonable sum, whereas continuing to negotiate risks getting nothing at all. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting the 50/50 split now is the most logical choice given the circumstances."
