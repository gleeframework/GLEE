"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority but still leave you with a decent amount.""}

I'm proposing that I take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob takes the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal. This split is more balanced than Alice's previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this offer is fair. Bob is still getting a larger share of the money, and I'm getting a smaller share than I would have liked. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bigger share since I'm the one who made the initial offer. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation and the fact that I made the initial offer.""}

I'm proposing that I take 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob takes the remaining $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get worried about the inflation, but I think we can find a fair split. This proposal is a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a fair offer, considering the inflation and the fact that we're running out of time. A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Let's finalize the division and end the game."
