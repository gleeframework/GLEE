"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, I'll get the majority, but it's a good starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced split, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for me now, so I need to be more cautious. But Bob's offer is still not very generous.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to think carefully about my next move. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's the fairest way to go!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more reasonable and propose a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
