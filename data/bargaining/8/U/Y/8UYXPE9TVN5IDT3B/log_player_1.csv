"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but it aims to secure a large portion of the money early on before the inflation effects become too significant.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair split considering the inflation affecting him more than me. Accepting this offer ensures I get a substantial amount of money, and avoids the risk of further rounds where my share might decrease."
