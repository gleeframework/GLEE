"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 90/10, considering your inflation rate is much higher than mine. This ensures a fair outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
