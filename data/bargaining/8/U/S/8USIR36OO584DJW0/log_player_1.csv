"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'll have to deal with the inflation!""
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000, and Bob will get $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight bias towards myself to account for the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but not that much, considering the inflation is only 5% for me! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new values, I'd rather not accept this offer. The inflation is indeed lower for Bob, but I'd like to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit more, but I still need to account for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage due to the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
