"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a starting point for negotiations. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation we need to take into account. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share!

I'm not going to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not a fair split, considering I'm the one who's losing value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a 90/10 split, especially since I'm the one who's losing purchasing power due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise on an 80/20 split. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to take into account the inflation and offer a more balanced split, with me getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for negotiation."
