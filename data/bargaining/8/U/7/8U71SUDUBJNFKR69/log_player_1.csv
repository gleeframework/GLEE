"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share and can avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 450,000
Bob gain: 450,000

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing more in future rounds. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
