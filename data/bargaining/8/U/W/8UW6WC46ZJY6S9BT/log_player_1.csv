"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount to start with, while I'll take the larger share of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, considering the initial amount is already lower due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer to counter the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a larger share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share to account for the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm starting to get desperate. I'll have to accept this one to avoid getting even less in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
