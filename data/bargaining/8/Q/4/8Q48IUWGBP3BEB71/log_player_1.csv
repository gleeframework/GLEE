I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, aiming to get a quick agreement. I'll see if Bob wants to take it or try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial proposal, even after accounting for inflation.  I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly from the first round, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Since the money is worth less now, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
