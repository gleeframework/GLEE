Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal Alice, but this is a chance for you to get something before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **The Impact of Inflation:**  While Bob is right that inflation is eating away at the value, it's hitting you much harder (20% loss per round) than him (5% loss per round). This means time is on his side, not yours. 
* **Power Shift:** By rejecting his offer, you become the proposer in the next round. This gives you a chance to steer the negotiation in a more favorable direction.
* **Aiming Higher:** Bob's offer is significantly worse than your initial proposal. Even with inflation, it's worth holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Time is money, and it's losing value fast. This is a solid offer, take it while you can.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still aiming for a larger share, Alice concedes slightly from her round 1 offer to incentivize Bob's acceptance.
* **Highlighting Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking pot due to inflation, putting pressure on Bob to accept before the deal worsens for both of them.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  The offer is framed as ""realistic"" and ""solid,"" suggesting to Bob that it's a fair compromise he should seriously consider."
