Even though the money is worth much less now, I would still rather not take nothing! There is still a small chance that I can get at least some of the money in a future round."

At this point, both Alice and Bob are losing a lot of money due to inflation. It's unlikely that Bob will accept any offer that gives Alice a larger share of the money.  This offer is a last-ditch attempt to get at least something.  It is highly likely to be rejected but it's the best shot at getting any money at all."
