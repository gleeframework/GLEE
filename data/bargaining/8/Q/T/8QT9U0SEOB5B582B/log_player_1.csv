"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets the remaining 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I would gain $100,000, which is worth 80% of the original $100,000, since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer, since I can get more value from the money if we continue to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to 2 rounds of 20% inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the remaining value of the money, while giving Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less now, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I would gain $200,000, which is worth 51.2% of the original $1,000,000, since the money is worth 48.8% less due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer, since I can get more value from the money if we stop here.
