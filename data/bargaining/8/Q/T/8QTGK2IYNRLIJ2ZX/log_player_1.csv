"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's try for a 50-50 split, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a more equitable solution."
