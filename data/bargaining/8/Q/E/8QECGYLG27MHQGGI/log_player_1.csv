Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous this round, but let's be fair and work towards a more even split in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I'm taking into account the effects of inflation on both our gains and trying to find a middle ground that we can both accept. Let's see how Bob responds!"
