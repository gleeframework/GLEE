Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, Alice. This accounts for the inflation disadvantage you face. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, my friend, let's not drag this out.  Time is literally money for me. This offer is still generous considering.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is valuable for both of us, Alice. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging your time constraint while ensuring a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is acknowledging the time pressure, his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. Accepting 450,000 now is better than nothing, but I need to hold out for a better deal a little longer.  The inflation disadvantage hurts, but it's not a complete deal-breaker yet."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're at the halfway point.  Let's be realistic. This is a good offer for both of us, and it saves us both from the risk of walking away with nothing."" 
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a larger share, but letting this drag on only hurts you. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really starting to bite now. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting ensures I at least get something substantial, whereas continuing to hold out risks getting significantly less later or even nothing at all if we fail to reach an agreement."
