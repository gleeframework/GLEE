Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."

# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. This is closer to even, and we can both get more in the next round if we're clever.

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...
