"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate further if you want. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very unfair offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but starting with a 90/10 split is a terrible starting point.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair 50/50 split.  We can adjust from there if you'd like, but I believe this is a good foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement.""
