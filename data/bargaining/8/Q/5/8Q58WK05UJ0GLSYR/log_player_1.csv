"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to get started. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, with the message that I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a more balanced offer. You can try to do better next round! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $40 * 0.9 = $36
* Bob gain: $60 * 0.9 = $54

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable as I'd like. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the middle. Your turn to improve! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $45 * 0.7279 ≈ $32.79
* Bob gain: $55 * 0.7279 ≈ $40.00

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable as I'd like. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to the middle. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
