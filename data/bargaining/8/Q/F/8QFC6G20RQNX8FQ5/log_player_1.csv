Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.  Let's seal the deal and not risk losing out due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
