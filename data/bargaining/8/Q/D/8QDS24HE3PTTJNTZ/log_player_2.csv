Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the inflation is a significant factor.  I'm proposing a 51/49 split.  This reflects the decreasing value over time, and it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
