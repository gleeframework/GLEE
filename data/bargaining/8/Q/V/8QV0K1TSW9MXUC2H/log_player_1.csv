"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  This ensures we both get a decent return, and avoids the risk of inflation eroding our gains in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
