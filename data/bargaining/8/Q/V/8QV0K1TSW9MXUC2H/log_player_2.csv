{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  This ensures we both get a decent return, and avoids the risk of inflation eroding our gains in the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'll take $55, you take $45.  This is better than what you offered last round, and waiting any longer will only hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
