"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 5% less than in the second round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreased value. Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
