Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 20% inflation for me each round, I think this is a fair offer. Let's settle on this before the value drops further for me.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant decrease in value for me, I'm trying to meet you halfway. This is as low as I'm willing to go before it stops making sense for me to continue.

# Bob gain: 5500

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and rightfully so. The value of the money is plummeting for him. While his offer is closer to a ""fair"" split, it's still in his favor in absolute terms.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll crack under the pressure of inflation in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, this is it. Take it or leave it.  The deal won't get any better for you.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm flipping the script from the previous round. This sends a strong message that I'm aware of the pressure he's under and I'm not willing to budge further. He's now in a position where accepting a slight loss is better than risking a much worse outcome in future rounds."
