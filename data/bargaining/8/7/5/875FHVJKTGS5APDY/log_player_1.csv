"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, as I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $3,200. Bob's gain of $6,000 is still the same.

I don't think a 60-40 split is fair, especially since I'm the one taking the risk of rejection. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, the total amount left is now $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8^2).

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
