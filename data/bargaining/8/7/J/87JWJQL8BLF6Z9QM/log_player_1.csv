I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's clear Bob is not going to be as generous as I was.  With the inflation, taking 60% is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
