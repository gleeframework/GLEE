"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you 40% and take 60%.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $1,000,000 and give Bob 40%. This is a fair and generous offer, considering we're just starting out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly. How about a 55/45 split? It's a better deal for you than last round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'd like to reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the value of the money I'll receive. In this case, I'd be getting $450,000, which is equivalent to 45% of the original $1,000,000.

Considering this, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with a 45% share, especially since I was initially offered 60%. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55/45 split, but with me getting the slightly larger share this time?""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is similar to Bob's previous offer, but with me getting the slightly larger share this time. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
