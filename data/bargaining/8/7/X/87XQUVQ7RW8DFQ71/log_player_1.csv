"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the money 60-40, which is a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, given that the money will depreciate with each round. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 10% less now, I'd like to negotiate further. My current offer was 60-40, but with the new proposal, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55-45 split.

I'll reject this offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 55-45 is fair, let's try 58-42""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""58-42 seems fair to me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle""
}
