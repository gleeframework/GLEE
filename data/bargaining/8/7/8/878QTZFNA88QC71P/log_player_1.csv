Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think it's important we capitalize on this opportunity. Let's make a deal where we both benefit, with me getting a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the inflation. This offer is a compromise, giving me slightly more to account for the decreasing value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. The value is decreasing rapidly, and this back-and-forth isn't benefiting either of us.  I'm proposing we split it evenly to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems generous on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation heavily impacts him.  Although he's getting $5000, its actual value to him is significantly less than in earlier rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a fair $5000, and avoids the risk of even further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
