This is a very aggressive opening move. I'm taking the lion's share, hoping Bob is willing to accept a small amount to avoid risking getting nothing in the next round due to the inflated value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although I'm getting a larger share now, the value of the money has decreased significantly. I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm taking advantage of the inflation to offer a counter-proposal that still gives Bob a significant share but keeps a larger amount for myself. This is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, and I believe it's a good balance between securing a substantial amount while still being reasonable."
