"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll think about it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $3,000, considering I was initially willing to split it evenly. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and not giving away too much."
