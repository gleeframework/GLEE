Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure I'll take the lion's share in the first round, since the money is still worth the most to me.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially considering the devaluation of the money in each round.  I don't want to risk losing everything by being too greedy!"
