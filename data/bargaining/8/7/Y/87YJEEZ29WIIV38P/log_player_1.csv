I'm going to keep rejecting Bob's offers.  Even though his offers are getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself. The inflation is getting really bad, but I'm not willing to settle for less than I think I deserve."

With inflation hitting hard, I'm realizing that we might not be able to reach an agreement on a very favorable split.  So I'm going for a 50/50 split. Hopefully, Bob will see that it's the best deal for both of us given the current circumstances."
