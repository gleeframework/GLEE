Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55/45, it's more than fair considering the inflation hits you harder. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""The inflation doesn't change the fact that a 60/40 split is fair, Bob. I'm sticking with my offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the inflation hurts me more, accepting a worse deal just because time is passing isn't a good strategy. Bob is likely to become more amenable to my offer as the rounds progress, especially since his inflation rate is lower.  I'll hold firm for now and see if he blinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This one is even more so, given the circumstances. Take it before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to use the inflation to his advantage, but his offer is getting worse for me. It's getting close to the point where I need to seriously consider his offer, but I'm still holding out for a better split. He's losing less to inflation, so he has less incentive to drag this out."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us. I'll meet you in the middle at 55/45. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a strategic concession. Holding out indefinitely isn't beneficial because the value diminishes rapidly. By offering 55/45, I'm acknowledging the inflation pressure while still securing a larger share than his previous offer. The ""final offer"" statement adds weight, hoping he understands the situation's urgency and the declining value of further negotiation."
