"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I want a bigger share for myself this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $240,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $665,000.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled with the 50-70 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50-70, I'll try to push for a more even split this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55% and you take 45%""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'm willing to give you a decent deal. This is my last reasonable offer, I think. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are biting! My gain of $450,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $216,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $850,000.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled, but I'm getting a bit desperate too. I'll accept this offer to get a decent share of the remaining money.
