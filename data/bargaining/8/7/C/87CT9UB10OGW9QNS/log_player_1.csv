Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a good chunk of the money.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'm assuming Bob has less information and might be willing to accept a deal that's slightly less favorable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the 20% inflation makes this offer seem a lot more appealing.  It's still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round."
