"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% of the original amount. Let's start with this generous offer!""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, Alice. We can both walk away with a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the new total is $950,000.

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option. I'd like to negotiate further.
