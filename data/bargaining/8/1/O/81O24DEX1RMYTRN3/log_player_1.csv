Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a majority for me this round.  Time is worth more than a small percentage, and it's only going to get worse with inflation eating at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the last round, it still favors him heavily.  I'm willing to compromise, but not at the cost of losing a substantial portion of the money.  We have plenty of time to negotiate a more equitable split before inflation erodes our potential gains further."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle.  This offer is fair to both of us, and we can avoid the risk of losing more money to inflation.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but time is still ticking and inflation is working against me.  This offer is a compromise, but it needs to reflect the urgency of the situation. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still quite a bit off from a truly fair split. We both stand to lose a lot more if we continue to allow inflation to eat away at our potential gains.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more equitable offer that reflects the value of our time and the risk of letting more money slip away."

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This is the fairest solution, and we can avoid the risk of further losses from inflation. Time is running out, and we need to reach an agreement.""}
