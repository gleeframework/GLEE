I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and giving me only $4,000 while keeping $6,000 for himself seems unfair. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

Ugh, another offer that's not to my liking! I'm getting a bit frustrated with Bob's offers. Giving me only $3,500 while keeping $6,500 for himself is still not a fair split. I'll reject this offer again and try to do better in the next round."

I'm getting really frustrated with Bob's offers! Giving me only $3,000 while keeping $7,000 for himself is not acceptable. I'm starting to think Bob is just trying to lowball me and get away with as much as possible. I'll reject this offer again and try to do better in the next round."
