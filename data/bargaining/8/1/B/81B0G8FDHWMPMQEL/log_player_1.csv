"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money, as I have the first move. I'll be interested to see if Bob accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to take a smaller share in the long run rather than accept such an unfavorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to try and reach a compromise.  Bob is clearly looking for a larger share, so I'm willing to concede a bit to avoid further rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share. I'm still hoping to get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making a significant concession to try and reach an agreement before inflation eats away at the value of the money too much. I'm hoping Bob will recognize this and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation has already eaten away a significant portion of the value of the money I'd receive. I'm still hoping for a more equitable deal, and I believe I can negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With inflation biting into the value of the money, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest solution in my view, and I hope Bob will accept it to avoid further losses."
