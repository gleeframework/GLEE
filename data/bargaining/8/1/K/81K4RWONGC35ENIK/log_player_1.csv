"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a 60-40 split, which is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to offer you a 60-40 split in my favor, since you took the lead in the first round. I'm confident we can find a fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is identical to my initial offer, but in his favor. I'm not interested in accepting this offer.
