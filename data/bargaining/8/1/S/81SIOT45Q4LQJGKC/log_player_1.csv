"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer is fair in my opinion. It leaves a good amount for me while also giving Bob a small portion. It sets a good precedent for negotiation and gives Bob some incentive to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair, but I can still do better. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a slightly higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This offer is still good for me, considering the inflation, but it is a bit lower than my first offer. I hope Bob will consider accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is making the money worth less and less, and I need to secure a portion before it's too late. While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is decent considering the circumstances."
