"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message that suggests a slightly uneven split is still fair. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This offer won't be as good next round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Given the impact of inflation, accepting $30 that's worth 20% less than in the first round doesn't seem like the best option. I'll propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nI'm taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us and proposing a slightly more even split, with a message that acknowledges the impact of inflation and seeks a compromise. Hopefully, Bob will find this acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, accepting $35, even though it's worth 48.8% less than in the first round, seems like the best option at this point. The threat of further inflation and Bob's indication that this is his final offer suggest that holding out for a better deal may not be advantageous. I'll accept this offer to secure some value rather than risking further loss."
