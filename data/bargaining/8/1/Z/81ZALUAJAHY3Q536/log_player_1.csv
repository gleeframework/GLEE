Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,

}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll aim to get a higher percentage. I'll reject Bob's offer.

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
