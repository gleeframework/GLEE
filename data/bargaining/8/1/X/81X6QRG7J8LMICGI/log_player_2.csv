"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is fair, Bob knows the money is worth less to Alice with each round.  By rejecting, Bob can potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this round.  I'm offering you a fair split, and we can end the game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob. This is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is offering more than last round, the offer is still below the initial fair split, and Bob can likely get a better deal if he continues to reject."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 620000, ""alice_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering you a little less than my last proposal, but I'm confident we can reach a deal this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer to my price, Bob. But I'm not quite there yet. 
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to the initial ""fair"" split and the inflation is hitting her hard. Accepting now secures a substantial gain for Bob."
