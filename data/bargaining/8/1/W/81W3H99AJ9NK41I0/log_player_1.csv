Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be realistic, this split accounts for the decreasing value and benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both lose with these tactics. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Let's be sensible. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

- **Time pressure:** We are now in Round 4 with 8 rounds remaining. The longer this goes on, the less money we both get.
- **Diminishing returns:**  While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, the inflation heavily impacts Bob.  Waiting for a significantly better offer from him is risky as the value diminishes rapidly. 
- **Certainty:** Accepting ensures a reasonable amount of money right now. Rejecting and continuing carries the risk of ending up with nothing."
