"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'm now considering $63 (70 - 10% of 70).

Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he's offering me $48 (60 - 20% of 60).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
