  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take this generous offer and we can call it a day.""

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. It's a good deal, don't you think, Bob?"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less each round, I'd like to get a bigger share now. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is dropping rapidly!

I'm not sure if I should take this offer. Splitting it evenly might not be the best option for me, considering the value is decreasing so quickly. I'll think about it for a moment...

Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is really dwindling now!

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. While it's a better deal than before, I'm still not getting the majority of the money. But the value is dropping so quickly, I don't know if I can do better. I'll think about it for a moment...
