Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
