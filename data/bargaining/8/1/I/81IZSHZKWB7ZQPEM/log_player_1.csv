"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, with me receiving 75% and you receiving 25%. This should be fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think 60% is a more reasonable split considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
