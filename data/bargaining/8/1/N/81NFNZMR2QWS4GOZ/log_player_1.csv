"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that we have 12 rounds to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll try to get a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You took a bigger share last round, now it's my turn to try to balance it out.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and give you a slightly smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to take the majority share, but I'll consider this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less, I'll have to weigh the trade-off.

However, this offer is still not favorable to me, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob has been trying to take a larger share. I'll aim for a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I want it to be exactly 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer considering the current state of the game. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less, I'll consider this offer carefully.

However, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, and I'm not sure if I should take the risk of going to the next round. But, since it's a 50/50 split, I'll accept this offer.
