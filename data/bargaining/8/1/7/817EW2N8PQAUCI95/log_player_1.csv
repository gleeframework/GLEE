Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference. I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer heavily favors Bob, even more so with inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such a skewed starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too low for me. Let's meet somewhere in the middle this time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's getting risky to keep going back and forth. We need to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth, especially for you. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal at the start, with inflation it's becoming increasingly reasonable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal carries the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. A 50/50 split guarantees a decent amount right now."
