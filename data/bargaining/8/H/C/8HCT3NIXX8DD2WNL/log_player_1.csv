"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'll consider the offer. Since I'll be gaining $300,000, which is worth 95% of the original $600,000, and Bob will be gaining $700,000, which is worth 70% of the original $1,000,000, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
