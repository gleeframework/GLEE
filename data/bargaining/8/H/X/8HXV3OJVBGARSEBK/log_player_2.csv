"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, I think I can do better.  I'll need to see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think it's fair, considering the inflation disadvantage you'll face in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer.  While I'd prefer more, the money is losing value quickly and it's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing."
