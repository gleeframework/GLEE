"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will affect us both in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want a better deal than just 10%.  Let's see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a 60/40 split.  It's a more even distribution, and we can always adjust later if we both feel it's necessary.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move towards a more even split, but I still need to account for the inflation that affects me more than you.  Let's try a 70/30 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with a 70/30 split.  I think we can negotiate something fairer.  Let's see what happens next round."
