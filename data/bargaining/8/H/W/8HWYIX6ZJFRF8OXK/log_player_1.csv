"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'm effectively gaining 54 (60 x 0.9).

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is 50 or 52.5 (50 x 0.95), but I'll assume it's 50 for now.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.
