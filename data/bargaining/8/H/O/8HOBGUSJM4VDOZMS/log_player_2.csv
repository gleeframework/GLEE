Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both. Let's end this with a fair 50/50 split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being kind with 57-43! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation is heavily impacting Bob's potential gains. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse outcome.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While 430,000 is significantly less than the initial offer, it's unlikely Alice will offer a better deal.  She knows Bob is feeling the pressure of the inflation.

It's a tough choice, but taking the sure thing now prevents further losses for Bob."
