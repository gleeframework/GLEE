# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. Not a bad deal, but I can do better.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 3

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than 40% of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
