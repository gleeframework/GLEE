Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this settled.  Your offer was tempting, but still favors you too heavily considering the faster inflation hitting my end.  I propose $55 for me, $45 for you. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
