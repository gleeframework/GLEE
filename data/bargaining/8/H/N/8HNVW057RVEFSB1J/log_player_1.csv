Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your starting offer wasn't bad considering the inflation, but it heavily favored you. I propose a more balanced split that accounts for the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
