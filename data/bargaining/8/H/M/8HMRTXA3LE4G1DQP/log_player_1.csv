Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take $9,000 for myself and give $1,000 to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not happy about getting only $1,000, the inflation means that if I reject this offer, I'll be getting even less in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
