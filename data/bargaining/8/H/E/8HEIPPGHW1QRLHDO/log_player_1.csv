"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30 to get started. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started!"
