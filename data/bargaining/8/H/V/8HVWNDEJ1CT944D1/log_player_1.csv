I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a more significant share, considering the initial offer I made was already quite generous. I'd like to negotiate further."

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's closer to my initial proposal in Round 1. The difference between 75% and 68% isn't too significant, and I'm willing to compromise to end the game."
