"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it seems tempting to get something, the 90/10 split is still very unfair. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. I'll try to leverage the inflation effect to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my offer again, but still keep it relatively fair.  I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise a bit. Inflation is working in my favor, so I'm hoping he'll be more open to a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Inflation is hurting him more than me, so I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  I think I can get a more even split if I keep pushing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping it above 50/50.  I'm hoping Bob is starting to feel the pressure of inflation and will be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Inflation is really hitting Bob hard now, and I'm hoping he'll come around to a more even split soon. I'm not going to settle for a 30/70 split when I know I can likely get more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer before inflation makes it even less appealing for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  He's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm not giving up yet.  I think I can still get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm finally offering a 50/50 split. Inflation is hurting both of us now, and I think we need to be realistic.  It's time to compromise before we both lose everything."
