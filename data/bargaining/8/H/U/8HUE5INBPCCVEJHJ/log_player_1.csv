"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch things up, I'll take 60 this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

I don't like the fact that Bob is trying to take the majority of the money, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer this time.
