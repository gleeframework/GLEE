"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 and leave Bob with 100,000. It's a generous offer, considering I could have taken it all!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's tempting to try and get more, with inflation I know that the money I receive is worth less every round.  I'll accept this offer and at least take home 100,000."
