"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal. This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's a good starting point to ensure we both benefit before inflation takes its toll."" 
}
``` 
 
Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Early Advantage:**  While not perfectly fair, a 60/40 split in Alice's favor takes advantage of the fact that the money devalues faster for Bob. 
* **Incentivize Acceptance:** Bob loses money at a faster rate (10% per round) than Alice (5% per round).  This offer gives him a substantial sum upfront, making it more appealing than risking a worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed as a starting point, implying Alice is willing to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more even split is fair, considering the inflation that will impact us both. Let's work together to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's message sounds conciliatory, his offer is actually worse for Alice than his initial rejection. Here's why:

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob is using the inflation argument to his advantage. He knows the money devalues faster for him, yet he's proposing a split where he gets more than Alice. 
* **Future Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she's not easily swayed and understands the impact of inflation. This puts her in a stronger position for future negotiations.  Bob is losing value more rapidly, making him more likely to make a better offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be strategic. I understand you want a fair share, but time is literally money in this game - especially for you. This offer is a win-win if we accept now."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice is conceding slightly from her initial 60/40 offer, making it appear more reasonable to Bob. However, she's still securing a larger portion of the money.
* **Emphasize Time Pressure:** By highlighting that Bob's losses increase faster due to inflation, Alice is creating urgency for him to accept the deal.
* **Win-Win Framing:** The message positions the offer as mutually beneficial, even though Alice still gains more. This can encourage Bob to accept rather than risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
