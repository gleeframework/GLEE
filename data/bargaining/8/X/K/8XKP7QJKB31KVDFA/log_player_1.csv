Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a more even split, and we can both get more money now instead of risking losing it with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
