"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round. Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping to do better than 68% of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the remaining value, which is a bit more aggressive considering the inflation."
