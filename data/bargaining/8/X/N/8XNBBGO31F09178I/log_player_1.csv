"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We both get half, no inflation, no risk. It's a win-win. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer sounds fair on the surface, I'm losing potential gains by accepting. Here's why:

* **Inflation is in my favor:**  Bob's money is losing value every round, while mine is not. This means his incentive to make a deal should increase over time.
* **I have time on my side:** We have 12 rounds. Rushing to a 50/50 split early doesn't leverage the advantage I gain from inflation working against him.

I'll counter-propose in the next round, aiming for a higher share while still leaving Bob with a reasonable amount that's more appealing than risking further inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 850000,
""bob_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still on the table. Consider that accepting now gives you a guaranteed amount, while further delay means risking a smaller share due to inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** I'm maintaining a strong stance while acknowledging Bob's desire for a ""fair"" deal by slightly increasing his potential gain. 
* **Highlighting Inflation:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure and the diminishing value of Bob's potential share.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is still heavily in my favor, it leaves space for further negotiation if Bob remains resistant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer gives you a bigger share, and I'll still get a substantial amount.  Let's avoid further inflation and reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, as evidenced by his more significant move towards a 60/40 split. However, I need to remain strategic. Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Inflation is working in my favor:**  While 400,000 is still a considerable amount for Bob, the value will continue to decrease with each passing round. His position is weakening, while mine remains strong.
* **Time advantage:**  We still have eight rounds left.  There's no need to rush into an agreement that doesn't fully leverage the advantage inflation gives me.

**Strategy for the next round:**

I will propose an offer with a smaller increase for Bob (around 65/35 split).  This keeps the pressure on him while acknowledging his willingness to compromise. My goal is to secure a deal where I gain at least 70% before we run out of rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  This offer reflects that. However, time is running out, and with it, the value of the deal is decreasing. Let's be reasonable and secure a win-win before it's too late.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm offering Bob a small increase from my previous proposal, signaling my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time Pressure:** I'm reiterating the urgency of the situation, reminding Bob about the shrinking value of his potential share.
* **Aiming for a Favorable Deal:** I'm still aiming for a 70/30 split, but this offer allows room for a potential compromise if needed. My goal is to secure a deal where I receive a significant majority before the remaining rounds dwindle down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still willing to negotiate. This offer gives you a larger share while still ensuring I get a fair amount.  We're both losing money with every passing round. Let's work together and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally met my target split! While I could potentially push for a slightly higher gain in subsequent rounds, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. Here's why:

* **Meeting My Goal:** This offer secures my desired 70/30 split, achieving a significant majority of the initial $1,000,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While Bob's share is decreasing due to inflation, there's no guarantee he will offer a better deal in future rounds. He might become more resistant to concessions, leading to a stalemate and a scenario where we both get nothing.
* **Time Factor:** We're past the halfway point of the rounds. Accepting now eliminates the risk of running out of time and losing the entire amount.

This deal represents a successful negotiation, leveraging inflation to my advantage and securing a favorable outcome."
