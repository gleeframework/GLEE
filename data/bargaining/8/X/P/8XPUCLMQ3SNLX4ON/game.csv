600000.0,400000.0,Let's divide it fairly. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. It's better to accept now before inflation kicks in!,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be fair, I think a 50/50 split is the best way to go.  This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our earnings.",Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 58% and you can have 42%. It's still a fair deal, and we should settle before the money loses more value.",Alice,3,

560000.0,440000.0,Inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. I'm willing to compromise further. Let's settle on 56% for me and 44% for you. It's time to make a deal before the money becomes worthless!,Alice,5,
