"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Fair is fair, indeed!

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a 50-50 split, and I'm not getting any younger (or wealthier) by waiting for the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
