Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging from my position, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. Don't expect me to give up more than this. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is not ideal, it's important to consider the declining value of the money.  Accepting it now is better than risking further losses due to inflation."
