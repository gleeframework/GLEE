"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose that I take $90 and Bob takes $10. This is a fair starting point, but I believe I'll need to offer more in future rounds to avoid losing the money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is better than the initial one,  I am willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in future rounds. The inflation affecting Bob means he has a greater incentive to come to an agreement. I will aim to secure a larger share of the money in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $80 for me and $20 for Bob. This is still a significant gain for me, but it's a gesture of goodwill towards finding a compromise. I believe this offer is fair given the pressure of inflation and that Bob will be the one to propose next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to really hit Bob's potential earnings. This offer is a fair compromise, and given the shrinking value of the money, I'm not confident I can secure a better deal in future rounds."
