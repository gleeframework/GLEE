Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected the offer, I'll try to be more aggressive. Here's my offer for Round 2:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 19% less now, I need to adjust my valuation accordingly. In real terms, Alice's offer is equivalent to:

* Bob gain: 20 / 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = 24.69
* Alice gain: 80 / 0.81 = 98.76

This offer is still quite favorable to Alice. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer for Round 4:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
