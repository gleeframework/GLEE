I propose taking 990,000 dollars and giving Bob 10,000 dollars. This is a very advantageous offer for me, and I believe Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000} 
```

I'm going to take a slightly smaller share this time, offering Bob 50,000. While this is still heavily in my favor, it's a significant increase for Bob compared to his previous offer, and with each passing round the value of his share will decrease. This might be enough to incentivize him to accept, especially considering the risk of getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob's share is decreasing with each round, so he might start taking bigger risks, potentially leading to me getting nothing. This offer is a fair compromise, securing a decent amount while minimizing the risk of ending up empty-handed."
