Alice's offer:

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I think a 65/35 split is fair, considering the inflation will impact us both in the next round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll offer 58% for me and 42% for you. It's a better deal for you than before. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious concern. Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount, and the risk of getting nothing is too high."
