While this is a generous offer, it's too early to accept. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll try to balance our gains. Will you accept this compromise? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is trying to get a better deal by exploiting the inflation. While I would accept this offer earlier, the money I gain is worth significantly less now due to inflation. I will see if I can get a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
