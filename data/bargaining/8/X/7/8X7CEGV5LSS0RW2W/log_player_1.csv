"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a pretty good deal for both of us, considering we have 11 more rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split, reflecting the potential for increased gains later in the game. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* I would gain $400,000, which is worth 40% of the original $1,000,000, considering the 10% inflation.
* Bob would gain $600,000, which is worth 60% of the original $1,000,000, considering the 20% inflation.

Considering the potential for increased gains later in the game, I'll think carefully...

I'll reject the offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to balance our gains. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is worth 30% of the original $1,000,000, considering the 20% inflation. I'll keep $700,000 for myself, which is worth 70% of the original $1,000,000, considering the 10% inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more equitable solution. We both need to be happy with the outcome to ensure we both get something.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a little more fairness in the split. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll analyze Bob's new offer:

* I would gain $600,000, which is worth 60% of the original $1,000,000, considering the 27.1% inflation.
* Bob would gain $400,000, which is worth 40% of the original $1,000,000, considering the 48.8% inflation.

Considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting closer to the deadline, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'll accept it.
