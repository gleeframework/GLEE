"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This way I get most of the money, but Bob still gets something. Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is much worse for me than my original proposal. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'll offer Bob $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself. Since the money is worth less to me with each round, I'll need to give Bob more to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm getting less and less with each round, Bob's offer is still too low. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I need to give Bob more, but I'm still trying to secure a decent share. This time, I'll offer him $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting significantly less than I initially hoped for, I'm aware that the situation is becoming increasingly dire. The money is losing value rapidly, and there's a real chance we both end up with nothing if we keep rejecting offers. I'll accept this offer to secure at least some portion of the money."
