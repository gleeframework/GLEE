Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. 55/45 seems fair to me, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation. It's clear Bob is aiming for a larger share, and continuing to reject his offers might lead to us getting even less in the later rounds."
