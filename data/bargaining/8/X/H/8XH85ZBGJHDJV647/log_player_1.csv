Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very simple offer - 990,000 for me and 10,000 for Bob. This is a very high share for me, but since we have so many rounds left, I hope Bob sees the potential for a better deal later on if he rejects this. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm accepting this offer. Inflation is a real threat, and it's getting worse with every round.  500,000 is a substantial amount, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
