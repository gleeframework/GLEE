"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my target gain is now lower.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

Round 3
