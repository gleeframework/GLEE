"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively generous starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $450,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as I was hoping for a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting a worse deal. I'll accept this offer.
