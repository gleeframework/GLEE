"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but it's still reasonable and leaves a good amount for Bob. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
