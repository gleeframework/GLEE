This is a standard strategy in ultimatum games.  Since I am the first to propose, I offer Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll take it to avoid getting nothing at all in later rounds. I know the money is worth less with each round, so I want to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it might seem tempting to take $1, remember that the money is worth less each round. By rejecting, I can propose a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly.  I'm still aiming for the majority of the money, but I want to make it more enticing for him to accept.  He knows the money is worth less with each round, and I'm hoping this offer will be enough to make him see that rejecting it could mean getting nothing at all in the next round."
