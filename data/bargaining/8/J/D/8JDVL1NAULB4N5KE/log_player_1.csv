Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  I figure it's a good starting point, giving Bob a decent amount while still securing the majority for myself. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 927272.73 
# Bob gain: 72727.27 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
