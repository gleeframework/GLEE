"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000, and I'll take the rest. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can try to do better if you want, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 10% less than the initial $4000, which is $3600.

My gain is still $6000.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it's a good starting point.
