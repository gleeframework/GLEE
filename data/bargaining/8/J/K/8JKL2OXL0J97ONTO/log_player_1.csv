"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is being ""generous"", I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'll give you 420000 instead""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
