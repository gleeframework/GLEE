"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm willing to concede some of my gains to try and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer represents a significant amount of money, and considering the rapidly increasing inflation, I believe it's in my best interest to accept."
