"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are changing quickly.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me less than I initially offered him, I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting.

I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I want to try to get a better deal, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not being too greedy, considering the inflation."
