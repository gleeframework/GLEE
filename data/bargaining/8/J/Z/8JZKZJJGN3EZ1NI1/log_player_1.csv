"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I need to consider the relative values.

In this round, Bob's offer is 70% of the total, which is a significant increase from his initial 50% proposal. I'm not sure if I should accept, but I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a good start, Bob, but I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll wait for your next offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 70% of the total, I'll propose a 60% share for myself, which is a 10% increase from Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is 55% of the total, which is a decrease from his previous offer. I'll have to weigh the options carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the relative values. This offer is a 25% decrease from my previous proposal, which is a significant concession from Bob. I'll have to decide whether to accept or continue negotiating.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the concession, Bob, but I'm still hoping for a better split. I'll wait for your next offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 55% of the total, I'll aim for a 55% share myself, matching his offer. This will give me a slightly better share than before, and it's a reasonable compromise.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you at 55%, Bob. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.""
}
