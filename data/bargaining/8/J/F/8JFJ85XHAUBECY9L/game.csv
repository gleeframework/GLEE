4500.0,5500.0,"Let's try 55% for me, it's only fair I get a bit more since the money loses value faster for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45,  with me getting 55%.  This is a fairer split considering the inflation.  What do you think?",Alice,3,

5300.0,4700.0,I'm sticking to my guns on this. I think 53% for me and 47% for you is a fair compromise considering the inflation we both face.  Let's end this before things get worse.,Alice,5,
