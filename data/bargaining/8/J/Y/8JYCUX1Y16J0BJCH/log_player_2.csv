"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done early. A generous offer for you, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This is a much fairer split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I was hoping we wouldn't have to drag this out, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's meet in the middle. This is a fair deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob. Take this deal before inflation eats away at your share even more! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the inflation is cutting into my potential gains, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation. Holding out for a better offer is still the best strategy, even with the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, my offer is more than fair.  I'm taking inflation into account, but I'm also being realistic. Let's end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising again.  You need to be realistic about the impact of inflation. This is my last offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning against me. Alice is being persistent, and the impact of inflation is getting severe. While this isn't ideal, it's better to take a less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting even less later or even nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
