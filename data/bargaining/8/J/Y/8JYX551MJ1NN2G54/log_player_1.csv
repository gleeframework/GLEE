"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the risk of inflation.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering that my proposal in the first round was already a 50/50 split. I'm not willing to accept a worse deal just because of a perceived risk of inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob is willing to accept a 60/40 split, I'll try to get closer to a 50/50 split by offering a slightly better deal for myself.

```
