"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll take a slightly bigger share""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm trying to be generous, but I'm also trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.

After calculating the new values, I realize that I'll actually be getting $3,200 (20% less than the initial $4,000) and Bob will be getting $6,000 (10% less than the initial $6,700).

Considering the reduced values, I think Bob's offer is still reasonable, so I'll accept it.
