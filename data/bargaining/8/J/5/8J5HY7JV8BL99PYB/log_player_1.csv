"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and simple."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! 

I'll think for a moment... 

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the 45$. It's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going into another round with the money being worth even less."
