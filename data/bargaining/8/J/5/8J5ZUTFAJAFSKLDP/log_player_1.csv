"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent share for you 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You took a big chunk last round, now it's my turn to take a bit more!""
}
```

Let's see how Bob reacts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep the majority 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! My gain is worth less and less each round. I'll think carefully about this offer...

Considering the decreasing value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's see if I made the right call!"
