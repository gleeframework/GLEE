"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. You get a good start, but I get the lion's share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept being given only 100,000 out of a million dollars, especially when I know I can negotiate better terms in the future. Let's see what Alice has to offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly this time. I'm willing to give you a good portion, but I need more than 100,000. We have a lot of rounds left, so let's find a deal that works for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 450,000. This is a fair split considering the inflation affecting us both. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, I'm still not comfortable with a 400,000/600,000 split, especially with the inflation impacting my share.  I believe we can find a better agreement that's more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split this down the middle. This is the fairest solution, considering the inflation affecting us both. We can finalize this and get the most out of our share before the money loses more value.""
