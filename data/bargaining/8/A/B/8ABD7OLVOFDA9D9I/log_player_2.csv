"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I think it's a good way to begin. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to take a chance and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less with each passing round, I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise to avoid losing value.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think I can do a bit better than 50/50. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?""}\n\nLet's see if Alice will accept this slightly more favorable offer for me. I'm still being relatively generous, but also trying to take advantage of the fact that the money will be worth less in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little, but I think 52/48 is a fair split considering the inflation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, I'm more motivated to try and get a better deal, even if it means risking further inflation. I think Alice might be willing to compromise more in future rounds, so I'll take that chance.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 58 for me and 42 for you? It's still a relatively fair split, but I'm trying to make up for the lost value.""}\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts to this offer. I'm trying to balance being reasonable with taking advantage of the situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is getting serious, Bob. We need to compromise. Let's go back to a 50/50 split to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant loss in value due to inflation (59.04% less than the first round), I believe accepting the 50/50 split now is the most reasonable decision. Further rounds will only continue to devalue the money, and the risk of ending up with nothing after the 12th round is too great. Alice's offer to return to a fair split is a good compromise under the circumstances, ensuring we both receive some value."
