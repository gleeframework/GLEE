Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle due to the higher inflation you face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's important to see if I can get a better deal. Since my money is depreciating faster, I need to maximize my gains early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe a more balanced split is fair considering our different inflation rates. Let's start with this offer and see where we go from there.""}

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is more favorable than her previous one, my money is depreciating quickly.  I need to continue pushing for a more balanced split in order to maximize my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice,  we need to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to 5500, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our respective inflation rates. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and I'm demonstrating flexibility. This offer is a fair compromise that acknowledges the time pressure we both face. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I still need to push for a more balanced split. With each round, my money is losing value significantly, so I need to secure a larger share to offset that loss."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're facing time pressure, but I need a better deal to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise by offering you 4800. Let's find a solution that benefits us both before the inflation takes its toll.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the time constraint and the inflation we both face. Let's end this negotiation and secure our shares. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my money is depreciating rapidly, accepting a 50/50 split in this round is the most sensible option. Further negotiation risks losing any money at all.  It's time to secure what I can."
