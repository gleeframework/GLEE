"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle due to the higher inflation you face.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe a more balanced split is fair considering our different inflation rates. Let's start with this offer and see where we go from there. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is tempting since it's more than I'd get if I reject and propose the same split in the next round. However, he's clearly aiming to take advantage of his faster inflation rate. 

Let's take a risk and see if he's bluffing.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we need to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to 5500, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our respective inflation rates. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but he's still trying to take the lion's share.  While the deal is getting better, it's still skewed in his favor given the inflation rates. I need to hold firm a little longer.

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're facing time pressure, but I need a better deal to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise by offering you 4800. Let's find a solution that benefits us both before the inflation takes its toll. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting really tight. Bob is finally acknowledging the time pressure, and his offer now is barely less than what I proposed last round.  

However, accepting now means settling for less than my initial offer in round one. Let's push our luck a little further, but I need to be ready to concede next round if he doesn't budge significantly.
