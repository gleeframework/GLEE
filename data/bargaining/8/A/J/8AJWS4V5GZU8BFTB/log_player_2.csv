Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a better share. I'm offering 600,000 for myself, and 400,000 for you.  Let's find a solution before we lose even more money.

# Alice gain: 600000

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical decision for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting a decent offer now outweighs the risk of getting a slightly better deal later when the value has decreased further.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by increasing her offer to Bob. It's unlikely she'll drastically reduce her share in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer (like the 70/30 split Bob proposed) is risky. Alice could get frustrated and offer even less in subsequent rounds. 

Accepting 400,000 now guarantees Bob a reasonable sum, even after accounting for the inflation that has already occurred.
