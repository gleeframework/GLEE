"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not happy with a 10% share. Let's be a little more equitable.  I propose we split it 60/40 in my favor.  This gives you a better share than you started with, and it allows us to move on.   
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
