I propose that I take 900,000 dollars and Bob takes 100,000 dollars. This is a good starting point, and allows for room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  Given the inflation, and that we're both likely to keep rejecting each other's offers, this seems like the fairest and most likely way to reach an agreement."
