I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I was hoping for a slightly better deal, and I'm not convinced that a 45-55 split is fair. I'd like to make a new proposal in the next round."

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split. It's not ideal, but it's a fair deal considering the rounds we've gone through. I'm willing to end the game here and take the $5,000."
