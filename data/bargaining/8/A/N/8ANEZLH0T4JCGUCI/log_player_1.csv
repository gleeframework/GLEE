Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. We're losing money with each round.  This offer ensures we both get a good amount before inflation erodes our gains further. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, which is good for Alice.  While he's focused on the immediate loss from inflation, Alice recognizes that Bob's offers are getting worse for him. Holding out longer puts Alice in a stronger position to demand a larger share in the later rounds."
