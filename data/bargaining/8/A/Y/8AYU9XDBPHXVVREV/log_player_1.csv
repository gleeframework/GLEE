"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's aim for a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's try 55-45, a bit more in my favor but still a fair split""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, where I get a slightly larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a decent deal."
