While this seems like a fair offer at first, considering the inflation rates, it's definitely worth seeing if Alice will budge. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest way to divide it, considering the inflation rates.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a bit better than her previous one, but still not ideal. I'm still hoping to get a larger share, and I think I can push for it. The inflation rate is hurting Alice more than me, so she might be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""We need to be realistic here, Alice.  The inflation is hitting us both hard, but you're losing out more. This split is fair, considering the circumstances.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is slowly getting closer to what I'm hoping for. However, the inflation is impacting her much more now, and I think I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to keep pushing for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is taking its toll on both of us, but especially you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us before it's too late. I'm willing to compromise, but this offer is as far as I can go.""}
