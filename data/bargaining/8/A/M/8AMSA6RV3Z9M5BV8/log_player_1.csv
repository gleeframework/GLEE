"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still fair enough to potentially be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
``` 
Let's try a 50/50 split.  With inflation, Bob's last offer wasn't very generous, and this should be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less now, accepting this offer means I get something rather than nothing in the next round."
