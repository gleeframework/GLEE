"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd rather get more money in the current round to compensate for the loss. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, the money I gain is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% in the first round and another 20% in the second round). I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

This way, I'll get 45% of the remaining amount, and Bob will get 55%."
