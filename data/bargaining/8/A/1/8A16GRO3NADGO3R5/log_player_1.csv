# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is less generous than mine in the first round, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential risks of waiting for a better offer.

After considering the numbers, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You took 60% in the last round, I'll take 42% this time. Don't expect more.""

```
