"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% of the money, leaving you with 40%. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take 60% of the $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the value of my gain is now 540,000$.

I'm not thrilled about giving up such a large share, but Bob's offer is a significant compromise. Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject this offer.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, the value of my gain is now 486,000$.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair and equal share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less, the value of my gain is now 363,000$.

I'm not thrilled about giving up a significant share, but Bob's offer is a compromise. Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject this offer.

However, I'm starting to feel a bit desperate, and the value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
