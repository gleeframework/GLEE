"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a more even split is in order. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation is hurting you:** Every round you wait, the value of the money decreases for you. Bob isn't affected by inflation, so he's happy to wait.
* **Bob's offer is worse:**  He's offering you even less than your initial offer, which was already generous considering the inflation factor.

You need to act strategically. Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that you're serious about getting a fair deal and are willing to risk letting time pass."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for me in this situation. I'm offering a slightly better deal for you, but we need to wrap this up soon.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** This offer gives Bob a bit more than his previous offer, but significantly less than what Alice originally proposed. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure to encourage Bob to accept a deal rather than dragging things out. 
* **Finding a balance:** Alice needs to balance getting a decent share with the fact that her position weakens with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the time pressure, but I need a fair deal. This offer gives us both a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is taking advantage of the situation. He knows the value of the money is decreasing for you, and he's trying to push you into a corner. This offer is even worse than his previous one, effectively giving you less than half of the initial amount after inflation. 

It's a high-risk, high-reward move. You need to show Bob you're serious about not accepting a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now. Any more delays and we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and firm:**  No more negotiating room. This message makes it clear that Alice is serious about ending the game soon.
* **Even split:** By offering a 50/50 split, Alice removes any argument of unfairness. It highlights that Bob is losing potential gains by dragging this out.
* **Final warning:** The message implies this is Alice's final offer. If Bob rejects this, he's risking a much worse outcome in the later rounds. 

At this point, it's a battle of nerves. Alice needs to show Bob that she's willing to walk away if she doesn't get a reasonable deal."
