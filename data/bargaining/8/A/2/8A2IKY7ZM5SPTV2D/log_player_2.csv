Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for me in this situation. I'm offering a slightly better deal for you, but we need to wrap this up soon. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now. Any more delays and we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is the point where accepting becomes the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very real. 
* **Diminishing Returns for Alice:** Alice is experiencing significant inflation. Her potential gains are decreasing rapidly, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on.
* **50/50 is Fair:** While Bob might have aimed for a higher share initially, a 50/50 split ensures he gets a substantial amount and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
