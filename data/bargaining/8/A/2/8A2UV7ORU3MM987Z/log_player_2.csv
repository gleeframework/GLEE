I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the bigger share. What do you say?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55/45 split? It's a fairer deal than before, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the 450,000. It's a decent gain, and with inflation, I don't want to risk getting nothing."
