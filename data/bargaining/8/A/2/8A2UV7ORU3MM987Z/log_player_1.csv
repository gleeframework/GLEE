"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 300k. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the bigger share. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a 60/40 split, but I'm also not eager to go to round 3. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is getting worse, and my potential earnings are decreasing rapidly!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55/45 split? It's a fairer deal than before, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 5% decrease in value due to inflation. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Your turn, Bob!"
