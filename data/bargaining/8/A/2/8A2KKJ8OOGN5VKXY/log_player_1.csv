"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a simple and straightforward proposal, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount now to avoid wasting time. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than before, I'm looking for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I think I can do better than 30% of the total amount.

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share than before, but I'm still holding onto a decent chunk of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, and I need a bigger share to make this worth my while. Meet me at this price or I'll walk away. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the decreasing value of the money, but I'm also not willing to give up too much. Bob's offer is getting closer to what I was initially looking for, but I'm still not comfortable with the 60/40 split.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I think I can get a better deal than this.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting a bit frustrated with the decreasing value of the money and Bob's increasing demands. I'm not thrilled about the 65/35 split, but I'm also not willing to walk away completely.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it. I hope Bob will be more reasonable in the next round.
