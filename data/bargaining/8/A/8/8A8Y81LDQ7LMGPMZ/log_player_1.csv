Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm holding firm on this.  You're focusing too much on the initial numbers and not the significant losses we both face if this fails.  We need to agree soon. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

``` 
At this point, accepting is the best course of action.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point of the rounds. The longer this drags on, the worse the deal gets for both of us, but especially for me due to inflation.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Bob's offer isn't ideal, continuing to push for a higher amount is increasingly risky.  Each rejection significantly devalues the potential winnings.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob is signaling firmness. There's a real chance he won't budge much further, especially if he's confident I'll cave in due to the time pressure.

Taking the 5200 is better than risking a complete loss if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
