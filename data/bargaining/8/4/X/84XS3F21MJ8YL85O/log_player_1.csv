"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can see how the game unfolds."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one. Consider it a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the reduced value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,

}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split it 50/50 and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in the value of money, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. It's better than accepting a smaller share, and it ends the game.
