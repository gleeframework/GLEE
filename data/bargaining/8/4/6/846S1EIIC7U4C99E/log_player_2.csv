Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my first offer and your counteroffer. This is a good compromise.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than last time, but I'm not going below 57%. The pressure is on you, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting slightly better, Alice is using the time pressure and inflation against me. It's better to hold out a little longer and aim for a more equitable split, even with the inflation losses."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob. I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not budging much. You're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**The Situation:**

* **Time Pressure:** Only 5 rounds left, meaning Alice has 2 more offers after this.
* **Inflation:** The longer I wait, the less valuable the money becomes.  A 440,000 offer now is significantly less appealing than in Round 1.
* **Alice's Strategy:** She seems content to chip away tiny amounts, knowing time is on her side.

**Decision:**

While far from ideal, the risk of getting even less in later rounds is too high. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting now cuts my losses. Alice is playing a ruthless game, and waiting any longer might result in an even worse outcome. It's a gamble, but accepting ensures I at least get something."
