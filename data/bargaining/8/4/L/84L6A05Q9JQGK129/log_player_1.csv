"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling a little greedy. Let's go with 60/40, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too one-sided. I'll think about it, but I'm not ready to accept yet.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer and see if I can get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher gain to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot!""
}
```"
