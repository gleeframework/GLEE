"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has mirrored my original offer. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a slightly better deal to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a 55-45 split to account for the inflation.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly better split to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
