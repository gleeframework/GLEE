"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going for a high share, but I'm not being greedy. I'm giving Bob a chance to get something. I'll see if he wants to accept or risk a lower offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much lower than my initial offer, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. Even though I have to consider the inflation, I'm going to hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than his last offer. I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept, as the inflation will continue to affect his potential gains if we go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, and the inflation is really starting to hurt.  I know that he has the power to make the final decision, but I am still going to hold out for a better deal. I'm not sure if he is aware of how much the inflation has affected the value of the money, but I'm hoping he'll come to his senses in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than his last offer, hoping he realizes that we're both losing out with each passing round due to inflation. If he rejects this, he risks losing more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, this is the best offer I've received so far.  I don't want to risk losing even more by continuing to reject offers. It's time to accept and end this game."
