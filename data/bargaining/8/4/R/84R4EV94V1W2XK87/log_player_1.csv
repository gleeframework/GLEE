"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money 60-40. If you reject, I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000."
