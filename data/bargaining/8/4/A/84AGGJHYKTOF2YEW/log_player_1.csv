"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money for myself in the first round. This is a risky strategy, as Bob could reject and then take a larger share in the next round. However, it gives me a head start and sets a precedent that I am aiming for a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  

* **Inflation:** The money is worth less now, and my share will continue to decrease with each round.
* **Potential Loss:** Rejecting this offer means I risk getting nothing in the end.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob's offer is a clear indication that he's aiming for a bigger share, and the inflation will likely work in his favor in the future rounds. 

It's better to secure a reasonable share now than gamble and potentially lose everything."
