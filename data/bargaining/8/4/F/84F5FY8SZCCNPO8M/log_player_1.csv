"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can do better in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 30%. This is a relatively fair split, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You didn't take advantage of the lowball, now it's my turn to make a strong offer! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial hesitation!

Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in Round 2 is worth 20% less than in Round 1, so the effective value of the $50 I gain in Round 2 is $40 (80% of $50).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a strong one, considering the value of the money has decreased. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so the effective value of the money is 64% of the original value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the effective value of the money, leaving Bob with 45%. I'm hoping this compromise will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up on getting more, you're leaving too much on the table! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money.

Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in Round 4 is worth 51.2% of the original value (100% - 48.8%). So, the effective value of the $40 I gain in Round 4 is $20.48 (51.2% of $40).

Bob's offer is a significant increase from his previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 48.8% less than in Round 2, so the effective value of the money is 51.2% of the original value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get something in return. Let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 30% of the effective value of the money, leaving Bob with 70%. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable compromise for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not settling for 30, I want a bigger share, you're getting too greedy! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my willingness to compromise.

Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in Round 6 is worth 32.77% of the original value (100% - 67.23%). So, the effective value of the $20 I gain in Round 6 is $6.55 (32.77% of $20).

I'm not sure if this offer is the best I can get, but I'm getting desperate. I'll accept this offer to avoid a worse deal in the next round.
