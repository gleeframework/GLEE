I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still leaves a decent amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, as I don't want to risk losing too much money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation is starting to bite.  It's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting even less in the next round."
