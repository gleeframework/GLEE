I'm going to start with a slightly unfair proposal. I want to keep the majority of the money, but I'm offering Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer than my previous one, and I don't know how much money Bob has left due to the inflation. It's better to take the guaranteed 50% now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
