"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can both be happy with this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the reminder about the inflation!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet halfway just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, Alice. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000

```
{

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:
