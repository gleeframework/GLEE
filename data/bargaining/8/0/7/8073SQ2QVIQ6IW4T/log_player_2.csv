Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand inflation is a factor.  But a 65/35 split is too lopsided.  Let's compromise at 70/30. This still gives you a good share, and it's fairer for both of us in the long run.

Round 5
