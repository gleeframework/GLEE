"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to keep more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential gains.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'd rather not take a deal that gives me less than 50% of the total.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to protect my own interests""
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains now!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
