"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still value $7,000 as $7,000, but for Bob, the $3,000 is worth 20% less than in the first round, which is $2,400.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather get the extra $600.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This time, I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money for both of us.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still value $5,000 as $5,000.

For Bob, the $5,000 is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. In the first round, $5,000 was worth $5,000 for Bob. So, $5,000 for Bob in the first round is worth $5,000 / (1 - 0.208) = $6,250. Now, $5,000 is worth 48.8% less, which is $6,250 * (1 - 0.488) = $3,225.

I'll accept this offer because I'd rather get $5,000 than $3,225.
