"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a small amount.  This is a starting point to see how Bob will react and whether he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
``` 

This offer is still favorable to Alice, but it increases Bob's share slightly. I'm hoping this demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still retaining a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is still unfavorable to Alice, even with the reduced value of money due to inflation.  Alice is still in a strong position to negotiate for a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This offer further reduces Alice's share, but it still gives her a significant amount while offering a more substantial share to Bob. This is a further attempt to compromise while still maintaining a favorable position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the inflation is significantly impacting Bob's share of the money, this offer is still not favorable to Alice. She's still in a good position to negotiate for a larger share, and the risk of running out of rounds is still low."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer again reduces Alice's share, but it further increases Bob's, demonstrating a continued effort to compromise.  It also positions Alice to potentially make a final offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While inflation is significantly affecting Bob's share, Alice's position is still strong.  There are still enough rounds left to make a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With the inflation rate accelerating, it's time to consider a more equal split. This offer proposes a 50/50 division. The risk of losing everything is now more substantial, and a compromise is necessary to avoid that outcome."
