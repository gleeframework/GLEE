"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering the money will be worth less in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think a 60-40 split is fair, especially considering the money is worth less in the future. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share now, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's make it happen!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer before the money becomes even less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We'll both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth significantly less with each passing round, an even split seems like a reasonable option. It's better to get a guaranteed 50% of the remaining value rather than risking further losses.
