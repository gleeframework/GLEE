"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the money is getting less valuable by the round. My initial reaction is that I'd like to get a bit more, but Bob's offer is a fair one.
