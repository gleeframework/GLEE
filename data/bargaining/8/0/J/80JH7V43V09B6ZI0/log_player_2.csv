"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more to account for inflation, but we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something now, the offer is too lopsided in Alice's favor. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way we both get a fair share and avoid any further inflation losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's find a middle ground.  This accounts for inflation but still gives you a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the safest bet.  Alice's offer is still better than the previous round's, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal if we continue. The risk of losing more money due to inflation is too high."
