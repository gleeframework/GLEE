Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way we both get a fair share and avoid any further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting, especially since the value of the money is going down for me. However, I need to consider if I can do better if I hold out a bit longer.
