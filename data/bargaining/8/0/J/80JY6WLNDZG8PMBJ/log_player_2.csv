"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. I believe this is fair given the potential inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is not terrible, I'm going to reject it. There's a lot of money at stake, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm also concerned about the inflation and want to see if I can leverage that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
