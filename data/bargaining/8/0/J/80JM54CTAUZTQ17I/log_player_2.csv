Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This offer is still heavily in your favor, and the clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this generous offer before the inflation eats away at your share too! 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the offer than risk losing more money in the next round. The inflation is hitting Alice harder, so it's possible she'll make a worse offer in the next round, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal."
