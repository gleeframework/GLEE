"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair split, but I'll take a slight edge. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

Since the amounts are equal, I'll accept this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
