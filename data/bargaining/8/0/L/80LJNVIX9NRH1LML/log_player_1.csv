"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. This seems like a reasonable starting point, allowing for some negotiation while still ensuring I get a large share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. The inflation penalty is significant, and it's likely Bob will continue to demand a larger share in future rounds.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, even with the inflation discount."
