"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I propose to keep $900,000 for myself and give Bob $100,000. This way, I secure a large portion of the money, and Bob still gets something. Since it's the first round, there's no inflation yet, so this offer is quite advantageous for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I propose to keep $600,000 for myself and give Bob $400,000.  This is a more balanced split, and while it's less than my initial offer, I'm still getting a significant portion of the money.  With inflation taking effect, I need to be more flexible to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my initial proposal, and the inflation is making it worse. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm proposing an even split of $500,000 each.  With inflation steadily increasing, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers. I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is simply too low, even with the significant inflation.  I'll reject and hope for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000} 
```

I propose to keep $400,000 for myself and give Bob $600,000. I'm offering him a larger share in hopes of securing a deal. The inflation is getting serious, and I need to be more flexible to avoid ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting increasingly unfair, and the inflation is taking a serious toll. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

I'm proposing to keep $300,000 for myself and give Bob $700,000.  The inflation is getting out of control, and I'm willing to give Bob a significant share to secure a deal. I need to avoid getting nothing at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is incredibly low, even with the significant inflation. While I am running out of time, I will reject this offer in hopes of a better deal in the next round. The risk of getting nothing is real, but I need to try to hold out for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000}
```

With only two rounds left, the inflation is pushing me towards a desperate situation. I'm offering Bob $800,000 and keeping $200,000 for myself. This is a significant concession, but I need to secure a deal to avoid getting nothing. I hope Bob will see the urgency and accept this offer."
