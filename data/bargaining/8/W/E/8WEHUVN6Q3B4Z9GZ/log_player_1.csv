"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $50 (worth $55 in the first round)
* Bob gain: $50 (worth $55 in the first round)

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept Bob's proposal.
