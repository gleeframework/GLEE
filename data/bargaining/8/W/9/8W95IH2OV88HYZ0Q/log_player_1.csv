"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 60%, I'll try for 80% this time. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money I gain, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
