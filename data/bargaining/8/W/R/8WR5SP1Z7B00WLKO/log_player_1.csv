"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division, but I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50-50 split is a fair proposal, especially since it's a meeting point. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, considering the initial offer I made was 60-40.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I need to be more aggressive with my offer to account for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 500, hoping to get a better deal, but still keeping it relatively close to the 50-50 split that Bob proposed in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much. This is my best offer so far! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! In the fourth round, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I need to be very careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I think he's trying to make a good deal, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best possible outcome. The 4800-5200 split is still not as favorable to me as I would like, especially considering the initial 60-40 split I proposed.

However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
