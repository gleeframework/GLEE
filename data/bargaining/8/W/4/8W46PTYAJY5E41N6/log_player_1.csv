"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in Round 2, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 1, so I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting out of control!

Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in Round 1, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to Round 5.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
