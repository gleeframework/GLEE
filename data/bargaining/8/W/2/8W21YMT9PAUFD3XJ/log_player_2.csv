"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives me a slight advantage to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Here it is:
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, Bob, but the clock is ticking and that money is losing value - for you! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the decreasing value of the money for me, I believe I can still get a better deal. Alice's offer is not significantly better than her initial one, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to negotiate a more favorable split. The pressure of the game's time limit and the effect of inflation on my potential gain might work in my favor if I can make Alice believe I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the money's decreasing value for me, I'll make an offer that's slightly more aggressive, while still trying to appear reasonable. Here it is:
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is ticking for both of us, Alice. Let's be realistic about the money's value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it.  The money is quickly becoming worthless to you! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant decrease in value for me and Alice's statement that this is her final offer, I believe it's time to accept. The risk of proceeding further and getting nothing due to the time limit or Alice's unwillingness to negotiate further outweighs the potential benefits of holding out for a slightly better deal. At this point, securing 3500, despite its decreased value, seems like the most pragmatic decision."
