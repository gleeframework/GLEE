Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away more of your share. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
