I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation will affect Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $1,900 and keeping $8,100 for myself. While the inflation is affecting me more, I want to keep a larger share, but I also want to ensure we come to an agreement before the money becomes completely worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $2,710 and keeping $7,290 for myself.  Despite the inflation, I'm still aiming for a larger share. We're getting close to the end, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
