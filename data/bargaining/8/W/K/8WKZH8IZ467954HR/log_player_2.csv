"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous.  Take the 10k and call it a day.  Otherwise, the money will shrink with each round. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. $10,000 is not a fair share of $1,000,000. There are 12 rounds, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need the majority of the money.  Let's not waste any more time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make up for the inflation.  Let's reach a fair agreement before we lose too much. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still too low. I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share this time, but I need to secure a majority of the money to make this worth my while.  Let's make a deal before we lose more to inflation.""}
