Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that inflation hurts you more than me.  It makes sense to settle this quickly.

# Bob gain: 650000
