I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage I face in later rounds."

I offer an 80/20 split, giving me $800,000 and Bob $200,000. While the inflation is taking its toll, I'm still willing to share a significant portion of the money to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
