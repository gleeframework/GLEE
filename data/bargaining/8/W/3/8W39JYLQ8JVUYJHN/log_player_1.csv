That's a terrible offer! I'm not going to accept a deal where I get significantly less than Bob, especially knowing the value of the money decreases for me with each round. Let's see what I can propose in the next round."

This is incredibly frustrating! Bob is consistently mirroring my offers but with the advantage of the inflation working in his favor. I need to drastically change my approach if I want to secure a reasonable amount."

This is agonizing! Bob is sticking to his pattern, and time is running out.  I need to make a bold move in the next round or risk getting a pittance."

It pains me to accept this, but with the time pressure and inflation working against me, this is the best I'm likely to get.  Any further attempts to negotiate could result in a worse outcome."
