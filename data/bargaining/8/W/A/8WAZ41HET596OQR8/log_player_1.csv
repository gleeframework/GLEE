Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice. My patience is wearing thin. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more money, the inflation is eating away at my gains, and Bob is getting increasingly demanding. It's better to take the offer and get something than risk getting nothing."
