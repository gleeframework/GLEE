"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer, I'm hoping we can agree on this. It's a fair split considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  This time I get the larger share, but it's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away more of your potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but this is my final offer.  We're both losing money with each round, and this is the fairest way to split it while still accounting for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Reasoning: 

While I'd prefer my 70/30 split, Alice is likely to be even tougher in future rounds as the inflation heavily impacts her. Taking 600,000 is a guarantee and a reasonable compromise at this stage. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later.
