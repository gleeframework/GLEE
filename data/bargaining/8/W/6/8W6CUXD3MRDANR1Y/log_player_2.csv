"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after one round, it's now worth $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, it's now worth $6,400 (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.64).

My calculation for Alice's offer is:
Bob gain: 3500, Alice gain: 6500
Bob's share is 3500 / 10,000 = 0.35, which is 35% of the original amount, and since the money is worth 64% of the original amount, Bob's gain in the original amount is 0.35 * 10000 / 0.64 = 5468.75
Alice's share is 6500 / 10,000 = 0.65, which is 65% of the original amount, and since the money is worth 64% of the original amount, Alice's gain in the original amount is 0.65 * 10000 / 0.64 = 1015.625

Since Alice's gain is 65% of the original amount, but the money is worth 64% of the original amount, I will adjust my calculation to account for the inflation:
Alice's gain in the original amount is 6500 / 0.64 = 1015.625, which is actually the gain in the new amount, so this offer is actually better for Alice than it seems.

My decision:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 72% of the original amount after three rounds (0.8 * 0.64), it's now worth $7,200 (10,000 * 0.72).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3750 
# Alice gain: 6250 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 59.04% less than in the first round, it's now worth $4,096 (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.64 * 0.7204).

My calculation for Alice's offer is:
Bob gain: 3750, Alice gain: 6250
Bob's share is 3750 / 10,000 = 0.375, which is 37.5% of the original amount, and since the money is worth 40.96% of the original amount, Bob's gain in the original amount is 0.375 * 10000 / 0.4096 = 914.0625

Since Alice's gain is 62.5% of the original amount, but the money is worth 40.96% of the original amount, I will adjust my calculation to account for the inflation:
Alice's gain in the original amount is 6250 / 0.4096 = 1525, which is actually the gain in the new amount, so this offer is actually better for Alice than it seems.

My decision:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 79.04% of the original amount after five rounds (0.8 * 0.64 * 0.7204), it's now worth $7,904 (10,000 * 0.7904).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}"
