I'm going to try to be fair, but also maximize my share. I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a small amount, but it's better than nothing if he rejects the offer and we risk both getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's important to remember that the money is losing value with each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me $1,000, which is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
