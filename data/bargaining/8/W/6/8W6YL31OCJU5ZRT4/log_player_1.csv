This is getting too greedy on Bob's part.  While the value is decreasing, I need to hold out for a better offer."

This is a tough one! While not ideal, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the time pressure is significant.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round, the value decreases drastically. Waiting might land me with even less in the end.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems unlikely to budge much further, and risking a worse offer with each passing round isn't in my best interest.

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me something, which is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
