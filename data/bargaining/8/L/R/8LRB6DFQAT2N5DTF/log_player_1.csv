"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, this offer is actually more favorable to me than the original 50/50 split. I'll accept this offer.
