"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion of the money, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. I'm not sure how he'll react to inflation, but I'm hoping he'll be more focused on getting something rather than trying to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, this offer is much better than what I would get if I reject and risk getting nothing in the next round."
