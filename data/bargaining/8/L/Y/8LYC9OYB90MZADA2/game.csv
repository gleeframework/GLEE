45.0,55.0,"I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation hits you harder",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,

42.0,58.0,"I'll take a bit more, since the inflation is in my favor and you're losing more value each round",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's just split it evenly.  We're both losing value with each round, so I think a 50/50 split is the most sensible way to end this.",Alice,5,
