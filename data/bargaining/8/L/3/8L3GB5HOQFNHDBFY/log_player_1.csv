  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'm not thrilled about giving up 100,000$, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll have to consider the opportunity cost of waiting.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but still wants a slightly larger share. Since I rejected his previous offer, I'm not sure if I should give in now.

However, considering the inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less. I'll have to think about whether I should prioritize getting a better deal or settling for a decent offer.

Considering the inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less. However, I'm not sure if I should push for a better deal or settle for a decent offer.
