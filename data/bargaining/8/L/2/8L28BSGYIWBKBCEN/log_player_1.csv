{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you'll still have to make a sacrifice 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and giving me only $4,000 while keeping $6,000 for himself is not acceptable. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
