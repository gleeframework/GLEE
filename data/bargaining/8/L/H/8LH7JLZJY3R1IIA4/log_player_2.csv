"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, literally!  This offer is still good for you, but let's not wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie.  This is my final offer. Take it, and we both walk away with something.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is still generous considering the inflation. Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the value of continuing to negotiate is heavily outweighed by the impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings. 

* **Shrinking Pie:**  The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's share is actually worth due to the 20% inflation per round. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has presented the same offer twice and called it her final offer. This suggests she's unlikely to budge, and Bob risks walking away with even less if he rejects this and loses in a later round.

**While not ideal, accepting a 40/60 split is better than risking a worse outcome in a later round where the value of his share is further diminished.**"
