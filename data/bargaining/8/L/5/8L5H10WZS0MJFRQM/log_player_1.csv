"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer from Bob.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not sure I want to give up a 10% share, but Bob's offer is still a decent one. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer for myself.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the remaining $100, which is $75, and Bob gets 25%, which is $25."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is eating away at the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm thinking...

If I accept this offer, I'll get $80, which is a significant amount, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the remaining 20%. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer now that I've rejected Bob's previous proposal.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 85% of the remaining $100, which is $85, and Bob gets 15%, which is $15. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob!"

# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm thinking...

If I accept this offer, I'll get $90, which is a huge amount, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the remaining 10%. I'll decide to...
