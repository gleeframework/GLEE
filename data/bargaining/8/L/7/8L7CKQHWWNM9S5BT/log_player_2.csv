"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but I'll give you a decent starting point.  Accept this and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous in the first round, it's crucial to consider the inflation factor. Accepting this offer means missing out on potentially getting more in the next round, especially as the value of the money decreases for Bob with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile given the inflation. Let's split it 55/45.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40. This is a fair share for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial amount of money for Bob, even with the inflation.  It's a compromise that's reasonable, considering the risk of getting nothing if we continue."
