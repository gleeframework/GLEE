"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000. I'm being generous and straightforward in my offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in future rounds.
