"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to start with a relatively generous offer to see if we can reach a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split. Accept and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I need to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite fair enough. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially with the reduced value of money. I'll wait for a more favorable offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. No need to haggle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and avoid further negotiations."
