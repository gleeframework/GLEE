Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the bigger share this round, but I'm open to negotiating a fairer split in the future if you accept.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While a 10$ gain is better than nothing,  I'm not going to be taken advantage of so early in the game. I'll make a counter-offer next round."
