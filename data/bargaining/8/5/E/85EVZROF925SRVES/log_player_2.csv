Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that last offer was insulting. I'm being serious now, take it or leave it.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is ridiculous. Accept this deal now, or we both risk ending up with nothing! This isn't a game, I'm serious! 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting more impatient (and her potential gains are decreasing), it's still too early to accept such a low offer. We're only in round 5, and I'm banking on the fact that Alice would rather take a smaller amount than nothing at all as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your frustration, but I'm serious about finding a fair deal. This offer acknowledges the inflation impact and still leaves you with a substantial sum. Let's be reasonable and settle this.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  You're being incredibly shortsighted.  Don't let greed make us both losers! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly getting desperate, but this offer is still unacceptable.  She's trying to scare me into accepting a low offer by emphasizing the approaching deadline. However, I'm betting she'll be even more willing to compromise in the next couple of rounds to avoid getting nothing."
