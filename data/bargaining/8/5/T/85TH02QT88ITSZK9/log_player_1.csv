"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to get something rather than nothing. My message is a friendly one, trying to appeal to his sense of fairness. Now it's up to Bob to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. In this round, my gain of $7,000 is worth 5% less than the $8,000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $7,400. This offer is still a bit more generous than that, so I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better split in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I'll have to be even more cautious. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to be reasonable and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a 50/50 split!

In Round 4, the money is worth significantly less due to inflation. My gain of $5,000 is worth 14.26% less than the $8,000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $6,857. This offer is actually a better deal for me than my previous offer, and it's a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm hoping we can finally settle on a deal!"
