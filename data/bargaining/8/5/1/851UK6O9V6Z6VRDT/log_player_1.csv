"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to get this done quickly.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  Let's see how he feels about that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a pretty bad deal for me, considering the inflation! I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm going to try and get a little more than last time, but I need to account for the inflation.  I'll offer Bob $1900 and keep $8100 for myself.  Hopefully, he'll see it's a better deal than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1900 
# Bob gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty bad for me, considering the inflation has now eaten away a significant portion of my potential earnings.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm going to try a more aggressive approach this time.  I'm going to offer Bob $2710 and keep $7290 for myself.  This is the most I can reasonably offer while still considering the inflation and aiming for a decent share of the money."
