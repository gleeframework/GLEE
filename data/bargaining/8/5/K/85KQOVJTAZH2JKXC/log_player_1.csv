"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 200,000 is now worth 160,000. It's a pretty low offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll accept this offer.

```
