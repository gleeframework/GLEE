{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 6000 and leaving 4000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's end this now and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering that I'm losing more value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both 5000 each, to try to find a compromise that works for both of us."
