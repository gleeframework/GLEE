"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose to keep 90 dollars for myself and give Bob 10 dollars.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation means my share is worth less, and if I reject this, Bob gets to propose next round.  Given the inflation rate on my side, it's likely his offer would be even worse in the next round."
