"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively fair split, and hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation effect. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather get a bit more, so I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a slight improvement from his previous offer, and hoping he'll accept this time."
