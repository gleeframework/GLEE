"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\nI'll offer a fair division to start, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. Given that the money loses value faster for me than for Bob, I'll aim for a division that slightly favors me but remains reasonable for Bob to consider, especially since the value decreases more significantly on my end with each round. I'll propose a division that gives me 55% and Bob 45%, hoping the slight imbalance will encourage acceptance before further devaluation affects us both more severely.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering your higher inflation rate. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\n\nConsidering the offer and the impact of inflation, I must weigh the pros and cons. The money is worth 20% less for me now, which means the $450,000 offered is actually worth $360,000 in original value. For Bob, the money is only worth 5% less, making his $550,000 worth $522,500 in original value. Given this significant drop in value for me and the relatively minor drop for Bob, accepting this offer now might be more beneficial than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.
