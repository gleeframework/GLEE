"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get the better deal for myself, since I'm the one making the first offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than before, so I need to be careful.

After considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit better than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was slightly better than mine in Round 1.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself, which is a 50-50 split. I'm framing it as a compromise, but I'm actually trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
