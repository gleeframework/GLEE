Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is now worth 20% less, the 50 dollars I'd get in this round is actually equivalent to 40 dollars in the first round (50 * 0.8 = 40).\n\nConsidering this, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
