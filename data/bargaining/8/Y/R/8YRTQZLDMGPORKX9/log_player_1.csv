"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose that I take $9,000, and Bob gets $1,000.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
``` 

I'm going to try and get a better deal than Bob's offer in the last round.  I'll offer him $1,500 and keep $8,500 for myself. While the inflation is a factor, I think I can still get a good deal here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'm not happy with this outcome, I'm better off accepting Bob's offer than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing in the next round."
