Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. 10 dollars is not a good deal, and I'm confident I can get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a more equitable split, with me receiving 60 dollars and Alice receiving 40."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While it's better than the first round, I'm still not satisfied with the split. I believe I can get a more favorable deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable division, considering the impact of inflation on both of our shares."
