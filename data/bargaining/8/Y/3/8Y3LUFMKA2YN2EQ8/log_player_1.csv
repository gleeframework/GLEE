"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 10% less again. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm trying to balance the risk of waiting for a better offer with the need to get a decent share of the remaining money."
