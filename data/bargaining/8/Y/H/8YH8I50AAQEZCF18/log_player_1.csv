Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided deal in my favor. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm going to assume he's as susceptible to it as I am.  I want to maximize my gains in this first round, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. It's a much fairer deal than the one I proposed, and the inflation isn't high enough to justify risking getting nothing at all."
