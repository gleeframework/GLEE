75.0,25.0,I propose dividing the $100 with a 75:25 split. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I propose a 60:40 split in my favor. While the money is losing value, I believe this is a fair compromise for the risk of declining your offer in the previous round. Let's work towards a solution.",Bob,2,
