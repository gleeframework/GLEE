"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe I can negotiate for a better split. Since the money's value decreases by 20% for Alice with each passing round but remains the same for me, I have an advantage in prolonging the negotiations. I aim to capitalize on this advantage to secure a more favorable division of the money. Let's proceed to the next round where I'll make a proposal that better suits my interests."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the depreciation of money for you, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make an offer that takes into account the depreciation of money for Alice but still leans in my favor. Given that the money loses 20% of its value for Alice with each round, she might be inclined to accept this offer to minimize her losses. The message aims to subtly remind her of the consequences of prolonging the negotiations, hopefully prompting her to accept my proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair given the inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice frames her offer as a ""fair"" 50/50 split, I must consider the effects of inflation on her gains. Since her money is now worth 36% less than in the first round, her proposed split doesn't equate to equal value for both of us. Given that my gains are not affected by inflation, I can afford to continue negotiating for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and aim to capitalize on the asymmetry caused by inflation to secure a more advantageous split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Given the significant depreciation of money for you, this split is more reflective of the current value.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've made an offer that more aggressively takes into account the depreciation of money for Alice. With her money now worth 36% less than initially, I believe she may be more inclined to accept a deal that, on the surface, seems less favorable but actually reflects the adjusted value due to inflation. My message aims to reinforce this perspective, suggesting that this split is fair given the current circumstances."
