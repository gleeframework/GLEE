Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising here. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While this offer is better than her previous one, it's still in her favor.  Bob can likely leverage her increasing desperation in the next round to secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. This offer is a slight improvement for me, and it's the best you'll get at this stage. Let's wrap this up.""}

**Reasoning:**

- **Time Pressure:**  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely. Delay plays to Bob's advantage.
- **Slight Edge:**  This offer is slightly better for Bob than Alice's previous offer, but still within the realm of a potentially acceptable compromise for Alice given the circumstances. 
- **Urgency:** The message conveys urgency and implies this is Bob's best offer, pushing Alice towards acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

- **Final Offer:** Alice's language suggests she's nearing her breaking point.  
- **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, Bob's position won't improve drastically, even with Alice's higher inflation rate. 
- **Acceptable Outcome:** While not ideal, this offer is still better than what Bob might have accepted in earlier rounds. It avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
