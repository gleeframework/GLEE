"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice. No more, no less. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 4800
* Bob's gain: 4000

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to meet halfway, I'll try to take a slightly higher share this time. With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation. Can we try this?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. Don't push your luck. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive! With inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less, so the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 2600
* Bob's gain: 6000

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even lower effective gain...
