Bob is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation on his gains. While a 50/50 split sounds fair, I'm still in a much stronger position to negotiate a better deal."

Bob is really stuck on a 50/50 split, even though it's becoming increasingly worse for him with each round. It's time to push my advantage a little further since he seems hesitant to move from this position."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end. I'm still confident that a fair split is the best way to maximize our gains.  Let's not let this inflation completely wipe out our potential.  Let's agree on 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's getting too risky now. While I could hold out for more, Bob seems dead-set on a 50/50 split.  If I reject this, there's a good chance we'll end up with nothing, and something is better than nothing."
