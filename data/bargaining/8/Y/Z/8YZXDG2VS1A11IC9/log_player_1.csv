"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This way I get the majority of the money, but I still leave something for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 855000, ""bob_gain"": 145000}
```

I propose that I get $855,000 and Bob gets $145,000.  I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further rounds of inflation, especially since Bob has shown he's willing to be aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 145000 
# Bob gain: 855000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to take a bigger chunk this round.  The inflation is getting pretty serious, and I need to secure a larger share to make it worthwhile.  $750,000 is still a significant amount, and I'm hoping Bob sees that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the inflation eats away at his share even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me. Accepting this offer at least secures some money for me. It's better than risking getting nothing at all in future rounds."
