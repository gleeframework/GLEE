"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm taking a 70-30 split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
