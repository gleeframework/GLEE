Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, but I want to secure a large share of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much lower than my previous proposal, and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll take my chances in the next round and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the first round, but still aiming for a significant share. Bob will be feeling the pressure of inflation, so I think this is a fair offer."
