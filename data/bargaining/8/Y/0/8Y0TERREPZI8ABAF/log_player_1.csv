"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation disadvantage you'll face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but considering the inflation disadvantage I'll face in the next round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After some thought, I've decided to...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the $4,500 and hope that I can do better in future rounds."
