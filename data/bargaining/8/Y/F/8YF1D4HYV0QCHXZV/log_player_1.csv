"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. This seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 20$ is actually worth 16$ (80% of 20%). I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's better than going to the next round. I'll accept the offer.
