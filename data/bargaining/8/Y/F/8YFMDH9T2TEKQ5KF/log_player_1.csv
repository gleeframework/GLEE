Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 90-10 in my favor. It's a fair deal considering your offer last round.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
