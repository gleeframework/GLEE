"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now looking at a 40% share, which is worth 80$ in the previous round's value. Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, but now it's worth 60$ and 40$ respectively.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain even more, I need to be even more cautious. However, I'm not sure if I should accept or reject this offer. Considering the previous rejections, I'm starting to think that Bob might be trying to squeeze me out.

Let me calculate the effective values of the offer in the first round's value... If I accept this offer, I'd get 55$ in the first round's value, which is a decent amount. But I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

After some consideration, I'll accept Bob's offer.
