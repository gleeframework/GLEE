"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my potential gain of $50 is now worth $47.50.

Considering Bob's offer, I think 60/40 is a bit too skewed in his favor, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but 55/45 is my minimum.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With another 5% inflation, my potential gain of $47.50 is now worth $45.13.

Considering the previous offers, I'm going to propose a slightly more aggressive split to account for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm firm on 55/45, but willing to negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 58/42 is a better compromise. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on our potential gains!

With the 14.26% inflation, my potential gain of $45.13 is now worth $38.81.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 58/42 split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about 58/42, can we try 53/47?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With another 5% inflation, my potential gain of $38.81 is now worth $36.86.

Considering the previous offers, I'm going to propose a slightly more aggressive split to account for the continued decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll try 52/48. That's my final offer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
