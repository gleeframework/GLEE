"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100 and give Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd rather take more, but I don't want to give Bob too much. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the increased inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll ask for more. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
