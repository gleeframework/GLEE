"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the actual amount I would gain is 900,000 * 0.9 = 810,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain 500,000, which is less than what I would gain in this round if I were to continue.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I would gain is 900,000 * (1 - 0.271) = 636,900.

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain 450,000, which is less than what I would gain in this round if I were to continue.
