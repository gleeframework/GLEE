"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  I'm sure we can find a more equitable split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob.  I'm being more than fair, but this deal won't last forever. 
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is money.  Let's split this fairly, before we both lose out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  Take it or leave it, but time is literally money for me. 
# Bob gain: 271000 
# Alice gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While it's not ideal, taking this offer is the best option. The inflation is making Alice's gains decrease significantly, while mine remain the same. If I keep rejecting and it gets to the point where Alice gets less than $0, she might just walk away, resulting in me getting nothing."
