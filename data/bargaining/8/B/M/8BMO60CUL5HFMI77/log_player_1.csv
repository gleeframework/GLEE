Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the proposal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking the majority this time, but I'm open to negotiating a more even split in the future. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'd rather take the risk of making a counteroffer in the next round than accept a less favorable split. Let's see how the game unfolds!

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more conservative offer, considering the inflation. I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor.
