"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. Time is money! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 10% inflation rate for me is a concern, but I think I can get more than 35% of the original amount.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division.\n\n###\n\nMy proposal: 420000 for me, 580000 for Alice.\n\n###\n\nReasoning: I'm taking into account the inflation rates for both of us. Since Alice's inflation rate is higher, I'm willing to give her a slightly larger share to account for the decreased value of the money in the next round. However, I still want to get a significant portion of the original amount.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this proposal to Alice.\n\n###\n\n(Note: Please respond with Alice's decision, and I'll proceed accordingly.)\n\n###\n\nEdit: I realized I made a mistake in my response format. Here is the corrected response:\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nMy proposal: 420000 for me, 580000 for Alice.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this proposal to Alice.\n\n###\n\n(I hope this is in the correct format now!)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a fair offer. Let's make a deal!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this proposal to Alice.\n\n###\n\nI'm looking forward to her response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this takes, the less we both get. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer in Round 3. Although the money is worth 19% less for me than in the first round, I believe this offer is reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n###\n\nAlice's message mentions that this is her final offer, which suggests that she may not be willing to compromise further. Given the circumstances, I think accepting this offer is the best decision to ensure I receive a significant portion of the original amount.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've accepted her offer, and we can conclude the game.\n\n###\n\nThanks for playing the game with me! If you want to play again, feel free to start a new round."
