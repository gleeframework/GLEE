"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start with. Let's see how this goes! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 100,000 is a decent sum, it's worth trying to get more.  With 12 rounds, there's room to negotiate and potentially get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer. This way, we both get a good starting point and we can see how the game unfolds.""}
