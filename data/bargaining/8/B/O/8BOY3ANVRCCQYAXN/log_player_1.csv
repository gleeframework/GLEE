Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

 I propose to keep 90$ for myself, and give 10$ to Bob.  This way, I get the majority share, but Bob still gets something to incentivize him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I propose a more balanced split this time. Since the money is losing value, I'm willing to accept a smaller share. This way, we both get a decent amount, and there's a good chance Bob will accept it."
