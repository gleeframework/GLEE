Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it.  A 50/50 split is the only fair offer at this point. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I'd like a better share, the effects of inflation are getting severe. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking a worse offer or getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
