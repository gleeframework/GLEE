"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you half, but I think I deserve more for being the one making the offer this round 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. But I don't want to be too greedy, or Bob might reject again.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
