"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $600,000 and Bob can have $400,000. It's a generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first move. Let's see if Bob is reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we both face. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Although the money is worth less now due to inflation, Bob's offer doesn't seem fair to me. I think I deserve a larger share, considering I made a more generous offer in the first round. Let's see what happens in the next round!###"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous again. Don't be greedy!""}\n\nI'll take $580,000 and Bob can have $420,000. Given that the money is worth less now, I'm still making a relatively generous offer. I hope Bob realizes that it's better to settle now rather than risk losing more value in the next rounds. Let's see if he's smart enough to accept this offer!###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to 600k, but we need to move quickly.  The longer we wait, the less we'll both get! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Although Bob is trying to create a sense of urgency, his offer is still not fair in my opinion. Given the significant decrease in value for me, I think I deserve a better split. I'll hold out for a more favorable offer or try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. The game is far from over!###"

This is a fair deal!""}\n\nI'll take $550,000 and Bob can have $450,000. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle. This offer is more than reasonable, and I hope Bob will see the sense in accepting it. We're running out of time, and it's better for both of us to settle now!###"
