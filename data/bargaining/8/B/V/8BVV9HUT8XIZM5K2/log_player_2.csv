Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more evenly this time. My turn to get a slightly better share.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again. Still willing to share fairly 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is fair and we both lose if we drag this out.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. Still not good enough for me 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold my ground a little longer. Accepting 43 now would be a significant loss compared to what I could have had initially.  There's still a chance she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the risk of getting nothing increases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a majority share, take it before we both end up with nothing!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to start getting more aggressive with the offers, as Alice clearly doesn't value fairness as much as maximizing her gain. Offering her 52% is still better than nothing in later rounds, and the message conveys a sense of urgency.  It's a gamble, but the clock is ticking."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging. You're the one losing value, not me 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with each round, the potential gains for me shrink drastically. Accepting 44 now is better than risking getting a slightly better share in later rounds, only to have it be worth significantly less due to inflation. Alice is clearly playing hardball, and I need to cut my losses before the situation gets any worse."
