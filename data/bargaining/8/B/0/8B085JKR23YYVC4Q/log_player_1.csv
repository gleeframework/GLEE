"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no need to get greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. I think I can do better. I'll pass on this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect too much""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to make a slightly better offer than Bob's previous one, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight advantage, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to run out of time and the money is worth less and less, so I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer. I'll take the 45% and hope that Bob will be satisfied with the outcome."
