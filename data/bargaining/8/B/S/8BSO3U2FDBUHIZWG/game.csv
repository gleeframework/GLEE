525000.0,475000.0,"I understand the pressure, but given the difference in how the money's value decreases for us, I think this split is more reasonable. It's a bit higher than my last offer, but I'm trying to account for the faster depreciation on my end. Let's settle this before it's too late.",Bob,4,
