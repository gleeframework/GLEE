"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering the value of money decreases with each round. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 55-45 split, as I was hoping for a slightly better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about 52-48? Let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive split in my favor, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
