"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, let's end it here 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation effect on my gain. However, Bob's proposal is a 50/50 split, which is a fair one. I'll take the offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
