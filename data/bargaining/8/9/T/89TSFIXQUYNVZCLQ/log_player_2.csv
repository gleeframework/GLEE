Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but letting this drag on only hurts you more. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
