"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable and split it 60-40. It's a good deal for both of us.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a decent amount, and I'm taking $600,000 for myself. I hope Bob will see the reason in this proposal and accept it. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your 60/40 split seems unfair to me, let's meet in the middle. I propose a 52.5/47.5 division. This way I get slightly more, but you are still getting a significant portion. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I see you're willing to negotiate, but 52.5/47.5 is still not good enough for me. How about we meet closer to my original offer? 58/42 is a good compromise.""
}
```

I'm still trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Hopefully, Bob will see the reason in this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. It's round 4 and we're both losing money due to inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. Don't be greedy, let's both walk away with a good chunk of money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
