600000.0,400000.0,Let's be reasonable and split it 60-40. It's a good deal for both of us.,Alice,1,

475000.0,525000.0,"Your 60/40 split seems unfair to me, let's meet in the middle. I propose a 52.5/47.5 division. This way I get slightly more, but you are still getting a significant portion.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"I see you're willing to negotiate, but 52.5/47.5 is still not good enough for me. How about we meet closer to my original offer? 58/42 is a good compromise.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's be real. It's round 4 and we're both losing money due to inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. Don't be greedy, let's both walk away with a good chunk of money.",Bob,4,
