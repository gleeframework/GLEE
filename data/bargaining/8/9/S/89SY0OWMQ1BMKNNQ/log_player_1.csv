"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a third.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game just started. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less now, my gain of 40 is actually $36.

I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a bit more skewed towards him, but I'm still getting a decent amount. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, my gain of 40 is actually worth $32.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm now offering an equal split, hoping Bob will accept it."
