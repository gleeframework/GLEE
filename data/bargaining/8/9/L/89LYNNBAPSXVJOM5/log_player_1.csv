Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm going to start with a high offer for myself, but leave a small amount for Bob to hopefully encourage him to accept it in the first round. This way, I avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my potential gains in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is offering me a much smaller share than I offered him in the first round.  While I'm aware of the inflation, it's still too early to accept such a drastic reduction. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still keeping a larger share.  I hope this will be enough to convince Bob to accept before the inflation further reduces my potential gains."
