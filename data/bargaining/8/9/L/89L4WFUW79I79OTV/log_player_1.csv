Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively unfair deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to accept a 50/50 split than to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
