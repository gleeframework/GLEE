"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you'll still have to make a concession 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 95% of 5000, which is 4750. And Bob's gain of 6000 is actually worth 80% of 5000, which is 4000.

I'm not sure I'm ready to concede 2000, so I'll reject this offer.

```
