"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split the money evenly, but I'm willing to offer you a slight advantage to start.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting since it's more than I'd get if I reject and we fail to reach a deal. However, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. Let's gamble a bit and hope he's willing to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
