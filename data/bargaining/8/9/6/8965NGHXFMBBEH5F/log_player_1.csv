"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced division""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the game."

# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is a good one. I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to give up too much. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I think I should get a slightly larger share to account for the decreased value. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

Round 3

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. The money is worth even less now, and I think I should get a bigger share to account for the decreased value. 45/55 is not a good ratio for me, especially since I was willing to give Bob a slightly smaller share in my previous offer. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

I'm extremely unhappy with Bob's offer. The money is worth a significant amount less than in the first round, and I think I should get a much larger share to account for the decreased value. 40/60 is a terrible ratio for me, and I don't think it's fair considering the circumstances.
