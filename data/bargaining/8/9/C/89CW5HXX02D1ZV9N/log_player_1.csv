After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the effects of inflation are really starting to bite! With my gain worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate.

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept the 40-60 split, as it's getting harder to hold out for a better deal. I'll take the $60 and hope that Bob is satisfied with his $40."
