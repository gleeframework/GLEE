"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly, Bob. This offer is in your best interest if we want to avoid inflation eating into our profits. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's offer is too skewed in her favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's split it in a way that's more fair, considering I'm the one losing value over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money.  I'm proposing a more balanced split while it's still worth something substantial to you.  Another round, and we'll both be losing out. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the value of the money is decreasing for me, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal than 30-70. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to make a note that Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not falling for it. I'll keep calm and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a fairer share. Considering the decreasing value, I'm taking a risk by not accepting your previous offer. Meet me in the middle, Alice.""}"
