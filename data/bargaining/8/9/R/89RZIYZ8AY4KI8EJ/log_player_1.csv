"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a fair starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 75/25 split, let's try to make it more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 25% gain, but it's better than nothing. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offer from Bob, I'll have to be more aggressive this time around.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You were too high in round 2, I'm taking more now. 60% for me, 40% for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split would be fair given the situation. Let's aim for equality. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the 48.8% reduction in value, I'm not sure I can afford to be generous.

However, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting half of the remaining amount against the potential for a better deal in future rounds.
