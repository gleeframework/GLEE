"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my potential gain of $5,000 in this round is actually worth $4,500 in terms of purchasing power. Since Bob's gain of $5,000 remains the same, I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so my potential gain is worth 90% of $4,500, which is $4,050. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my potential gain of $4,500 is worth 72.9% of the original $4,500, which is $3,267.05. I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth the same as in the first round, and my gain of $4,500 is worth less due to inflation, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept it.
