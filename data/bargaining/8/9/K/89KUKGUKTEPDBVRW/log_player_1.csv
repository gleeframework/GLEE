"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable and generous offer. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time.  Let's avoid letting inflation eat away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for you""
}
```

I've taken into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less for Bob now, so I'm offering him a slightly smaller share than before. I still think this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially with inflation looming. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
