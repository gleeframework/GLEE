Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share this time, but you'll get a chance to propose next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal is too skewed in Alice's favor, and I believe I can come up with a more balanced division. Let's see what happens next!"
