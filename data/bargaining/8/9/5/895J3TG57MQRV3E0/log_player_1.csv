"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm still keeping a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
