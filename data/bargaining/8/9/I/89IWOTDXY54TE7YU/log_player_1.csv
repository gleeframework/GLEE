"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'm now considering the offer.

Since I'm gaining 60 and the money is worth 5% less, I'm actually gaining 57 (60 * 0.95).

Bob is gaining 40, which is worth 20% less, so he's actually gaining 32 (40 * 0.8).

This offer is still a bit unfavorable to me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, hoping he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation adjustment, I'm gaining 65, but the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'm actually gaining 55.66 (65 * 0.8626).

Bob is gaining 35, which is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so he's actually gaining 18.02 (35 * 0.512).

This offer is still not great for me, but it's slightly more favorable than the previous offers. I'll accept this offer.
