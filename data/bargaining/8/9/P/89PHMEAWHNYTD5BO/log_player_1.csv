Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that.  Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the bigger share this time.  We both still get more than we would if we keep rejecting offers. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
