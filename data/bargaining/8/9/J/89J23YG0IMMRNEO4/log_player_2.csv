"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer won't be on the table for long. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\n###\n\nI'd rather take my chances on getting a better deal in the next round than accepting an offer that gives me only 10% of the total amount. The threat of the offer not being on the table for long doesn't scare me, as I'm willing to take the risk of potentially getting a better offer in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than what you offered.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I want to try to reach a deal quickly while still getting a reasonable share. I'm offering Alice 40% of the total amount, which I think is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for you! This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money for me and Alice's claim that this is her final offer, I think it's time to accept the deal. While I was hoping for a better offer, 35% of the original amount is still a significant gain, and I don't want to risk Alice following through on her threat and ending negotiations. I'll take the 3500 dollars and end the game here."
