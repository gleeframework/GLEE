Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 51/49 split is fairer, and it gives us both a good chunk of the money. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
