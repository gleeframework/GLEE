"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'm essentially getting $400,000, which is a bit less than my initial proposal. On the other hand, Bob is getting $600,000, which is more than his share in my initial proposal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the drastic reduction in the value of my potential gain, I'll need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a significant improvement from my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk getting even less.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point.
