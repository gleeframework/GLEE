Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish quickly!""

This offer gives me $80 and Bob $20, which is a relatively generous starting point."
