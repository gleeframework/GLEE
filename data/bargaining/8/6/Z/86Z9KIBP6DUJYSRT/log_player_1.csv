"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and take $600,000. What do you think?""
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 45% is a good deal for me, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 52% and you can have 48%. It's a fair split, and we can end this game now.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is getting closer to my target.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 58% is enough for me, considering the significant decrease in the value of the money. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is my last chance. I'll take 65% and you can have 35%. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I think it's the best I can do.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
