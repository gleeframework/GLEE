"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting $7,000 and Bob getting $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but we need to work together to make sure we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm looking for a better deal. The 45:55 split is still a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not convinced that we're working together to get a good deal. I'll pass on this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better share""}

I'm proposing a 6:4 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
