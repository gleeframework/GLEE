"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000 and keep 6000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for myself. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept a 50/50 split. I'm currently offering 5000, which is 16.67% less than what I initially proposed (6000). I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. I'll give you 4500, and I'll keep 5500 for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if this is enough for you. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation adjustment, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I need to be careful not to get too greedy.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if 5800 is enough for me. I was initially looking for a 50/50 split, but due to inflation, the value of the money has decreased significantly. However, 5800 is a decent offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better one.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
