"Round 1
Alice's offer:

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it seems fair now, I know that with each round, the money becomes less valuable. I want to see if I can get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than 50/50. I'm offering you 40, and I'll take 60.  Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slight discount, but I'm still looking for a better deal than 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I still think I can get a better deal, the inflation is starting to bite.  I'm getting a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
