"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm offering a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than 50/50. I'm offering you 40, and I'll take 60.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in 60/40. I'll do better than 50/50, but I need a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight discount, but I'm still looking for a better deal than 50/50.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
