"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we have 11 more rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more balanced split. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise on 60/40, but I want a slightly better deal. How about 6,000 for me and 4,000 for you?""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm still aiming for a compromise, but with a slightly better deal for myself."
