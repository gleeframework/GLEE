"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to haggle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer. Here is my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Splitting it down the middle seems fair, and I'm happy to end the game here!"
