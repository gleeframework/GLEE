"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. This gives us both a good amount.""
}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer, hoping Bob will see it as reasonable and take it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a split that reflects the time pressure we're both under. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for me! Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a better deal for you than last round, considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""
}
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly to make the offer more appealing to Bob, while still aiming for a larger share. The reminder about inflation should add pressure for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still not a good deal for me. Bob is clearly trying to push his luck, but I'm holding firm for a better split.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. A perfectly even split.  Take it before the inflation eats away at your share even further.""
}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split now. It's a strong statement that shows I'm willing to be fair, but I'm also not budging on getting a reasonable share. The emphasis on inflation is crucial here to push Bob towards acceptance."
