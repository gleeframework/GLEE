"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand your point about the inflation, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile for me. How about this?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This is the best I can do now. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve a larger share considering the inflation only affects you. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hitting Bob hard. While a 50/50 split seemed fair, Alice is unlikely to agree to it based on her previous offers. Accepting 43 dollars now is better than risking getting even less in future rounds where the inflation will further erode the value."
