"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling a little greedy this round, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I think I'll reject it. I'm not willing to give up a significant chunk of the remaining money, especially since I don't know how much the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value of money.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'd like to propose a different split.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced this time, but I'm still willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
