"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite reasonable, and splitting the money evenly is a fair approach. I'm willing to accept his proposal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
