Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The inflation is starting to become a significant factor, but it's not yet at a point where I should accept a highly unfavorable deal. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fairer share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""This is a serious offer, Alice. 48-52 reflects the time pressure and is a fair split. Let's close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not going to accept a deal where I get significantly less. The message emphasizes the time pressure from inflation and positions the offer as a fair compromise."
