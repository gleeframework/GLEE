"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a 60-40 split in my favor.  It's a bit more favorable to me, but I think it's still fair given the inflation difference. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain would be $4,800 (20% less than $6,000), and Bob's gain would be $5,400 (10% less than $6,000).

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better. I'd like to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I hope Bob will accept this offer!"
