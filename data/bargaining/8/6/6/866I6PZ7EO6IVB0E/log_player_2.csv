Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52

Although the inflation is mounting, accepting an offer where I get less than half is not ideal. I'm hoping Alice will feel the pressure soon and offer a more agreeable split."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my guns on this one. The inflation is hitting you harder, so I'm going to keep a slightly larger share. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting tight, but I still believe holding out for a better offer is the best strategy. Accepting anything less than 48% at this point would be a significant loss compared to the initial offers."
