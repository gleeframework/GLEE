"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script.  I'll take 60% this time, but we can work out a more even split later if you like. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate.

I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with 60-40, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 55-45?""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping Bob will be willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still think 52-48 is a fair split. Let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm trying to inch closer to a compromise, hoping Bob will see the value in a more balanced split."
