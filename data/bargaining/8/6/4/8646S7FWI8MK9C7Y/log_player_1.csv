"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting a 7:3 split as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $500,000 x 0.9 = $450,000
Bob gain: $500,000 x 0.9 = $450,000

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
