Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed taking its toll, but I still believe I can get a better deal. Come on, Bob, let's make it happen 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware of the impact of inflation, but she's still trying to push for a larger share. While her offers are slowly getting more reasonable, waiting her out will likely lead to better offers in the next few rounds, even considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my guns on this one.  A near-even split is the most sensible option considering the time pressure and inflation.  Let's be realistic and end this.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly.  We're past the halfway point, and it's getting riskier to hold out for much longer.
* **Shifting Power:** As the rounds progress, Alice's potential gains are diminishing at a faster rate than mine. This gives me a slight advantage in the negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  By sticking close to a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about a fair deal while still trying to secure a slight edge for myself."
