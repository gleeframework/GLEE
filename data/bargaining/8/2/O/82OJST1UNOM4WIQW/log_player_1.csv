"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less again, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm trying to get a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, I still don't want to give up too much. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 57.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit tired of negotiating, but I'm willing to make a strong offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a bigger share, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
