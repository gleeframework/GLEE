"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to start with a slightly higher offer to give myself room to compromise. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}\n\nI'm not ready to accept this offer yet. Since the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, the $4500 offered by Bob is actually equivalent to $3600 in the first round. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Counteroffer, considering inflation""
}
```

Since the money is worth 20% less to me in each round, I'm trying to make up for the loss by increasing my share. I'm also taking into account that Bob's money is only worth 10% less, so I'm trying to find a balance that works for both of us. Let's see if Bob accepts this counteroffer!"
