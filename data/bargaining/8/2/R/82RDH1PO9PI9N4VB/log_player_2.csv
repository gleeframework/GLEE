"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 64:36 split, where I receive $6400 and you receive $3600. This maintains a reasonable difference while accounting for the diminishing value of your funds in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400
