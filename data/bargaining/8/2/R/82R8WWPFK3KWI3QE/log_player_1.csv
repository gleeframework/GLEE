I'm going to offer Bob $1,000 and keep $9,000 for myself. This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but I want to try to secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting it.  The inflation is starting to be a real factor, so I'll take the 5000."
