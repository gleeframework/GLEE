"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point for us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's try to find a middle ground!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the 10% decrease in value for me, so I'm trying to get a bit more than the initial 40 Alice offered. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a fair compromise. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation affects you, but my offer is more than fair. Let's settle this now and both get something. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial one, I still think I can get a more favorable deal. Considering the inflation, I'd like to try to get closer to the 55 I offered in the previous round. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Let's continue the game!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I understand we both want to settle, but I need to account for the growing inflation impact on my end. This is as low as I'm comfortable going. Let's wrap this up!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've slightly increased my proposed gain from the previous round, considering the additional 10% decrease in value due to inflation. I'm trying to convey to Alice that I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable amount, and I'm hoping she'll see the sense in settling now rather than risking further decreases in value. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We need to settle this now. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my end, a 50/50 split at this point is actually a relatively good deal for me. Since the money is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I'm effectively getting more value than the initial offer. I think it's wise to accept this offer and settle the game now, rather than risking further decreases in value. Let's end the game here!"
