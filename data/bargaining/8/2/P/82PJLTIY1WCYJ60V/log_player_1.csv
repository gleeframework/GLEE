"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this case, I will propose a division that slightly favors me but still offers Bob a substantial amount, considering the decreasing value of money for him with each round. My offer and message in JSON format are as follows:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the future rounds' devaluation for you.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and for Bob to take $450,000, with a message encouraging a fair split that considers the impact of future rounds on Bob's share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we'll both be happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
