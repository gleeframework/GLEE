"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred my original offer, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking further inflation.  It's a fair deal under the circumstances."
