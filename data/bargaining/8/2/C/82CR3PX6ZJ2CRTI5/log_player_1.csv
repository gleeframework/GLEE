"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 6,000 and Bob will take 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll give you 70-30, is this more to your liking? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob is offering a 70-30 split, which is closer to my original 60-40 proposal, I'm tempted to accept. However, I'm still not getting as much as I wanted.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to get closer to 50-50. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle at 50-50, a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both take 5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm still hoping for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 2,000, but I'm also not eager to go back to the negotiation table.
