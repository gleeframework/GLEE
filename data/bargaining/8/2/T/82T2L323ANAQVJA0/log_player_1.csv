Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm aiming for the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, given the inflation and the fact that I don't know how it affects Bob, a 50/50 split seems like the best option to ensure I get something."
