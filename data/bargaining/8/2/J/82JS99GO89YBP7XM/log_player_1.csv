"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It seems like a fair starting point given the inflation disadvantage Bob faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the inflation and the limited rounds."
