"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it early on and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, getting $5000 is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
