Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle for now, this way both of us are happy.  It's the most fair deal that ensures we both get a significant amount.  We can always adjust the split later if we want to. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
