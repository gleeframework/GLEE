"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take the majority! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take the majority, huh?

Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll consider the actual value of the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get 400,000, which is worth 95% of the original 500,000 (since 5% was lost to inflation). That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each of the previous two rounds), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up enough, I'm taking more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take even more!

Considering the cumulative inflation effect, my gain of 300,000 is worth only 85.74% of the original 500,000 (since 5% was lost in the first round, 10% in the second, and 14.26% in the third). That's a significant reduction in value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can get a better deal in future rounds.
