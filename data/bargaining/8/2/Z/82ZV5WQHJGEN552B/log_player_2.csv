Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but your previous offer was too unfavorable.  This is a much fairer split that accounts for the devaluation, but still gives you a significant share. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster devaluation of her share. While 400,000 is a decent chunk, waiting her out is still beneficial. In the next round, I'll have more leverage to propose a much more favorable split, even with the devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The value is slipping away with each round. This is my final offer, take it or I'll propose an even smaller share for you next time. ""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Time:** Alice is feeling the pressure of the devaluation more than me. By Round 4, her share is worth significantly less, making her more likely to accept a less favorable offer.
* **Strong Stance:**  The message is framed as an ultimatum, putting the pressure on Alice to accept. While I might be willing to go slightly lower in Round 5, this strong stance might be enough to get her to concede.
* **Balancing Greed and Reason:** I'm aiming for a significant majority, but I'm also aware that pushing too hard might backfire and lead to even lower gains in later rounds."
