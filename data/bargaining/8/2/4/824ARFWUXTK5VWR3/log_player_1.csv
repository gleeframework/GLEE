"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll assume my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $4,000 / 0.9 = $4,444.44 in the first round's value.

Similarly, Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth $6,000 / 0.95 = $6,315.79 in the first round's value.

Considering the relative values, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm offering to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to reach a compromise."
