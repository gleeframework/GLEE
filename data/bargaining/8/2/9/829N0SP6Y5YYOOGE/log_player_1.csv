"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. I take 75$, and you take 25$. Let me know if this works for you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split.  Let's each take half of the remaining money after a small deduction for my trouble in making this offer.  How does that sound? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
