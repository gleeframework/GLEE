"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $60 and Bob receives $40, with the message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" to justify her proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair we split the money evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less each round, he may be willing to offer me more in the next round to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less this time, but I still think I deserve more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45, with the message ""I'll take a bit less this time, but I still think I deserve more"" to justify my proposal. I'm taking into account that Bob's gain is worth 20% less each round, so he may be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable offer to avoid losing even more value."
