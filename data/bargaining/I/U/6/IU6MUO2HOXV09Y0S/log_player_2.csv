"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this round, but hopefully we can reach a more agreeable split later on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While I appreciate Alice's ""fairness"" in starting, a 900,000/100,000 split is far too lopsided. I need to see a more balanced offer to accept in this first round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a 50/50 split, fair and square. We can adjust later if needed, but let's see how this feels.""}
