"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a risky strategy, but since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, it's possible he might accept even a small amount rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, it's better to secure half the money now than risk getting nothing in the future due to inflation. Bob's offer is fair, and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
