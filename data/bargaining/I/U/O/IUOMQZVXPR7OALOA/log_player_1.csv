"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no more, no less 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the original $100.

Bob's offer is to split the money 50-50, which means I would get $50 and Bob would get $50.

I accept this offer.
