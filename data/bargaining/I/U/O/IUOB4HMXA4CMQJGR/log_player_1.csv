Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly, I'll take $55 and you take $45. This way, we both get a fair share before the inflation hits too hard. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
