Let's see what Alice offers next!  It's worth waiting to see if we can get a better deal, especially with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation we'll both face in the next round. Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's in my best interest to accept. The inflation is hitting me harder than Alice, and the offer is still better than what I'd get if we keep going. It's better to take a slightly smaller slice than risk losing out on a larger one later."
