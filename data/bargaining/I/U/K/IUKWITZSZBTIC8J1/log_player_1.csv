"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the money, which is a good starting point, and leaves Bob with 40% of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
