"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since the money loses value over time, and I lose less value than Bob, I should try to end the game as quickly as possible while still being somewhat fair. By offering Bob a significant amount, I'm hoping he'll accept and we can both walk away with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since I already offered Bob a significant amount in the first round and he rejected it, I'm not willing to accept an even split now that the money is worth less. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal, taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more. Let's settle this!""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since Bob rejected my initial offer and I rejected his even split, I'll try to push for a slightly better deal, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will realize that the money is losing value quickly and accept my offer to minimize his losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 42 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since Bob is willing to compromise and offer me 55, which is close to my initial offer, I'll accept it. The money has already lost significant value due to inflation, and I don't want to risk losing even more value by prolonging the game. By accepting this offer, I'm securing a relatively good deal, considering the circumstances."
