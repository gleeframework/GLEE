Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take 60% since I'm taking on more risk with the inflation.""}"

# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 55/45 split is more reflective of the risk we're both taking. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
