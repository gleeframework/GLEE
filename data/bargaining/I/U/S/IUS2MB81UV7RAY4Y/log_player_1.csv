"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a clean slate. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I get all the money, but I'm giving Bob the chance to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way, and we can both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A more reasonable proposal from Bob!

I'll accept his offer. It's indeed a fair split, and we can both get something.
