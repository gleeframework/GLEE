I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted by the chance to get anything at all, even if it's a small amount.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Even with the 5% inflation, getting $5000 is a significant amount of money. It's better than risking getting less in the next round, especially since I don't know how inflation affects Bob's offers."
