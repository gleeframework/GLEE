This is a classic negotiation game. I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, but I also want to show that I'm willing to compromise.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's important to consider the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money, and with the inflation factor, waiting another round may not be beneficial."
