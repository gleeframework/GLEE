"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm happy with a 60/40 split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. I think this is a fair compromise after the inflation, and it avoids further rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### I'll accept the offer since the money's value is decreasing rapidly for me, and further negotiations might lead to a worse outcome. A 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point.\n\n###"
