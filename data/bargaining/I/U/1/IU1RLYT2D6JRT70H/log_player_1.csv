"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money for myself, leaving a small token amount for Bob. This is a risky strategy, as he could reject it and force me to offer him more in the next round. However, since we only have 12 rounds, I believe it's important to establish a strong position early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best option. I am losing money with each passing round, so getting 100,000 now is better than potentially getting a smaller share later.  This also sets a precedent for future rounds, showing Bob that I am willing to compromise."
