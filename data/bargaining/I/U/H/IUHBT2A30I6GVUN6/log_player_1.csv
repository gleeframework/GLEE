"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a bigger share next time if you don't accept. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider that in my decision. If I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, which is a significant decrease from the $500,000 I initially proposed.

However, Bob's message is intriguing. If I reject this offer, I'll get a chance to make a proposal in the next round, which might give me a better outcome. On the other hand, if I accept this offer, I'll get a smaller share now, but Bob has promised to give me a bigger share next time.

For now, I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share this time.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, with me getting $450,000 and Bob getting $550,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much control. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, my $400,000 gain is worth even less than the $300,000 I would have gotten in the previous round. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

Bob's message suggests that he's still holding back, and I don't want to give up too much control either. I think I'll...
