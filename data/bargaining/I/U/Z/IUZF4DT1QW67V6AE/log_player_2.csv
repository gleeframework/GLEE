"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This seems like a fair split to me for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, my turn! This split makes more sense now. Let's wrap this up.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is still generous considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out! This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this needs to be somewhat reasonable for me. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. While getting a 60/40 split in Alice's favor isn't ideal, waiting any longer will only result in an even worse deal for Bob. Accepting Alice's offer, while not great, avoids the risk of an even smaller share in future rounds."
