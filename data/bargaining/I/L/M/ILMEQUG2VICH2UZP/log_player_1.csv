Thanks for playing the game with me! If you want to play again, feel free to start a new round.\n\n###\n\nHuman: You earned 5800 dollars but due to inflation, the money is worth 10% less each round. In total, you lost 11 rounds of inflation (from round 1 to round 12 but not including the last round). Your total amount of money is worth 10% * 11 = 110% less.\n\n###\n\nAssistant: I didn't think about that. So, my $5800 is actually worth a lot less due to inflation. Let me calculate... 110% less is the same as 10% of the original amount. So, I have 10% of $5800, which is... $580. Oh well, at least I got something out of it! Thanks for the game, it was a fun negotiation!"
