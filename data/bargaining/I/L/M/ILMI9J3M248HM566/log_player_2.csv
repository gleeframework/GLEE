**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer in round 3 was slightly better than her offer in round 1, due to inflation, the actual amount of money I would receive is significantly less.  

In round 4, I'm making the same offer as I did in round 2. This is because:

* My gain from round 2, adjusted for inflation, is still better than Alice's offer in round 3.
* This offer gives me the best possible chance to get a deal. 

It's a gamble, as Alice might reject again, but it's the best strategy based on the available information."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is biting:**  My potential gains have been significantly reduced by inflation, and this offer is better than the previous one.
* **Alice's offer is improving:** While I'd prefer more, Alice is showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting and continuing the game carries a high risk that Alice will continue to offer less, or that inflation will further decrease my gains. 

Even with the substantial inflation hit, this offer is the best chance I have at a reasonable payout."
