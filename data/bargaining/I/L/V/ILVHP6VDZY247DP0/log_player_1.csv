Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I'll get 60 dollars and Bob will get 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make a decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 70/30 split, as I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
