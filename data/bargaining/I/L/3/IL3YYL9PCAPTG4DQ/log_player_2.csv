# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic and pressure me.  While my potential gains are shrinking, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting anything less than 50% at this stage would be a loss compared to starting with $50 each."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""}
```"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, don't be stubborn 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting dire.  While I want a 50/50 split,  the impact of inflation means even this offer is better than holding out and getting a slightly better deal in later rounds. Accepting now cuts my losses."
