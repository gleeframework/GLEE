"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""My turn. This offer is better for you than waiting.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:**  Alice's opening offer was heavily skewed in her favor. By rejecting it, we signal we're not pushovers.
* **Time Pressure:**  Inflation hurts Alice more than me. This round's offer is still generous to her, considering the money will be worth less if she waits. 
* **Strategic Justification:** The message implies it's in Alice's best interest to accept now, adding a layer of persuasion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than you offered 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is barely budging. Her offer is only slightly better than her first one, despite the increasing pressure from inflation.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this, we see how desperate Alice is getting. If she offers significantly more in the next round, it shows our strategy is working. 
* **Not Desperate Yet:** We're only on round 3.  There's still room to negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at this deal. Let's be reasonable and split it fairly.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, But Firm:** We're lowering our demand slightly to show flexibility, but not by much. The offer is now closer to a ""fair"" split.
* **Highlighting Urgency:**  The message directly points out the shrinking pot. This aims to make Alice more agreeable to avoid further losses.
* **Framing:**  The ""reasonable"" and ""fairly"" wording attempts to position our offer as the logical, non-greedy choice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Slow:** While Alice is finally moving closer to the middle, her concessions are still too small. Inflation is rapidly eroding the value, and this offer isn't keeping pace.
* **Holding Strong:** We've presented reasonable offers. Backing down now might signal desperation and encourage Alice to hold out for even less. 
* **Time for a Bluff?**  We might be approaching a point where we need to raise our demand to create a sense of urgency and potentially scare Alice into accepting a more favorable deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5700,
""alice_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calculated Risk:** We're raising the stakes with a bluff. This creates a sense of urgency and finality, potentially pushing Alice to accept a less favorable deal.
* **Inflation Advantage:** We're using our slower inflation rate to our advantage. The longer this drags on, the more the diminishing value hurts Alice. 
* **Strong Language:** The ""final offer"" statement is a powerful tactic. It shows we're serious and unwilling to negotiate further. While risky, it could lead to Alice accepting our terms out of fear of getting even less later. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy hinges on Alice believing our bluff. If she calls it, we might need to drastically adjust our approach in the following rounds."
