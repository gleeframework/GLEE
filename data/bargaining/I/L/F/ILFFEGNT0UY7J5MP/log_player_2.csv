**Reasoning:**

The game has strong elements of the classic ""Ultimatum Game"" where acting rationally often conflicts with our sense of fairness. 

Here's why I'm accepting, even though it doesn't feel great:

* **Time Pressure:** We're over halfway through the rounds, and inflation is eating away at my potential gains.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share. There's no guarantee she'll budge much, even with inflation on my side.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While 43 isn't great after inflation, rejecting and hoping for 50/50 in a later round means risking even less if Alice continues to play hardball.

**It's important to note:** In a real game, understanding your opponent's personality and risk tolerance is key.  Alice might be bluffing, but I'm not willing to gamble on it at this point.
