"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $427,500.

I'm not thrilled with the 55-45 split, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'd rather not risk going to another round with the money losing value.
