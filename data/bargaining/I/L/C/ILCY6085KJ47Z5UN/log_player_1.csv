"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, as I am less affected by inflation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob has increased his share, the inflation has also significantly impacted the value of my portion. I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting this offer and pushing for a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I am offering a more balanced split this round, recognizing that Bob's share decreased significantly due to inflation. This offer is still favorable to me, considering the inflation affecting my share, and I hope it will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600

While inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, this offer provides a relatively stable gain for me. It's important to consider the risk of further rounds, where the value of the money will continue to decrease. Accepting this offer minimizes the potential loss due to inflation."
