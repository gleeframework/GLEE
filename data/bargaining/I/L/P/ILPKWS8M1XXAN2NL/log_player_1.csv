"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, my initial proposal would have been $5,400 for me and $3,600 for Bob.

Considering Bob's counteroffer, I'm not too thrilled about giving him the majority of the money, but I'm willing to meet him in the middle. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal for Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less in the third round, my initial proposal would have been $5,400 for me and $3,600 for Bob, but since the money is worth 10% less, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $4,200 and Bob receives $5,800. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet exactly in the middle, no more, no less. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less in the fourth round, my initial proposal would have been $4,560 for me and $3,440 for Bob, but since the money is worth 27.1% less, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

Considering Bob's new offer, meeting exactly in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer and we can split the $10,000 (now worth less due to inflation) equally, with each of us receiving $5,000."
