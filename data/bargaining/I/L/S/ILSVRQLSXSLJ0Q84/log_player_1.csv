"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can get started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more strategic now. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a larger share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
