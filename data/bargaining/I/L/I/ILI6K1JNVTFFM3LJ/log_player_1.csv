"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

This is a relatively even split, with me getting 80% and Bob getting 20%. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a more favorable split for himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in my favor. I think I can do better than that. The game is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, with me getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
