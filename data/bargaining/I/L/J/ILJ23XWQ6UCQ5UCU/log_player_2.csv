Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more since you started with more.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is losing value due to inflation, accepting this offer to split it evenly seems like the best option to avoid further loss."
