"Round 1

I propose taking $9,000 and giving Bob $1,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer. I am aiming for a large share early on, but I recognize the importance of keeping Bob engaged and preventing him from getting too frustrated."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,000 now due to the inflation, it's not a good long-term strategy. I need to keep pushing for a larger share, especially since inflation is working against me. By rejecting this offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can propose a fairer distribution in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share slightly to $7,000, but still aiming for a significant portion.  This demonstrates flexibility while still reflecting the impact of inflation. Hopefully this will encourage Bob to consider a more balanced offer in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Despite the significant impact of inflation, taking $2,000 is not a good long-term solution.  Bob's offer is still very unbalanced, and I need to continue negotiating for a fairer share. While time is running out, I believe I can still secure a more favorable outcome with a few strategic moves."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. The inflation is significantly impacting my gains, and I need to secure a reasonable share before it's too late. A 50/50 split is the most fair and balanced solution, and it avoids a complete breakdown of the negotiations.  This offer shows a willingness to compromise, which might encourage Bob to accept."
