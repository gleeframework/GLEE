"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is 50% of the current $10,000, which is a more even split than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer to avoid risking a worse deal in future rounds.
