"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money over rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While this seems like a ""fair"" share, it's important to remember the inflation rates. The value of the money is going to decrease more quickly for Alice than for Bob. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I propose a 55:45 split in my favor. While I understand the decreasing value of money, it's still important to consider a more equitable division. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.""
