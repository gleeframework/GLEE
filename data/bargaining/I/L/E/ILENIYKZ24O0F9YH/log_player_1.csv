"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in my favor. While I understand the decreasing value of money, it's still important to consider a more equitable division. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
