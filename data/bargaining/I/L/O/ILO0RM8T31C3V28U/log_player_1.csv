"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to be greedy and propose a 99/1 split in my favor.  It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it's the best possible offer for me in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting offers."
