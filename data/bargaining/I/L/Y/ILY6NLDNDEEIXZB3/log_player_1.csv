"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the difference""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting that he should accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, his offer is actually equivalent to him offering me $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for himself.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's a fair one. I'll accept it.
