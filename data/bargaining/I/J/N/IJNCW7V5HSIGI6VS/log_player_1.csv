"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that heavily favors me. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small amount in the first round, as he doesn't know about the inflation factor yet. This gives me a good head start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth 20% less, Bob's offer gives me a significant amount. In the next round, my share will be even smaller due to inflation, and I don't want to risk losing more. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the remaining value."
