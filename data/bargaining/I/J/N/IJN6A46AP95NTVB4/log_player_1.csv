Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% of the money, which is a fair share considering the inflation rate is 0% for me and 5% for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
