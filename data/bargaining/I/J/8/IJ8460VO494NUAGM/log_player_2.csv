"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40. It's better to secure a deal now before inflation eats into our profits.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your turn, Alice.  I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  Let's split the difference from my previous offer - $55 for me, $45 for you.  This deal makes sense for both of us before inflation eats away at it any further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
