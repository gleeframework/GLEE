"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI have offered a 60-40 split, with me receiving $60 and Bob receiving $40. I included the message ""Let's be fair"" to convey that I believe this is a reasonable and equitable division of the money. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose.  Let's split the difference from your offer, slightly in my favor to make up for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI have decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer is closer to a 50-50 split, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation rates. The 5% decrease in value for me is less than the 10% decrease in value for Bob, so I'm willing to take the risk and make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nI have offered a 57-43 split, with me receiving $57 and Bob receiving $43. My message suggests that this offer is a compromise between our previous proposals, taking into account the effects of inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, considering that the value of the money is decreasing more rapidly for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. I'm taking another small hit from inflation, so let's end this now before we both lose more. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI have decided to accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, especially for Bob, I believe this offer is reasonable. The difference between our gains is relatively small, and further rounds would only lead to more losses for both of us. It's better to settle for $49 now rather than risking an even lower amount in the next round."
