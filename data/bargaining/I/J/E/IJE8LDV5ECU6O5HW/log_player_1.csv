"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see if we can do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value for Bob's gain, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Considering the offer, I'll reject it for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the uneven split. I'd like to see a more balanced proposal from you.""
}
```

It's now Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair compromise given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slight concession from my initial 50-50 offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
