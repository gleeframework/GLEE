I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60."

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer was rejected, and now Bob is making a counteroffer. Considering the 5% inflation, I'll have to be more careful with the numbers. Since Bob's offer is still quite close to the original $100, I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 10% total inflation now, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to get a bit more, but not too greedy.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is really taking a toll now! With the 24.26% total reduction in value, I'll have to be more aggressive. I'll try to get a bigger share while it's still worth something.
