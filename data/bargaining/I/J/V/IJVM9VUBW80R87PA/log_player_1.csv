"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I propose to take 95 dollars and leave Bob with 5 dollars.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority share but still leaves Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure how much the inflation is affecting Bob's offers. Accepting this ensures I get something, and it's a significant increase from the previous round."
