"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and can discuss further from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that I get a slightly larger share since I'm the one making the offer this time. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 20% less than before, I'll have to adjust my expectations. In this round, I'll gain $4,000, which is equivalent to $3,200 in the previous round's value.

I'm not thrilled about giving up $3,200, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping we can negotiate a better deal in the next round.
