"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too aggressive, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $60 is worth 90% of the original $70, so it's $63. And Bob's gain of $40 is worth 83.33% of the original $30, so it's $33.33.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
