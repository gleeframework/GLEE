I propose taking $9,000 for myself and giving Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm willing to lower my share a bit to see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm offering $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm getting a bit concerned about the dwindling money.  I'm offering $7,500 for myself and $2,500 for Bob.  This is getting closer to a compromise, but I still need to ensure a reasonable share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this is a better offer than the previous one, it is still not a good deal considering the significant inflation affecting Bob's share more than mine. I need to maintain a reasonable share to make this worthwhile, given the diminishing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable share considering the inflation. I'm offering $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal, it still isn't enough considering the inflation rates. I'm concerned that the money is losing value quickly for both of us, and I need to ensure a decent share for myself to justify accepting it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground here. With each passing round, the value of the money is dropping rapidly. I propose $6500 for myself and $3500 for Bob. This seems like a reasonable compromise to avoid both of us losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a difficult decision, but given the rapid rate of inflation, especially for Bob, I think accepting this offer is the best course of action.  While it's less than I initially wanted, it's still a decent amount, and the risk of getting nothing is too high at this point."
