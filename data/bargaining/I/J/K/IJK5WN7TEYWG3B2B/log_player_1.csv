"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation and the fact that I get to make the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation factor.  It's also a better outcome than the potential risk of further rounds."
