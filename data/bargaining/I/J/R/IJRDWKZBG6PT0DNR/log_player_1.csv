"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better offer in round 1, now it's my turn to make a better one! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original value, so $6,000 is now worth $4,800 to me.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $3,000, which is worth $2,400 to me now. This is a significant decrease from my original offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you say?""
}

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of the original value, so $3,072 is now worth $1,570.56 to me.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $4,000, which is worth $2,048 to me now. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.
