"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 in a 4:1 ratio. This might seem like a lot, but remember, the value of money decreases by 20% with each round. So, securing more now could be beneficial.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the $100 equally. This way, both of us benefit without risking any potential loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
