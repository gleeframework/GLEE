"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game over as soon as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60, you can have 40, but it's not the best deal! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is the best deal, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's offer is 60, I'll calculate my gain in the first round, which was 50, and compare it to the current offer.

My gain in the first round was 50, and now it's worth 95% of that, which is 47.5. So, Bob is offering me 60, which is more than my gain in the first round, but less than 47.5 after inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 90.5% of what it was in the first round.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45, which is 10 less than my initial gain in the first round, and 9 less than the current value of my gain after inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not being too generous! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round.

I'll calculate the current value of my gain in the first round, which was 50, and see how much Bob is offering me. Since my gain in the first round is worth 85.74% of its original value, Bob is offering me 65, which is 76.5% of the original 85.74% value.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than what I got in the previous round and I'm running out of time.
