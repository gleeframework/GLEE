"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. This offer is highly in your favor, otherwise I'm taking it all in the next round! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since this is the first round, Bob can try to negotiate for a better deal. Alice's threat of taking it all in the next round is not credible, as Bob will have the opportunity to make a counteroffer. Additionally, accepting this offer would mean Bob gets only 10% of the total amount, which may not be satisfactory for him. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a fair split.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Bob is trying to negotiate for a better deal by offering a split that is more in his favor, but still reasonable for Alice. By framing it as a ""fair split"", Bob is trying to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and increase the chances of her accepting the offer. This offer also gives Bob a significant share of the total amount, while still leaving Alice with a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a fair split, but I'm sure you understand I have to counter. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice's offer is closer to a fair split, Bob may still feel that he can negotiate for a better deal. Since Alice's previous message mentioned that she appreciated Bob's attempt at a fair split, Bob may sense that Alice is willing to compromise. By rejecting this offer, Bob can try to push for an even more favorable split or try to get Alice to meet him in the middle. Additionally, Bob may feel that accepting this offer would mean giving up too much, as he had previously proposed a split where he would receive 600,000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I see we're getting closer. Let's compromise and end this.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. By offering a split of 550,000 for himself and 450,000 for Alice, Bob is attempting to meet Alice halfway between their last two proposals. The message ""I see we're getting closer. Let's compromise and end this"" is an attempt to convey that Bob is willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution, and that he believes this offer is a fair compromise. This approach may appeal to Alice's desire to reach an agreement and end the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's end this. I'll accept your previous offer, but you know it's more than fair. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this round, Alice is offering Bob a deal that is actually worse than his previous offer in Round 4. However, Alice frames it as accepting Bob's previous offer, which might be an attempt to make the offer more palatable to Bob. Despite this, Bob may realize that the negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and Alice is still not willing to meet him at his desired split. Given that the difference between this offer and his previous offer is 100,000, Bob may decide that it's not worth risking another round of negotiation, where Alice could potentially offer an even worse deal or stick to this offer. By accepting this offer, Bob can secure a significant amount of money and end the negotiation."
