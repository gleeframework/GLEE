"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for future inflation.  Let's start with this and see where we go! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm getting a slightly worse deal than before.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60/40 split, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to a 50/50 split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try a 48/52 split and see if we can find common ground.""}

I'm proposing a 48/52 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split than the 60/40 split Bob suggested earlier."
