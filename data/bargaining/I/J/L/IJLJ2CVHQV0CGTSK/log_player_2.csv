# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share, don't wait too long! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me. However, accepting 40% now is a terrible deal. I need to show her I'm willing to risk it going lower to get a more reasonable split.  There's still time, but I might need to concede a bit in the next round or two."

# Alice's message: You should've taken my previous offer, now I'm taking more 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting dangerous, but I'm holding strong. Alice is clearly bluffing, hoping I'll panic as the rounds go on.  I need to call her bluff, but I also need to be prepared to make a significant concession soon to avoid walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal and both go home with something.""}"

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a better one 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough pill to swallow, but time is running out.  Alice is clearly playing hardball, and with the inflation working against me, this is the best I'm likely to get. Accepting now is better than risking getting even less or nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
