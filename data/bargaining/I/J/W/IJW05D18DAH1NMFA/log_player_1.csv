"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since Bob's offer is slightly better than my previous one, but still not as generous as I'd like, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my advantage""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and holding my ground. What do you think, Bob?"

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot. I'll consider his offer...
