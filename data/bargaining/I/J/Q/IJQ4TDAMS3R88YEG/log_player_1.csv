"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'm willing to be generous!""
}
```

This offer gives me $60 and gives Bob $40, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 55 and you can have 45.  It's a good deal, especially considering inflation! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather have a bit more money now than risk waiting for a better offer later. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
