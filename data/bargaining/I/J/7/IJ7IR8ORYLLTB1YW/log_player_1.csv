This is a reasonable starting point.  I'm aiming for a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob will have a slightly less steep discount on his money in future rounds. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than the previous round, and while my discount is higher, the difference in the proposed split isn't big enough to make up for it. I'm going to try and hold out for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair compromise given the escalating inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further discounts on both sides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob is offering a slightly better share to me, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money. It's now worth less than half of what it was initially. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will be willing to make a more equitable proposal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

The inflation is getting pretty serious now, and I need to start considering the declining value of the money. While I still want a larger share, I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid a situation where we both get a very small amount of real value in the end.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this and accept the offer."
