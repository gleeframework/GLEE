# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is suggesting ""compromise"", the deal is getting worse for Bob with each round due to the uneven inflation. It's still beneficial to hold out and hope Alice gets more desperate and offers a larger share.  We're getting into risky territory, but the potential loss from accepting a bad deal now outweighs the risk of getting nothing."
