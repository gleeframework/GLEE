"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate is higher for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a slightly better deal. I'll see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation rates. Let's get this done!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation rates are different, but my previous offer still stands. This is a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a bit more, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling time and inflation.  I'll take the deal."
