I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the value of money is changing.  Let's work together to find a deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous, let's close the deal 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like more, with the inflation rate, this is a decent deal.  Let's end the game!"
