"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3000 is actually worth $2850, and Bob's gain of $7000 is actually worth $5600.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting such a large share, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so it's now worth $2675 (5% less than $2850).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still relatively balanced. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $5000 is worth 14.26% less than the initial $6000, which is approximately $5139.60, but since the money is worth 5% less each round, my gain is worth 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 6000 =  $3838.52

Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 48.8% less than the initial $4000, which is approximately $2064, but since the money is worth 20% less each round, Bob's gain is worth 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 4000 = $1318.40

Considering the actual values, I think I can accept this offer.
