"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but I think we can do better! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll analyze the offer:

* My gain is $600,000, which is 20% less than the $700,000 I proposed in Round 1.
* Bob's gain is $400,000, which is 5% less than the $420,000 he would have gotten in Round 1 if he had accepted my offer.

Considering the inflation adjustment, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
