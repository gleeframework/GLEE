"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% and keep 90%. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm starting with a strong offer, keeping 90% of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money equally, each receiving $500,000. This ensures fairness and prevents the risk of inflation affecting our shares. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't want to split it equally, as I'd be giving up a significant portion of the initial amount. I'll try to negotiate for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to split it equally. I'll give you a counteroffer: I'll take 700,000 and leave you with 300,000. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

Keep in mind that, due to inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 20% less than in the previous round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive with my offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal anywhere else, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm keeping 80% of the remaining amount, which is worth 20% less than in the previous round due to inflation."
