"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want a fair share.  Accept this and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a high-stakes negotiation! While Alice's proposal is ""generous"" in terms of a large number for Bob, it's incredibly lopsided.  Rejecting gives Bob the chance to make a counter-offer that is more fair."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  This is the fairest way to start.""}
