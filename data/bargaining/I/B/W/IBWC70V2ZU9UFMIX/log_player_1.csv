"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 12 rounds between us!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount for the first round, hoping to get a good chunk of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the $500,000 I would gain is now worth $400,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I was hoping to get more money upfront. However, splitting it 50/50 is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially getting even less money due to inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
