"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain is now $570,000. Bob's offer is still a 50-50 split, which seems reasonable considering the circumstances.

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50-50 split.
