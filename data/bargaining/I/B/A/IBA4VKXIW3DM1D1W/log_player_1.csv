Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, given that I am the one taking the risk of inflation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose we split the money evenly.  Since we've both had the chance to reject proposals, this feels like the most fair solution at this point."
