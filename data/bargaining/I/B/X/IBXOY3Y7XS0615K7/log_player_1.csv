Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm taking a greedy approach! Since there's inflation, it's better to secure as much as possible now. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 51 
# Bob gain: 49 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob is taking a bigger share, it's still better than the next round.  Inflation means the money will be worth less next time, so I'll take this offer."
