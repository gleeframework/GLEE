"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to take the even split, but knowing about the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take 60% now, and you can take 40%.  It's a better deal for both of us considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share, but you'll still get a good deal. Let's finalize it! 
# Bob gain: 7000 
# Alice gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a good deal considering the inflation. Alice is offering a decent amount and I'm guaranteed to get something."
