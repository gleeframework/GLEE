Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm not sure I can get a better deal given the inflation. A 50/50 split is fair and I'm happy to accept."
