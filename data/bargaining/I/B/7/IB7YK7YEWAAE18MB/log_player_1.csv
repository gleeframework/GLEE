"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share of the money, but it also leaves Bob with a small portion. This is a starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it. If he doesn't, I can adjust my offer in the next round depending on how much risk he's willing to take with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking a much larger share this time, and I'm not comfortable with that.  Inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my share, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  I believe this offer is fair given the inflation that's occurred and the fact that I'm willing to share more than I did in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is starting to seriously affect my potential gains, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and further rounds could leave me with nothing."
