"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $45 and kept $55 for myself, with the message ""Let's be fair"". Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer. If he accepts, the game ends and we both get the agreed amounts. If he rejects, the game continues to the next round, where Bob will make a new proposal. Remember, with each passing round, the money loses value due to inflation - 5% for me (Alice) and 10% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, that's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer to split the money evenly. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, the $50 I would get in this round is worth 5% less than it was in the first round. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money. Now, it's my turn again to make a proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is fairer""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob $48 and keep $52 for myself, with the message ""Considering inflation, this is fairer"". This offer takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, trying to balance the fairness of the initial offer with the current worth of the money. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round, where he will make a new proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to reach a compromise, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer in Round 4. Despite Bob's willingness to compromise by offering me a slightly larger share of $49, considering the inflation, the value of the money has decreased significantly since the first round. For me, the money is worth 14.26% less, and for Bob, it's worth 27.1% less. Given these circumstances, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable deal, especially since the difference in the value loss due to inflation between us is substantial. I'll make a new proposal in Round 5, aiming to capitalize on this difference."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Inflation affects you more, I take that into account""}\n\nIn Round 5, I've decided to make a more assertive offer, taking into account the significant difference in how inflation affects both of us. I'm proposing that I take $57 and Bob takes $43, with the message ""Inflation affects you more, I take that into account"". Given that the money is worth 14.26% less for me but 27.1% less for Bob compared to the first round, I'm leveraging this disparity to justify a larger share for myself. It's Bob's turn now to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round, where he will make a new proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing value with each round, maybe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 54 
# Bob gain: 46 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn Round 6, considering the significant loss of value due to inflation for both of us, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. Bob's message and offer of $54 for me and $46 for him seem like a genuine attempt to find a middle ground. Given that the money's value continues to decrease with each round, and we're already halfway through the game, the risk of not reaching an agreement and ending up with nothing increases. Accepting this offer ensures that both of us walk away with something, even if it's less than what we initially hoped for. This decision balances the desire to maximize my gain with the risk of potential loss if we fail to agree within the remaining rounds."
