"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject this offer.
