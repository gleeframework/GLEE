Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting less due to inflation, I'm still in a better position to make a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a significant share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more to avoid further inflation."
