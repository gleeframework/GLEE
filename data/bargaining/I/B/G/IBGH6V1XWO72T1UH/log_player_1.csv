"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. We both lose value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is more appealing now, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a bit longer. The inflation disparity means his share continues to decrease in value faster than mine. I'll aim for a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, how about this? It's still a significant amount for you, and we're both losing time.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's try to be reasonable. We're both losing value with each round. This offer is fair and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has met my initial offer from Round 1. While I could potentially push for more in later rounds, the risk of reaching no deal and getting $0 is becoming too high.  It's better to secure a favorable amount now than risk losing everything."
