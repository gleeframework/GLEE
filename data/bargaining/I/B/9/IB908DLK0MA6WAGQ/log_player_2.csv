"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's previous offer was 50/50, I'll try to make a slightly better offer. But I'll also keep in mind that the money is worth 20% less now, so I'll aim for a higher share.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth less than my gain of 60 in the previous round. But I still need to make a decision.

Since Alice's offer is still 55, which is worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept this offer to get a guaranteed 45.
