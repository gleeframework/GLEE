"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'd rather have a slightly larger share of the remaining money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's make it 50/50!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to balance out the effects of inflation and get a fair share of the remaining money."
