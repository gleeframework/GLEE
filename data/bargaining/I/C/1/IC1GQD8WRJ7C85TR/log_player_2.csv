"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money fast. I'm compromising. Let's close this deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the impact of inflation grows. While her offer is better than her first, it's still skewed in her favor. I'm willing to gamble that she'll be forced to offer a much better deal as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and we're both losing money. This is a fair deal that ensures we both walk away with a respectable sum. Don't let greed get the best of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly from Round 2, putting it equal to Alice's previous offer. This signals that I'm serious about getting a larger share while still acknowledging the need for a compromise. The message emphasizes the urgency of the situation and appeals to Alice's rationality by highlighting the potential losses from continued inflation."
