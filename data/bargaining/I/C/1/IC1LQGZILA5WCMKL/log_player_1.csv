"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start with a fair base.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it allows us to test the waters and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about the offer. However, I do appreciate Bob's willingness to make a counteroffer.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split. Can we aim for a 55/45 split or something closer to 50/50?""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to budge!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 52/48 split? It's still a decent compromise, but I think it's a fairer split than the previous offer.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still keeping it relatively close to the original 50/50 split. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still want a bit more. Let's see if we can meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it since Bob is getting closer to my target. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more to get a better deal.

Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm getting closer, but I'd like to aim for a 52.5/47.5 split. It's still a compromise, but I think it's a fairer split considering the inflation.""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more to Bob. How about a 48/52 split? It's still a compromise, but I think it's a fairer split considering the inflation.""}

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I'm not giving away too much, but still making a concession to Bob. Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer!"
