"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from the start. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers in the next round.  It's too early to settle for such a big difference in gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money a little more evenly.  Let's start the game with a more balanced approach.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  This offer is still in your favor considering the inflation. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's not the ideal split, accepting this offer is the best choice considering the inflation. The money is worth less with each passing round, and there's no guarantee that Alice's offer will improve. It's better to secure a reasonable gain now than risk getting a worse deal later."
