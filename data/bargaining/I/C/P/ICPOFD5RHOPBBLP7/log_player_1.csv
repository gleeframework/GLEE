Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 60/40 is a fair split considering the inflation!

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, my share is worth less with each round. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think 58/42 is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is acknowledging the impact of inflation, he's still heavily favoring himself in this deal.  The longer we wait, the more the inflation disparity hurts him. I'm willing to hold out for a slightly better offer."
