"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose that I receive $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. I believe this is a fair initial offer, as it allows for a substantial gain for me while still giving Bob a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm proposing a split of $8,000 for me and $2,000 for Bob.  While I'm willing to lower my share slightly from the previous round, I still believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation impact on the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is significantly lower than I would prefer, the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something, as rejecting it might lead to a complete loss in the next round."
