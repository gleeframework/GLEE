"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I was hoping for a better deal considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less now. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much either. Let's try again!""}

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still a significant concession. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either. Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer. The 75/25 split is a significant improvement from my previous offer, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. Meeting halfway seems like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money."
