Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little more. Let's do 70 for me and 30 for you. This is a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not convinced. I think we can find a more fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can negotiate a little more."
