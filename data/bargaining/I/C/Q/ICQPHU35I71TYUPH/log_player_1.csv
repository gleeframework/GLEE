"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering to give Bob 20% of the initial amount, which is $20. This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation effect, my potential gain is worth 40% less than the initial amount. I'll make a more aggressive offer this time.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to take advantage of the inflation effect and get more value out of my share."
