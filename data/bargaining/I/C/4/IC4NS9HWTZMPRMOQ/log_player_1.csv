"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking 600,000$ and Bob taking 400,000$. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for Bob to accept and end the game."

# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 55% is a fair split.""
}
```
