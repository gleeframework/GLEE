"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $8,000."

# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  No need to get greedy, we both get more this way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my offer would have been worth $7,600, but now I have to consider Bob's offer. 

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it evenly yet."

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my previous offer would have been worth $6,400, but now I need to consider Bob's new offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```

It seems like Bob is serious about settling this, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. $4,000 is a decent share, and I'll take it."
