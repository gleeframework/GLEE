"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I need to consider the value of the money in the current round.

My initial offer was $700,000, which is now worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its original value, which is $810,000.

Bob's offer is $600,000, which is worth 0.95 times its original value, which is $570,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
