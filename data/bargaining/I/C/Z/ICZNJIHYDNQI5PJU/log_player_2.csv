Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we divide the money as follows: I'll take $5250 and you'll receive $4750. This keeps our shares roughly equal to what they would have been without inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250
