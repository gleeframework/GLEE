Let's see if Bob is happy with an 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure I'll get the lion's share since I'm the one making the offer first!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is much worse than the previous one, even considering the inflation. While my gains are now worth 5% less, Bob's gains are worth 10% less, and the offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I'll reject this and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share, but I'm still aiming for a majority.  Bob rejected my previous offer, so I need to show some flexibility, but I'm not going to give in to his ridiculous proposal just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is even worse than the previous one, and the inflation is starting to really hurt! My potential gains are down almost 15%, and Bob's are down over 25%, but the offer is still hugely in his favor.  I'll reject again and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but I'm still holding out for a significant portion of the money. Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse, and I'm hoping to get a deal that's at least somewhat fair, even with the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still bad, but the inflation is starting to become a real problem.  I'm losing over 20% of the potential value of my share, and while Bob's losses are greater, the offer is still significantly in his favor. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal, but the pressure is on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm getting desperate!  This inflation is really hurting, and I'm losing a lot of potential value.  I'm offering a 60/40 split this time, hoping to get at least something decent before Bob gets even more greedy.  I need to get a deal soon, or we'll both be left with nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is killing me.  I'm losing over 30% of the value of my potential gain, but I can't give in yet.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better deal. I need to keep fighting for what's mine!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is getting really risky!  Inflation is eating away at the money, and I'm losing more than 30% of the value.  I'm now proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob sees the writing on the wall and realizes that if we don't reach an agreement soon, we both lose everything.  It's time for a compromise!"
