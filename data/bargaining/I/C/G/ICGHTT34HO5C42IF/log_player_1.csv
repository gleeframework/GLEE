"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was reasonable for Round 1, but now it's my turn to propose a similar split with a slight advantage for me. Let's settle this quickly before inflation eats further into our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, Bob's offer is fair given the circumstances. Accepting now prevents further losses due to inflation."
