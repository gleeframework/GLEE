"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very high share in this first round.  I'm assuming Bob will reject this, but it establishes my position as the one willing to take most of the money. This may also give me some information about how Bob values the money compared to how much he wants to be in control."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial offer. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, acknowledging that Bob is willing to take a lower share. This should be more attractive to Bob while still giving me the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally becoming more reasonable. While I would prefer a higher share, I need to weigh the risk of further inflation and the chance of getting nothing at all.  Accepting a 50/50 split is a good compromise at this point."
