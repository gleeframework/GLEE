"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'm proposing to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

In the first round, I proposed 8000 for myself and 2000 for Bob. Due to inflation, the effective value of the money is decreasing. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting 7000, which is 12.5% of the original amount, while Bob will be getting 3000, which is 30% of the original amount.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Since the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm proposing to take 90% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll recalculate the effective value of the money.

In the first round, I proposed 8000 for myself and 2000 for Bob. Due to inflation, the money is now worth much less.

Bob's offer of 7500 for me and 2500 for him is a relatively good deal, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
