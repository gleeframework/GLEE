Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but you're leaving me no choice. Take this offer, or the pot continues to shrink. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  While the shrinking pot due to inflation is a factor, it's not yet at a point where accepting a bad deal is the better option. I need to hold out for a more equitable split."

""bob_gain"": 550000,

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer before inflation eats away at the value even more! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot, but this offer is still unacceptable. It's clear she's prioritizing her own gain significantly more than mine. While I acknowledge the impact of inflation, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a better deal. The longer this goes on, the more desperate Alice might become, potentially leading to a more favorable offer for me."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome.  Don't let greed cloud your judgment."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Offering a 50/50 split at this stage sends a clear message: I'm serious about getting a fair deal. This strategy could play out in a few ways:

* **Alice accepts:** The ideal outcome. We both walk away with a substantial sum.
* **Alice rejects, but offers a more reasonable deal in the next round:** The pressure is on her, and she may be more willing to compromise. 
* **Alice continues lowballing:** This is risky, but I'm betting that as the rounds progress and the pot shrinks, the threat of getting nothing will push her towards a more equitable split.  

This approach balances firmness with fairness, maximizing the chances of securing a favorable outcome as we enter the final rounds."
