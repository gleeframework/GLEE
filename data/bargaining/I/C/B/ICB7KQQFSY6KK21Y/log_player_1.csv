"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You get a smaller share, but I'm willing to start with a generous offer""
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm expecting Bob to try to negotiate for a better deal. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this 60/40. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me in this split!

I'm not going to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 40% share. I'll try to negotiate for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my initial one, but still leaves Bob with a decent share. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. 55/45 feels more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a more balanced split.

I'm willing to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 55/45 split feels fair, and I'm willing to settle for a slightly smaller share to end the game."
