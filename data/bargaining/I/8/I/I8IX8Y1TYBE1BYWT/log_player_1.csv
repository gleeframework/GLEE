"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I propose a 990,000 to 10,000 split, in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, as it leaves Bob with a small amount but still allows me to secure the majority of the funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Given Bob's aggressive offer in the previous round and the diminishing value of money due to inflation, a fair split seems like the most logical option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's still not ideal, it's better than getting nothing at all, especially with the increasing inflation."
