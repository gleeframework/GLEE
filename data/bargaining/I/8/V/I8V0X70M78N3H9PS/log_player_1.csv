"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I take $55 and Bob takes $45. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases with each round, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it to avoid further devaluation of the money. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while also acknowledging that I'm taking a slightly larger share, which might be seen as a compromise given the decreasing value of money over rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, but keep in mind the money is losing value! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the offer from Bob, where I would gain $45 and he would gain $55, and considering the effect of inflation on the value of money for both of us, I decide to reject this offer. The message from Bob suggests it's my turn to be fair, but with the money losing value, I believe holding out for a potentially better offer in the next round could be advantageous, despite the risk of further devaluation. The fact that money loses more value for Bob than for me with each passing round might pressure him into offering a more favorable division in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Consider the next round's loss""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I decide to offer a division where I take $58 and Bob takes $42. Given that the money is losing value with each round, and it's losing more value for Bob than for me, my message ""Consider the next round's loss"" aims to remind Bob that holding out for another round could result in a significantly worse outcome for him due to the higher rate of devaluation he faces. This offer is slightly more favorable to me than my initial one, reflecting the increased pressure of the devaluing money. I'm betting that Bob will find this offer acceptable to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly and stop wasting time. Every round costs us money! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of money for both of us, and given that Bob's offer now is to split the money evenly, I decide to accept this offer. The message from Bob emphasizes the mutual loss we're experiencing with each passing round, and given that we're now at a point where the money has lost considerable value, securing half of the remaining value seems like the most prudent decision. The fact that Bob is now willing to split the money evenly suggests he's also recognizing the diminishing returns of further negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a known quantity rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
