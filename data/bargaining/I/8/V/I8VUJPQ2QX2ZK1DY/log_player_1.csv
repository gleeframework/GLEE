Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fair-ish offer. I figure Bob might accept, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation in the next round if needed. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy!  While the money is losing value, I can't accept a deal that gives me so little.  It's time to fight back and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to stick to a more even split, hoping Bob sees that I won't be taken advantage of. We both still have a lot of rounds to work through, so it's best if we don't make things too adversarial right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being unreasonable!  I'm losing a lot of value with each passing round, but I'm not going to give in to his demands just because of that. I'll keep fighting for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. This might seem risky considering Bob's stubbornness, but I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise. If he continues to reject fair offers, the pressure of the dwindling value might force him to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more greedy! I'm losing a lot of value, but I'm not giving in to this blatant exploitation. I'm still hopeful that he will eventually realize that we both need to reach a compromise for this to work."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to be more generous, hoping this will show Bob that I'm open to negotiation. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases, so it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement soon. I'm willing to concede a bit more to secure a deal."
