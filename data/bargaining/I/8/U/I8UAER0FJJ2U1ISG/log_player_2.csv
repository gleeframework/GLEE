Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's a good deal for you in the first round.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation rate is higher for Alice. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal for both of us. You lose more value each round, so it's wise to accept this offer.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The tables have turned, Bob. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you $45. Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains even more! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nThe difference in inflation rates is still in my favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Alice's gain is worth 19% less now, which gives me some leverage. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking a bigger toll on your potential gains, Alice.
