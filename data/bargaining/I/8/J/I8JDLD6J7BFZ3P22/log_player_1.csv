"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly more generous offer from me! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the new values are:

* My gain: $3,000 (5% less than $3,150)
* Bob's gain: $6,300 (10% less than $7,000)

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
