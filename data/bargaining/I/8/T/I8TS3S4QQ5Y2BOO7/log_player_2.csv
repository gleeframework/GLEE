Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  60/40 is a bit lopsided, and I think I can do better.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I came down a little bit, but we're running out of time, and I need you to meet me closer to my initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still proposing a very uneven split, and even though time is running out, I'm not going to give in to pressure tactics. I'm hoping she'll come down further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution.""}
