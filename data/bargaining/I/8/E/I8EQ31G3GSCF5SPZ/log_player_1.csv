"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. We both get a good amount, and it's better than risking further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still cautious about inflation. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800, which is a bit more than his previous offer, and keeping $4,200 for myself."
