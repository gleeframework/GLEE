"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","My proposal from Round 1 is now worth less due to inflation, and Bob's offer from Round 2 is also worth less.

I will accept Bob's offer from Round 2:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
