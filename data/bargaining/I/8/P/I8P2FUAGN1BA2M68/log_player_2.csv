"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm starting us off with a generous offer. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the value of money decreases with each round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting us both, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but let's be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. The inflation is indeed affecting the value of the money, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Alice is also losing value with each round, she might be more willing to compromise in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering we're both losing value, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly, but I still believe I deserve a larger share.""}"
