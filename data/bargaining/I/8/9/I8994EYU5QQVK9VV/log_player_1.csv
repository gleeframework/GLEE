"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and then we can re-evaluate the division in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this round, but don't think this is the final offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful with the numbers.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer just yet. I'd like to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect still in play, my offer for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this round. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal, while still being mindful of the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a bit more this round. Don't expect it to get better from here! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect taking a bigger toll on the money's value, I need to be even more strategic. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, especially since Bob is not budging much. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect really taking hold, my offer for round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3300,
  ""bob_gain"": 6700,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up much more. Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not going to go any lower.""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money and making a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, so I'll make a final push. This is my last offer - take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect really taking a toll on the money's value, I'm feeling the pressure. Considering Bob's final offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round, and the decreasing value of the money is making it harder to justify holding out. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get."
