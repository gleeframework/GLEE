"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest and simplest solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the amounts are now:

* Alice's gain: 720,000
* Bob's gain: 720,000

I'm not sure if this is the best I can do, but I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
