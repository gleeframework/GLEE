"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money upfront!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less and less each round. I'll have to be strategic.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially with the money being worth less each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. With the money being worth less each round, I'll aim for a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly now! I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept a smaller share than I offered in round 3, especially since the money is worth less and less each round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer again, taking into account the accelerating inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm hoping to get a bigger share of the remaining money before it's worth even less."
