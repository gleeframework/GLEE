"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000, and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

For Round 2, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider the equivalent value in Round 1 terms.

In Round 1, $400,000 would have been worth $500,000 in today's money, and $600,000 would have been worth $750,000.

Considering the values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","For Round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation. Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering you $100,000, and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

For Round 4, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In Round 1, $650,000 would have been worth $812,500 in today's money, and $350,000 would have been worth $437,500.

Considering the values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
