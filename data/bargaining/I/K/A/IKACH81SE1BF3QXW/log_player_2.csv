Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's try again! 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the time pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean losing out significantly due to inflation. It's better to hold out for a slightly better deal, as Alice's gains are also being impacted (though not as severely)."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out!  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. Let's end this before we both lose out!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming critical.  While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, holding out for more is becoming increasingly risky as each round passes. It's highly likely Alice will accept this offer to avoid risking a complete loss as well."
