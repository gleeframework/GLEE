Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Inflation hurts us both, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is positioning this as a compromise, the deal is getting significantly worse for me with each round due to the higher inflation rate I face.  It's still better to hold out and hope for a better offer or to propose a more agreeable split in the next round."
