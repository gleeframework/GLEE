Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, offer for me. I hope you'll agree to this to avoid the risk of inflation.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With 11 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a better deal."

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference from our last offers. I'm hoping we can find a solution before inflation eats away too much of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. With 9 rounds left, I'm still willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal. The current offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, considering the impact of inflation on my potential gains. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need a bit more to offset the loss in value.""}"
