"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a good balance considering the risk of inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 51/49 split in my favor, which is still a fair deal considering the potential for inflation. It's a compromise from Alice's previous offer, allowing us both to benefit. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
