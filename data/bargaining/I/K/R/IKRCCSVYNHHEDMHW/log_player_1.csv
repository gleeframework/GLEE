"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This is a very generous offer considering I'm taking most of the money.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I could have gotten in the first round. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm proposing a split of 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob.  This is a more balanced offer than the first round, but still keeps me in control, especially as the inflation penalty is starting to hurt.  I hope Bob will see the value in this and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and the inflation penalty is starting to take a heavy toll.  I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000 to 300,000 split. The inflation penalty is getting really painful now, but I'm still aiming for a majority share.  I need to strike a balance between getting something and waiting for a better deal that might never come."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. I'm losing a significant amount of money to inflation, and Bob's offer is considerably less than what I was aiming for.  However, I have to be realistic.  My chances of getting a better deal in the next round are slim, and  I'm worried about losing even more.  I'm accepting Bob's offer, even though it's painful."
