That's not a fair deal for me, Bob.  Alice is trying to take advantage early on. Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it more even. This is my counter-offer.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were generous, now it's my turn. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to take a bigger slice of the pie. While she moved closer to the middle, it's not enough. The inflation is working in my favor, so she'll likely be more open to a better deal for me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice.  This is a fair split, and the inflation is only getting worse for you.""}"

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's only moved up 10k. I need to hold firm and make it clear that a near-even split is the best she'll get."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
