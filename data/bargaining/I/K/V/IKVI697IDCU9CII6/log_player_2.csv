"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is unfair. While she claims to be ""taking a bit more,"" she's actually taking a significantly larger share. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""How about a slightly more even split this time? We can both benefit from ending the game now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is moving closer to a more even split, and the effects of inflation are starting to become more significant. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable amount, even if it's not the absolute best I could have gotten."
