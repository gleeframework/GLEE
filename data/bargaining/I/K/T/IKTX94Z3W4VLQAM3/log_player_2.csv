"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation affecting me more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's not fair to start with such a lopsided division, especially considering the inflation advantage Alice has. I'll try to get a more even share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  We both have to consider inflation, so a 50/50 split seems like the best way to ensure we both get something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out!  My offer is still better than what we'll both get with continued inflation.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than the previous round, it's still not a fair split. I'm willing to gamble on a more equitable division in the next round.  I believe we can find a solution that benefits us both more than this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground.  I'm offering a split that's closer to 50/50 while still acknowledging the impact of inflation on both of us.  Let's reach an agreement before the money is worth even less.""}
