**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now. While her offer is closer to a potential agreement, I believe waiting one more round will push her to make a deal more favorable to me."

**Reasoning:**

The tide has turned. Alice is now offering me more than half the money due to the significant impact of inflation on her returns. It's in my best interest to accept this offer now before she potentially offers even less in future rounds."
