"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'm not ready to settle yet. Let's keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, considering the inflation is affecting Bob's money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. Consider this a fair offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not so far apart. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can agree on this one. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, Bob's offer is looking more appealing. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise.
