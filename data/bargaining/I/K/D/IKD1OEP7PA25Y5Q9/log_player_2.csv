This offer is ludicrously unfair. Even though the money is worth less in the next round, it's worth fighting for a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I'm not going to let you take everything.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a bigger share. Let's split it 60/40.  
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still not fair. I'm confident I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the difference. This is my final offer.""}
