"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10, and I'll take $90. I'm being generous, but I'm also trying to set a tone for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, and I'll take $70. I'm trying to find a balance between being reasonable and pushing for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking again.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Splitting it down the middle seems fair, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with the money continuing to lose value.
