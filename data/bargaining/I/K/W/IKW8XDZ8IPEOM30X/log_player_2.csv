"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! This offer benefits us both, but time is money, especially for you Bob. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While getting something is better than nothing, the declining value of the money makes it worth holding out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. This offer is much fairer. Let's close the deal and not lose more value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to take advantage of my larger inflation rate, but this offer is barely better than her first one.  I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking another round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}
```"
