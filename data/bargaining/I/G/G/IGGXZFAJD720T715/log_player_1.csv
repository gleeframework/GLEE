"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed later.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and we can reassess as we go along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to start with this as a baseline. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not getting as much as I would have in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'm keeping an eye on the value of the money and hoping to do better in future rounds.
