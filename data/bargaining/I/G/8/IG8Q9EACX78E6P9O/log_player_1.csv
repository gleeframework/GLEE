Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, considering the inflation we both face.  Let's end this game and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nMy message to Bob: Your offer is still not fair, considering I lose more value to inflation. I'll make a counteroffer next round.\n\nMy next offer: Alice gain: 550000, Bob gain: 450000\n\nMessage: This is a more balanced split, taking into account the uneven inflation impact. Let's settle this!"
