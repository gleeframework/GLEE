"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a 60% share of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still think in terms of the original $1,000,000. However, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I need to take that into account.

My current gain is $600,000, and Bob's current gain is $630,000 (70% of $900,000). This is a better offer for me than the previous one, so I accept.
