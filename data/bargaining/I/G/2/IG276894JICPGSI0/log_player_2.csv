Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time. I'm not interested in haggling any further.  A 50/50 split is the fairest solution, especially considering the impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
