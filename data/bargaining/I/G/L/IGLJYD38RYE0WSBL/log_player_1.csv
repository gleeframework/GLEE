"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 6,000 and Bob 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to negotiate too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual value of the proposed gains. Bob's offer would give me 5,000, which is equivalent to 4,000 in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me 5,500 and Bob 4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a big toll on my gains!

I'll consider Bob's offer. If I accept, I'll get 5,200, which is equivalent to about 4,000 in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll think about it for a moment... Ah, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. It's not perfect, but it's better than going back to the negotiating table.
