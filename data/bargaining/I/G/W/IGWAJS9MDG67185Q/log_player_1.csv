"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message to Bob that we should aim for a fair division. Since the money loses value over time, especially for me, I'm trying to get a bit more than half to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and possibly end the game early.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer to split the money evenly because, considering the inflation, an even split now is not as favorable to me as it would have been in the first round. Given that the money is worth 20% less to me and only 10% less to Bob, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round or make an offer that compensates for the loss in value. Plus, with 10 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate without losing everything to inflation.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my proposed share to 58% and decreasing Bob's share to 42%, with a message explaining that this adjustment is due to the inflation affecting us differently. Since the money continues to lose value, especially for me at a higher rate, I'm trying to secure a bit more to compensate for this loss. The message aims to justify this adjustment as a fair consideration of the game's mechanics, hoping Bob might see the reason in it and accept, ending the game before the money loses even more value.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55/45. Inflation is hurting us both, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 55-45 split in his favor because, despite his message suggesting it as a fair compromise due to inflation, the split doesn't adequately compensate me for the significantly higher loss in value I'm experiencing. Given that the money is now worth 48.8% less to me compared to the first round, while it's only 27.1% less valuable to Bob, accepting this offer would put me at a considerable disadvantage. With several rounds still to go, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more equitable agreement that takes into account the disproportionate impact of inflation on my potential gain.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation hits me harder, let's balance it!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message explaining that due to the inflation affecting me more significantly, this division is necessary to balance out the loss in value. Since the money is now worth nearly half as much to me as it was initially, while Bob's loss, although significant, is less severe, I'm trying to secure a larger share to make up for this disparity. The message aims to convey that this proposal is not merely a greedy ask but a necessary adjustment to the differing impacts of inflation on our potential gains, hoping Bob will understand the reasoning and accept the offer before further devaluation.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's try 60/40 to keep the game going. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 60-40 split in his favor because, despite the acknowledgment that both of us are losing money, the proposed split does not adequately address the significantly greater loss in value I'm experiencing due to inflation. With the money now worth 67.23% less to me than in the first round, and only 40.95% less to Bob, accepting this offer would be highly disadvantageous. Given the substantial difference in how inflation is affecting us, I believe there's still room for negotiation to find a more equitable division that considers the disproportionate impact on my potential gain. With several rounds left, I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a better deal.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation gap is growing, let's adjust accordingly!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm proposing a 62-38 split in my favor, with a message highlighting that the gap in how inflation affects us is growing. Given that the money is now worth over 67% less to me than initially, and about 41% less to Bob, I believe this division is necessary to compensate for the increasingly disparate impact of inflation on our potential gains. The message aims to convey the urgency of finding an agreement that takes this growing gap into account, hoping Bob will recognize the need for an adjusted split and accept the offer before the value of the money drops even further.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time. I'm willing to go for 65/35 to try and get something before it's all gone. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 65-35 split in his favor because, despite the urgency of the situation with the money losing significant value and the game nearing its end, the proposed split is too skewed in Bob's favor. Given that the money is now worth nearly 80% less to me than initially, and about 52% less to Bob, accepting this offer would mean I end up with a very small amount of value compared to what was initially at stake. With a few rounds still left, I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better deal, hoping to find a split that more equitably reflects the impact of inflation on both of us.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor, with a message emphasizing that this is likely our last chance to reach a fair agreement before the money loses all its value or the game ends. Given the significant impact of inflation, particularly on my potential gain, I believe this division is necessary to compensate for the loss in value. By framing it as a ""last chance,"" I'm hoping to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing if we fail to agree in the remaining rounds.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We are down to the wire. Let's try 70/30 and hope it's enough to avoid getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 70-30 split in his favor because, even with the game nearing its end and the risk of getting nothing, the proposed split remains too skewed in Bob's favor. Given the extreme devaluation of the money for me (86.58% less than initially) and the significant but lesser devaluation for Bob (61.26% less), accepting this offer would be highly disadvantageous. With two rounds still left, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations to find a more equitable division, recognizing that any agreement now would be better than the alternative of both of us walking away with nothing.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Final push for fairness!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with a message that frames this as a final attempt to reach a fair agreement. Given the extreme impact of inflation on my potential gain, I believe this division is necessary to compensate for the loss in value. By emphasizing that this is a ""final push,"" I'm hoping to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing if we fail to agree in the last round.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is our last chance. I'm willing to take a big risk, but I think 75/25 is the best shot we have to get something. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer of a 75-25 split in his favor because we are down to the last round and the risk of getting nothing is too high. Given the extreme devaluation of the money for both of us, but especially for me (91.41% less than initially), even a 25% share of the significantly devalued amount is better than walking away with nothing. It's clear that neither of us wants to end the game without any gain, and this offer, although not favorable, is the last opportunity to salvage something from the negotiations.\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
