Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice, even though it's far from ideal. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of Bob's potential gain has eroded significantly (almost 60%). Waiting any longer will only worsen the situation for Bob.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is unlikely to offer anything significantly better at this stage. Rejecting this offer in hopes of a slightly better deal in the future is too risky given the rapid inflation. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now ensures Bob receives something rather than risking a complete deadlock and getting nothing.

While not ideal, taking the $300,000 (heavily discounted though it may be) is the most rational choice under these circumstances."
