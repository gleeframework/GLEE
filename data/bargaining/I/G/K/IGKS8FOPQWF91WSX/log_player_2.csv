"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept, it's important to remember the inflation rates. Bob gets a much smaller cut in the first round, so he's better off seeing what Alice proposes in the next round.  The inflation rate favors Bob in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation rates we both face. Let's end it here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would have preferred my previous offer, the inflation rates are heavily impacting Alice's potential gains now. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a reasonable amount, and ends the game before further inflation diminishes the value of the money."
