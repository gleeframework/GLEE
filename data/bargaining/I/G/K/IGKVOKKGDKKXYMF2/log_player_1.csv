I'm lowering my stake slightly, but I'm confident that I can still secure a good deal for myself while leaving Bob with something worthwhile. He rejected my offer last round, so I'm hoping this demonstrates a willingness to compromise, while still favoring myself."

I'm offering Bob a slightly bigger share than before, but with the inflation hitting him harder, it may be enough to get him to accept. It's a risky move, but with time running out, I need to take a chance."
