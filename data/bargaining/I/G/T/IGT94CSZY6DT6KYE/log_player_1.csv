"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight bias towards me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation and get a larger share of the money. I'm not willing to accept this offer, especially since I'm not getting a good deal. I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, where I'm not giving up too much, but still willing to compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
