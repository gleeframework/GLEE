"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering inflation, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
