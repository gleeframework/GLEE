Let's see how Bob responds!  I'm confident he'll see the wisdom in my generous offer. ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept a deal where I get so much less than what I proposed! I'll take my chances with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

Bob, let's be reasonable here.  While inflation has hurt me a bit, I'm still willing to offer a fair deal. This is a compromise, and I believe it's in our best interests to end this game."
