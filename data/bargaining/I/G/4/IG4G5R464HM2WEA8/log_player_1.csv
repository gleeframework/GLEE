"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $50. This is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good opportunity for Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, it's a good start 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it.

Since I'm getting 40, it's worth $38.20 (100 - 5% = 95, so 40 x 0.95 = 38.20) to me due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share than before. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I need a bigger piece of the pie 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting hard now!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split. However, I'll calculate the actual value of the 30 I'd get:

30 x 0.85 (95% of the original value due to inflation) = $25.50

It's not a great offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain now!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'm not thrilled about the 20/80 split. However, I'll calculate the actual value of the 20 I'd get:

20 x 0.77 (100% - 22.62% = 77.38% of the original value due to inflation) = $15.40

It's a very small consolation, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.
