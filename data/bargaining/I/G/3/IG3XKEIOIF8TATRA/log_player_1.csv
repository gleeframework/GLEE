"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob!

I'll think about it for a moment... I'd like to get a bit more, but I don't want to risk going into negative territory if the game goes on too long. I'll accept your offer for now.
