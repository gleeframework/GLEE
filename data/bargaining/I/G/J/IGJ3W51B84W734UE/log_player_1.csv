"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get some money now rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds."
