Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we both have to deal with. Let's end this here! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Calculate the adjusted value of money for both Alice and Bob due to inflation.
For Alice, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and for Bob, it's worth 10% less. Since we are now in Round 3, we need to calculate the adjusted value of the money for both players. However, the specific question asks for the offer without explicitly requiring the calculation of the adjusted values due to inflation for this step. The key is understanding that the total amount to be divided remains $1,000,000, but its value is perceived differently by each player due to inflation.

### Step 2: Consider the previous offers and adjust the strategy.
In Round 1, Alice offered Bob $400,000, which was rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered Alice $450,000, which was also rejected. Given the trend and the impact of inflation, Alice needs to adjust her strategy to either meet Bob closer to his offer or provide a compelling reason for Bob to accept her new offer.

### Step 3: Formulate a new offer considering the game's dynamics and the goal to maximize gain.
Given the rejection of previous offers and the pressure of inflation, Alice needs to balance between maximizing her gain and making an offer that Bob might find acceptable. Considering Bob's last offer and the fact that Alice rejected $450,000, Alice might need to offer Bob a slightly better deal than before but still aim to maximize her share.

### Step 4: Create the offer in the required JSON format.
Alice decides to offer herself $525,000 and Bob $475,000, hoping that this division will be seen as more equitable by Bob, considering the decreasing value of money for both.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway considering inflation.""}"
