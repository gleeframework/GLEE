"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly.  A 90/10 split seems fair to me given the inflation disadvantage you face. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While a 90/10 split seems generous, it's still quite lopsided. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  A 50/50 split seems like the most equitable way to divide the money, considering the inflation we'll both face in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but the inflation puts you at a bigger disadvantage with each round.  I'll take a little less than last time, and you'll still get a good chunk before it devalues further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than the first round, it still feels too unfair considering the rapid devaluation. I'm hoping for a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation is a big factor, but I believe a 40/60 split is a fairer compromise.  It allows you to get a good amount, while giving me a chance to recover some of my losses before the money becomes even less valuable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  This offer lets you walk away with more than you'd get if you reject and I have to make the final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is really hurting me. Taking this offer will give me a decent amount, and I'm concerned that if I reject, Alice might offer me an even worse deal in the next round.  It's time to cut my losses."
