"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $80 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $64.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I think I can do better. I'll wait for your next offer.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my previous $64 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $51.20.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a bit more for myself.""
}
```"
