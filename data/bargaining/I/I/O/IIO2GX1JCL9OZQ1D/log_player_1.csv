"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800
Bob gain: 4000 * 0.95 = 3800

I'll accept this offer.
