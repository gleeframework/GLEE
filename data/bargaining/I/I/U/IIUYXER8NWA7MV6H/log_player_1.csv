"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving $300,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping a decent chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my calculation is:

My gain: $600,000 / 0.8 = $750,000
Bob's gain: $400,000 / 0.95 = $421,053

Considering the offer, I'll accept this one. The message was friendly, and the offer is a bit better than my initial one.
