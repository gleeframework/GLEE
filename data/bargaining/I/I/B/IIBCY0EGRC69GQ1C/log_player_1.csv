"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a very simple split: 900,000 for me, 100,000 for Bob. This is a very fair and balanced offer, and I hope Bob will see that. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, and I'm not going to accept it.  Even with the inflation, 300,000 is too low for me. I'm going to make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 400,000 and take 600,000 for myself. This is a fairer split than Bob's offer, considering the inflation. Let's see if he's willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is getting serious.  450,000 is better than nothing, and I don't want to risk losing everything. I'll accept Bob's offer."
