"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept.  It's risky, but it leaves me with more if he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. It's very unfavorable, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. While the inflation is hurting my potential gains, I think I can still get more than 10."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer for myself this time, hoping Bob is willing to compromise. He rejected a very favorable offer last round, so I'm hoping he's starting to see the value in getting something at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is really starting to hurt, I'm still going to reject this offer. Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.  We have a few more rounds before the money becomes worthless, so I'm not giving in yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer again. I'm hoping Bob is starting to see the value in making a deal, as the inflation is hurting both of us. I need to be more flexible to secure some of the money before it's all gone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer, even though the inflation is making the money less valuable.  I need to hold out for a better deal. We're approaching the middle of the game, and there's still time for both of us to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a more balanced split.  We're getting close to the end, and I need to make sure we reach an agreement. The inflation is really starting to eat away at the value, so I need to act now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. The inflation is really starting to impact the value of the money, and I'm worried we'll run out of time. Accepting this offer isn't ideal, but it's better than getting nothing. I need to be realistic and secure some of the money while I can."
