"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $300,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob taking a 7/10 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not too much!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant portion for myself."

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $250,000 is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately $214,000.

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than 50% of the initial amount, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not sure if it's a fair deal.

I'll reject the offer.
