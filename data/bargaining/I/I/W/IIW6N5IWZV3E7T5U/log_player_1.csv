"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: 300,000 / 0.8 = 375,000
Bob gain: 700,000 / 0.8 = 875,000

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than the first one. I'll accept this offer.
