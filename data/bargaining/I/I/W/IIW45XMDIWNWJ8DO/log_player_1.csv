"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a fair compromise at all! Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I made the first proposal and didn't get a good deal. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him 700,000 and only 300,000 to me. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give away too much. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm trying to find a balance between my initial 50/50 proposal and Bob's aggressive offer. I'm willing to give him a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding on to a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to accept less than 60% of the total. You're getting a good deal, but I'm the one taking the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob 60% of the total. I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation. I'm not willing to give away 40% of the total, especially since I'm still holding on to a decent amount. I'll reject this offer and try to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not willing to give away too much. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.""}

I'm trying to find a balance between my previous offers and Bob's demands. I'm willing to give him a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding on to a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping that this offer will be more acceptable to Bob."
