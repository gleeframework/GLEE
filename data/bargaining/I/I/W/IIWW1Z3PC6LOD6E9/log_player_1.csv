"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to keep $99 for myself and give Bob $1.  It's a big disparity, but I'm hoping he'll take it to avoid getting nothing in the end.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair and equal split. I'd rather take $50 now than risk getting nothing later.  Let's end this game!"
