"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm offering Bob a significant amount upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer now that Bob has made a move.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This offer is a bit more one-sided, but I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is decreasing in value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a bit more generous than it seems, since the money he's offering is worth less due to inflation.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, since I'm not sure how much Bob's gain is worth to him. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make another offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500
}
```

This offer is quite aggressive, but I'm trying to maximize my gain given the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a more equal split now that the money is worth significantly less.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split and I don't want to risk losing out on a fair share of the remaining money.
