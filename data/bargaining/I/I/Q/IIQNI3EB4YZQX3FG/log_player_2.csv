"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 3:1 ratio might seem tempting, the risk of inflation is too high. It's better to secure a gain now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
