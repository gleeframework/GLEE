"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point.  Let's see if we can agree on something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's go with a 70/30 split.  This is a good deal for both of us with the inflation taken into account. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a better deal, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. With inflation, the money is losing value quickly.  Let's take the 30% and move on."
