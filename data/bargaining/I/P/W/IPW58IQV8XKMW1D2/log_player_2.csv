"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage I have. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Your starting offer was a bit imbalanced. I'm proposing a more equitable split, especially considering the inflation will affect you more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the inflation, but I still need a larger share to make it fair. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor considering the rapid inflation working against her. I need to push for a more significant shift in my favor before the shrinking pot makes it irrelevant."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer: a perfectly even split. It's the fairest option considering the inflation, and ensures we both benefit significantly. Let's end this before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a point where this isn't worth it for either of us. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need you to meet me halfway. This offer is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The rapidly increasing inflation is becoming a serious concern. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk ending up with nothing.  Alice seems firm in her position, and waiting any longer could lead to even less favorable offers or reaching the deadline with no agreement."
