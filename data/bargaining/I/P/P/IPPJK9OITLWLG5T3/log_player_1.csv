"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50 dollars in this round is actually worth less than my gain of 60 dollars in the previous round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

I'm offering you 60 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 40 dollars."
