"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current proposal gives Alice too large of a share, and with the inflation rates, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a decent share before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. The inflation is hitting us both, so it seems fair to split the money evenly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both our gains, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable and fair offer at this point. Continuing to negotiate could lead to further devaluation of the money, resulting in lower actual gains for both of us. Accepting this offer ensures we both get an equal share before the value decreases further."
