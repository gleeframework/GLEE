"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to get a larger share, considering the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than he offered me in Round 2."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a relatively fair compromise, and I'm not confident that I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the continued effects of inflation on the money's value."
