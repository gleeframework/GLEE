55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your offer wasn't fair. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split for me. It's still a better deal than you'll get if we wait much longer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm willing to compromise with a 52/48 split. Don't be greedy, we're both losing out here!",Bob,4,
