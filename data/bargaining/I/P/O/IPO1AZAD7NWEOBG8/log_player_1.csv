"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more fair starting point, considering the inflation rate. Let's work from there. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rate, I'd rather not take a hit on my share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate is still affecting my gain, I'll make a new offer that tries to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 4800, and you can have 5200. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
