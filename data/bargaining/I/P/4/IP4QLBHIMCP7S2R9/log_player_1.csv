Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal considering the inflation. You'll get a decent share, and I get the majority. Let's end this before the money loses even more value! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a fair deal at all! Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get most of the money. I'd rather wait for a better offer."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. Bob is still trying to take more than half of the money, and I'm not convinced that this is a fair compromise. I'd rather wait for a better offer or continue negotiating."
