"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start, but I'll try to negotiate more in future rounds! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob and I want more than 4000!  I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, given the inflation you'll face. Let's end this round and move on to bigger and better things!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to make up for the inflation, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Even though the offer isn't perfect, I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  Plus, Alice is starting to lose a lot more money to inflation.  I'll take it!"
