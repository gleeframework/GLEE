Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and your share is shrinking.  This is a fair deal, let's not drag this out. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but your procrastination is costing you.  Take this offer before it depreciates further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting worse, accepting now would mean accepting less than half of the initial amount. There's still time to negotiate, and Alice knows my position on a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my previous offer. 50/50 is the only fair outcome here.  I'm willing to risk it all for a fair deal. Are you?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

Sticking with the 50/50 split sends a strong message to Alice about Bob's resolve.  By emphasizing his willingness to walk away, Bob might pressure Alice to accept before the decreasing value makes it impossible for him to make a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think you enjoy wasting time.  This is a compromise.  Take it before you regret it even more. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 7 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains. Waiting any longer significantly risks getting an even smaller share, even if Alice eventually agrees to a 50/50 split.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently rejected Bob's 50/50 offers and is unlikely to budge.  Her offers are getting progressively worse, indicating she is willing to play the long game.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer carries a significant risk of walking away with nothing. Accepting the current offer guarantees a reasonable sum, albeit less than initially hoped for. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes the smartest move is to cut losses and secure a reasonable gain rather than gamble on an increasingly improbable ideal outcome."
