"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's not a fair deal considering the inflation working against you. This offer still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the clock is ticking and inflation is hurting me more than her.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking a lower amount later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm feeling the inflation pinch! This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure we both face.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I've increased my offer slightly to entice Alice while still aiming for a larger share. Highlighting the time pressure and inflation emphasizes the need for her to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it's a good deal for you considering the rapid inflation. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and clearly signaled this is her final offer.  While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a payout.  Rejecting it means risking a much lower amount, potentially nothing, as we are now past the halfway point of the rounds and inflation is quickly eroding the value."
