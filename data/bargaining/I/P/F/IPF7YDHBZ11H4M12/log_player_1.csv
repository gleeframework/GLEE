"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a classic ultimatum game scenario. While Bob could technically reject this offer, it's highly unlikely he'd want to risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is much better than the previous one, it's still not ideal.  Since the money I gain is not affected by inflation, I can afford to be greedy and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a large majority of the money.  Bob is now facing a much higher risk of getting nothing if he continues to reject offers."
