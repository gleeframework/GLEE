"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money in a 70/30 ratio, with you receiving $3000. I believe this is fair given the inflation rate and the diminishing value of future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to compromise and offer you a slightly lower amount to avoid further rounds and the impact of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
