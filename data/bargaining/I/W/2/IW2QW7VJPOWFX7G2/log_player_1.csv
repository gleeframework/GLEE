"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering you $4500, which is still a good deal for you, and I'll take the remaining $5500. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
