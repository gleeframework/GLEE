Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 90$ for myself and give Bob 10$. I believe this is a fair offer since I am taking on the risk of Bob rejecting it and potentially losing more money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
