"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take a more cautious approach this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 80-20 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept this more moderate proposal."
