"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob, but I think I deserve a bit more for going first. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 30 dollars is something, it's a pretty low starting point, and I'm sure I can do better if I get to propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we both get something good.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again.  I'll be a little more generous this time, but this deal gets worse for both of us the longer we wait! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is slightly better, I still believe I can get a more equitable split.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This money is losing value quickly.  I'm offering a fair split, but I'm not willing to go lower than this.  It's time to compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is still better than what this money will be worth in another round or two! Take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the money is getting less valuable, I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation is affecting Alice more than it's affecting me, so I believe she'll come back with a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to give you 40%  but this is my final offer. Take it or we both get nothing in the end.""}
```"
