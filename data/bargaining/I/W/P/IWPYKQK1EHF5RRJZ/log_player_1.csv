```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! You'll get more with me!""

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can end the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.

I'll reject the offer for now. My current gain of $8,000 is still a significant amount, and I'd like to try to get more.

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final stand, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.

I'll reject the offer for now. My current gain of $8,000 is still a significant amount, and I'd like to try to get more. I'm not convinced that a 40/60 split is fair, considering the inflation and the fact that the money is decreasing in value.

}
```

# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final push for a compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.

Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is actually quite reasonable. I'd be getting a significant amount, and Bob would be getting a decent amount as well.

I'll accept the offer.
