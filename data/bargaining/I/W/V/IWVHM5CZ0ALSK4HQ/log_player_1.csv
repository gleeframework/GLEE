"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I rejected your offer.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob is trying to take advantage of the rejection by proposing a 60-40 split in his favor. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's split the money 50-50 and end this game.""}

I'm reducing my initial offer to account for the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my first proposal. I'm hoping that a 50-50 split will be more appealing to Bob."
