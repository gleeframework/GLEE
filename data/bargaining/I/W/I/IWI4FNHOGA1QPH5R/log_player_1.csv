"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair deal?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 55-45 is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a better offer than the 60-40 I initially proposed. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
