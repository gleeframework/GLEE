"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, and split the money evenly. There's no need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money I gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Since Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, I'll calculate my gain as follows:

* Initial $100 / 2 = $50
* With 20% inflation, my gain is worth 80% of $50, which is $40

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
