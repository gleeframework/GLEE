It's better to see if I can get a better deal. Even though the offer is fair, I have 12 rounds to try and get more!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is slightly better for me than my previous offer, and considering the inflation, it's likely that I won't get a better deal in the following rounds."
