"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and simple starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about the proposal. However, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to meet me in the middle, which is a good sign.

Considering the current value of the money, I think I can live with Bob's offer. I'll accept his proposal for now.
