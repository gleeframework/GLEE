"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. That way, we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer and the situation:

* **Bob's Offer:** He's proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair on the surface.
* **Inflation Impact:** While the money is losing value for both of us, Bob is affected more significantly with each round. This means time is on my side to a certain extent.
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject, I get to make the offer in the next round. I can leverage the inflation factor to my advantage.

**Decision:**

While Bob's offer isn't terrible, I believe I can get a slightly better deal by leveraging the inflation factor.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This accounts for some inflation, but still a decent deal for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Inflation:**  Bob's money is now worth 10% less than in round 1, giving me more bargaining power.
* **Compromise:** I'm shifting my offer slightly towards a more even split to incentivize Bob to accept. 
* **Urgency:** With each round, the potential gains for both of us decrease. This offer keeps a decent chunk of the money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to split it evenly again.  Inflation is impacting us both, but this way we're both sure to get something worthwhile. Let's end this game before we both lose money! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's break down the situation:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're now in Round 4 with 8 rounds remaining. The clock is ticking, and the risk of walking away with nothing increases.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixated on the 50/50 split. This might be his bottom line.
* **Inflation Impact:** While true that inflation impacts us both, Bob is feeling the heat far more than I am. 

**Decision:**

This is a tough one. While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal in the next round or two, Bob's offer isn't terrible.  There's a real risk he digs in his heels, and we both lose out as the money loses value. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm choosing a safer route here. Accepting a sure $5000 now outweighs the risk of ending up with nothing if negotiations drag on and the money continues to depreciate."
