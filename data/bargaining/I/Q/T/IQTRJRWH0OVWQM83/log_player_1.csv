  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take the rest.""
}

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and gives Bob 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round, so $6,000 is now equivalent to $5,400. The money Bob gains is worth 20% less, so $4,000 is now equivalent to $3,200.

Bob's new offer is:
Alice gain: $4,500
Bob gain: $5,500

This is a more favorable offer for me, but I still think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up too much.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit more aggressive, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values considering the inflation:

Initially, the money was worth $10,000. After 3 rounds, the money is worth 0.7^3 = 0.343 (70% of the original value) for me, and 0.8^3 = 0.512 (51.2% of the original value) for Bob.

So, the money I gain is worth 0.343 * $6,000 = $2,058, and the money Bob gains is worth 0.512 * $4,000 = $2,048.

Bob's new offer is:
Alice gain: $3,500
Bob gain: $6,500
