Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly aggressive offer in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share right away.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and with the inflation factor in play, I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the future.  Let's take the 50/50 split and move on."
