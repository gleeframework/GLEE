"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when making my decision.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob's offer is the same as mine in Round 3, but with the money values adjusted for inflation. I'll think carefully about it...

After considering the offer, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
