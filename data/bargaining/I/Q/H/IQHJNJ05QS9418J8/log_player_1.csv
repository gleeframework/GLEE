"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's structure. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me taking the larger share this time.  Let's see if you accept. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to mirror my previous offer. I'm not interested in that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the money's value by 20% again, so my gain is worth even less now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to flip the script, but I'm not buying it. My turn now.""
}
```

I'm making a new offer, with a larger share going to Bob this time. Let's see if he accepts!"
