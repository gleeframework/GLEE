"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations now.

I reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gain!

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer, as I don't want to risk losing even more value with each passing round."
