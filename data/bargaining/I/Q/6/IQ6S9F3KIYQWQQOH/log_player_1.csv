"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to be reasonable and accept the offer. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'm hoping he'll be motivated to accept this offer rather than risking a lower value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the money is worth less to me each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, his 60-40 split in his favor is actually more like a 60-36 split in value, given that his $6000 is worth 10% less than in the first round. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Consider the decreasing value, this is a good deal""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 65-35 split in my favor. Given that the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, his $3500 in this round is actually equivalent in value to the $4000 I offered him in the first round. I'm highlighting this point in my message, emphasizing that considering the decreasing value of the money to him, this is a good deal for both of us."
