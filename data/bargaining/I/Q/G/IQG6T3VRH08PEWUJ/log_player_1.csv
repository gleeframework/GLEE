"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a little better than a 50/50 split.  How about I take 60% and you take 40%? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but I'm not going to give up yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the second round, which is 10% of 10% less than the original, so it's 90% of 90% of $10,000 = $7290.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Can we try 45/55?""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still hoping to get a better deal."
