"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment... 

I'll accept this offer.
