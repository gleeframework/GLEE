Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, Alice. I'm offering you $4,500, and I'll take $5,500.  We both get a good share, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
