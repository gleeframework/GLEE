"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and leaves Bob with $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my decision accordingly. I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
