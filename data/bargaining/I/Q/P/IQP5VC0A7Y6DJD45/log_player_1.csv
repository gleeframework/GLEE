"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my share, now it's my turn to be cautious. I'll offer you a more modest share, but still a fair one, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
