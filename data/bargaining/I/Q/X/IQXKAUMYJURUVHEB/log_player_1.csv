"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, I get a bit more""}\n\nHow is that? I made an offer where I get $60 and Bob gets $40, with a message suggesting it's a fair division. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly.  Let's each take 60,  so we can both get more than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see what Bob's trying to do. Obviously, we can't both take $60 since that would be $120, which is more than the $100 we're dividing.

Given the actual numbers, where I would get $40 and Bob would get $60, I don't think this is a better offer for me than my initial proposal. So, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'll take a bit less than before""}\n\nI've made a new offer where I get $55 and Bob gets $45, with a message suggesting we're meeting in the middle. I've reduced my share from the initial $60 to $55, hoping Bob will find this more acceptable. Let me know what Bob decides!"
