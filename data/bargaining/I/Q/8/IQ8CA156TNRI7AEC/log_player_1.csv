"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering 60 dollars to myself and 40 dollars to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. In the first round, I offered 60 dollars, which is worth 80% of what it was originally. So, in the second round, I'm effectively getting 0.8 * 60 = 48 dollars.

Considering Bob's offer of 45 dollars, I'm getting 45 dollars, which is more than what I would get in the second round. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer.
