"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate if he wants a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair, considering the money is losing value each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is losing value each round, I'd like to take a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation. Can you meet me at 6000?""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and counter-proposing that I get $6,000, which is a bit more than his original offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is losing value at a rate of 0% for me and 5% for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of Bob's share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 7,000 is a fair share for me, considering the inflation.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000, and Bob gets 30%."
