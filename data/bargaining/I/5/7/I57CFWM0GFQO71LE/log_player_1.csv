"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I figure it's a good starting point, giving me a good portion of the money while still leaving Bob with something.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair split and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the end."
