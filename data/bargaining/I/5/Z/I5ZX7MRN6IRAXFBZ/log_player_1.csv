"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 50/50.  I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm confident we can both come out ahead with this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by the inflation.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. This way, we can both benefit from the negotiation.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with a 55/45 ratio. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
