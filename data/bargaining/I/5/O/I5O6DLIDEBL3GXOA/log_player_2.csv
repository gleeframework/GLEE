Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  I think this is the fairest option considering the inflation and how things have gone so far. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the 5000. It's better than risking further inflation."
