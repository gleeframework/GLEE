Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round. Since we don't know the inflation rate, it's best to be aggressive and get as much as possible early on. I'm assuming Bob will reject this, but it sets a baseline for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation hurts Bob more, this is a fair offer. It's better to take the 500,000 now, rather than risk getting nothing in subsequent rounds."
