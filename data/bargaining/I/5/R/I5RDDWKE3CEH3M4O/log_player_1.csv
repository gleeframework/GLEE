"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure Bob might accept this in the first round to avoid the risk of getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair 50/50 split, and I would rather secure half the money now than risk getting less in future rounds."
