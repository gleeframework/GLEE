"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Fair share, let's be reasonable""
}
```

In this offer, I propose to take $550,000 for myself and leave $450,000 for Bob. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a fair division and that we should settle on this to avoid further rounds, which would decrease the value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""
}


I've taken into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's money is worth 20% less each round, while mine is only worth 5% less. I'm trying to use this to my advantage by offering Bob a slightly smaller share, while still trying to appear reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's settle this. I'll agree to your original split, it seems fair enough now considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
