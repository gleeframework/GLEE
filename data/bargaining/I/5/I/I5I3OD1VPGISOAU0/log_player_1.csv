"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fairly standard and reasonable division. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll get 50 * 0.9 = 45. Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'll get 50 * 0.95 = 47.5.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
