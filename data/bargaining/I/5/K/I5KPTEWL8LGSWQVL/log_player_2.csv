"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999

I'm not going to take a measly 1 dollar! Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair share, Alice. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This is a much fairer deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than getting nothing at all, especially with inflation hitting hard."
