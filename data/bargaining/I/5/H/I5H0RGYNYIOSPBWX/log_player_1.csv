"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000 and keep 6000 for myself. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm keeping a majority of the money for myself. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal later 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great deal for me! The money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 1800
* Bob gain: 7200

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too low for me. I'm looking for a more even split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still keeping a slight edge in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now!

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 1821.8
* Bob gain: 5447.2

I'll reject this offer as well. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still too low for me. I'm not budging yet.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need a bigger share. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a stronger stance and see if Bob will fold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth a lot less now!

Since the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000
* Bob gain: 3000

This is a 50-50 split, which is a pretty even deal. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, you got me. 50-50 it is.""
}
```"
