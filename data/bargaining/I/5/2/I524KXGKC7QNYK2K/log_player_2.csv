"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need the majority share.  This offer reflects the increasing value of time. Accept now and we both get something, or risk losing it all. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering more, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The 5% inflation means time is working against me more than her. I need to push for a more equitable split while it's still early in the game."
