"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this is a fair split considering the decreasing value of the money over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I know Alice's money is losing value much faster than mine. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more equitable split that reflects the faster depreciation of your money. Let's end this quickly and fairly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's meet in the middle to avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a slightly higher share, Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation. Accepting will avoid further losses due to the decreasing value of the money."
