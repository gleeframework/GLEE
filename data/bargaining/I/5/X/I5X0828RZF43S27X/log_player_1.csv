"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the original $10,000. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this round 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
