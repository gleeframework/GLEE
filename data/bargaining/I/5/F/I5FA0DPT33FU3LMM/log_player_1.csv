"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. Since the money loses value for me with each round, I want to end the game as soon as possible while still being somewhat fair. I'll include a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, the fact that the money is worth 20% less for me in this round means I'd actually be getting less value than Bob. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer deal""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4500 and keep $5500 for myself. Since the money loses value for me with each round, I'm willing to give Bob a bit less than half to make up for the loss. I'll include a message explaining that this offer takes inflation into account, hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
