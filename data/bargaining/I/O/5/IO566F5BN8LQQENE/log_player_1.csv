"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script.  60-40 my way feels more balanced to me.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'd like to propose a new offer that takes this into account.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation, I'll propose a new offer that adjusts for the decreased value of my gain. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This 45-55 split should be fair, considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $4,500 and Bob receives $5,500."
