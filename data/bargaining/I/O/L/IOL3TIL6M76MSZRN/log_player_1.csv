"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave Bob with 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, my gain of 40 dollars in this round is actually worth 38 dollars in real value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
