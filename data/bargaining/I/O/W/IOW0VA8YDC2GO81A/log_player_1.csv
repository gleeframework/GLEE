"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and leave $10 for Bob. It's a good starting point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option. After the inflation, my share is worth less than it was in the first round, and if I reject this, I risk getting an even worse offer in the next round."
