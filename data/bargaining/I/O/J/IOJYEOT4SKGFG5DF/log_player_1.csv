"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I'm hoping to secure a large share early on before inflation significantly impacts the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money. Inflation is a real threat, and continuing to play risks losing more in the long run."
