Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation will hurt you more than it will hurt me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can move on before the inflation eats away too much. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is frustrating, but accepting now would mean Bob gets the advantage of our initial compromise ($5500 to $4500) while inflation has already significantly eaten into my potential gains. I need to hold out for a better deal."
