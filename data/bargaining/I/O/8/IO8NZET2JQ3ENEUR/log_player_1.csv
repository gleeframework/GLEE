"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly biased offer, but still a fair one. Consider it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of the original, so I'll be getting $38 instead of $40.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining value of the money, especially since I'll have to make a new proposal next round with even less value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With another 5% loss due to inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the original, so I'll be getting $36.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more generous, Bob. Consider this compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the remaining value, which is $55, and keeping 45% for myself, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. No more games. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With another 14.26% loss due to inflation, my gain is now worth 85.74% of the original, so I'll be getting $34.74 instead of $36.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Meeting in the middle seems like a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with even less value."
