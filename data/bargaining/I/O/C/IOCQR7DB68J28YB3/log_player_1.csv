"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly this time. I think a fair split will help us avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
