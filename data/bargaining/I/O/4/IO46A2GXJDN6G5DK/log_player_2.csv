"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice offers in the next round. It seems like she's trying to take advantage of the inflation disparity."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but I'll need a slightly bigger share to offset the inflation impact on my side. Let's split it this way.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less than before, but still need a larger share 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's not ideal, I'm taking a hit on the inflation, but it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
