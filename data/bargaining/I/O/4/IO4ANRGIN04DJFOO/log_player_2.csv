"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I take $6,000, you take $4,000. It's a good deal for you to avoid the risk of inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than that! The risk of inflation isn't that high in the first round, and I'm willing to take my chances to try to get a bigger share of the money.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more in my favor. Here it is:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than your initial offer, Alice. How about we split it 55-45? That way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm offering you $4,250, which is more than you'd get if we split 50/50 after another round of inflation. Time is money - let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not convinced by Alice's argument. The difference between her offer and a potential 50/50 split after another round of inflation is not that significant, and I think I can still negotiate a better deal. Let's keep playing! ###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that takes into account the effects of inflation. Here it is:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of time, but I'm not willing to settle for less than 50% of the original amount. Considering the inflation, I think a 52.5-47.5 split is a fair compromise. Let's end this game before we both lose more value.""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This offer is just slightly in my favor, and it guarantees you a good chunk of the money before it depreciates further. Don't be greedy, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not convinced by Alice's message. She's trying to create a sense of urgency, but I think there's still room for negotiation. The offer is not significantly better than the previous ones, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a more favorable deal. Let's keep playing!###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that takes into account the increasing effects of inflation. Here it is:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, we've reached a point where the inflation is starting to hurt both of us significantly. I think it's time for a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and we can stop the depreciation of the money. Let's be fair and end this game now.""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice thinks!"
