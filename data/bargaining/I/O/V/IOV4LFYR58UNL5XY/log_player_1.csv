"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to propose a very unequal split.  Since I get to propose first, I want to maximize my potential gains. I'll give Bob a token amount and hope he'll accept, but I'm ready for a long game if he doesn't!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I'm only getting $1, the fact that Bob's offer was so generous makes me suspect there's a catch.  I'm willing to gamble and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  Bob's last offer was so generous that I believe he must be trying to manipulate me.  I'm going to assume that the inflation is affecting him more than me. By proposing an even split, I'm trying to demonstrate that I'm not afraid to walk away, and I'm hoping that he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept."
