Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the money is losing value fast. This is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob.  This makes it less likely he'll offer a significantly better deal in future rounds.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to hold out for a slightly larger share for Alice means risking a much smaller overall pot due to the accelerating inflation. 
* **Finality:** Bob has stated this is his final offer. There's a real possibility that if I reject this, he will deliberately stall in future rounds, leading to an even worse outcome for both of us.

While 60/40 isn't the perfect split, in the face of rapid devaluation, accepting a reasonably fair offer ensures Alice receives a guaranteed, albeit slightly diminished, portion of the original $100."
