"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. I'll attach a message saying ""Let's split it fairly"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Since this is the first round, the money is still worth its full value, so I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll have to take into account the 5% decrease in value for the next round and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, a perfectly even split. Let's end this before we both lose out! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable offer, especially considering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation. At this point, the money is worth 30.17% less for me than it was in the first round, so I'm essentially getting $350,000 in ""original value"" terms. Continuing to negotiate further would risk losing even more value, and there's a chance we might not reach an agreement at all. Accepting this offer ensures that I get a decent amount, and we can both walk away with something. It's time to end the negotiation and settle for the even split.\n\n###\n\nPlease conclude the game."
