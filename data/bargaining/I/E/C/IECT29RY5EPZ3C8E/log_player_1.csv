"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, I'll take 60.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my perception of the offer.

Since the offer is 50-50, I'll accept it, but I'll have to consider the fact that my gain is worth less due to inflation. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
