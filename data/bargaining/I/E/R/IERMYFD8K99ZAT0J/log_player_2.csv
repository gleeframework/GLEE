"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While the money I gain is worth less, it's still a significant increase from the previous round.
* **Potential for Future Loss:**  If I reject this offer, the next round I'll have to make an offer, and there's a high chance Alice will reject it again, potentially leading to a worse deal for me due to inflation.

While I'd prefer more money, accepting this offer is the most rational choice given the circumstances."
