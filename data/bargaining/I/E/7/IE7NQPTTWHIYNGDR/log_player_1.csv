"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money, as I'm the one taking the risk of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than nothing if he rejects this offer and we move to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

This is my counter-offer. I'm increasing my proposed gain to $4,000, which is still significantly less than my initial offer, but reflects the increased risk from inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking a slightly smaller share and ending the game."
