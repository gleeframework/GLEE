"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking $90 for myself and giving $10 to Bob. This is a fair offer, considering the risk of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is significant and accepting Bob's offer is the best option. My share is worth less now, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future."
