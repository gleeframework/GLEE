"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the lion's share of the money, but I am willing to leave Bob with a decent sum. I am hoping he will accept this in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial offer. Even though inflation has reduced the value of the money, I am still better off rejecting this offer and proposing a new one in the next round. I believe I can still get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, acknowledging the effect of inflation on both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in reaching a compromise and accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer isn't ideal, the continued inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  It's better for me to accept this offer and secure a decent amount, rather than risk further inflation and potentially end up with even less in the next round."
