"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain, considering the potential risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is not terrible, the potential for inflation makes it risky. Rejecting and proposing a counter offer might yield a better outcome for Bob."
