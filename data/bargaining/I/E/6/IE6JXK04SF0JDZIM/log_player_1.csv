I'm going to be greedy and try to get the most money I can in the first round!  Let's see how Bob feels about this offer.  Hopefully, he won't think it's too unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 8100, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money. Bob's offer was a bit too much in my favor, and I'm hoping that he'll see the value in getting something rather than nothing. Let's see if this offer works!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm going to continue lowering my offer, but only slightly.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that the longer we play, the less money we'll both receive due to inflation. I think he'll be more willing to accept a slightly lower offer than the one in the previous round.  Let's see how this goes!"

{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but not by too much.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I still think I can get a better deal than what Bob is offering. I'm hoping that he will realize that we're both losing money with each passing round and will start to be more reasonable.  Let's see what happens!"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm starting to get nervous. The inflation is really starting to bite now, and I'm afraid we're both losing money quickly. I'm hoping that Bob will start to see the value in accepting an offer sooner rather than later.  I need to try and get a decent share of the money, even if it means accepting a smaller amount than I would have liked at the start. Let's see how this goes!"
