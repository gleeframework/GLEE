# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this one.

# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! I'm not impressed with the 25/75 split, but I'll think about it.

Considering the inflation, the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than before, and I'm not sure if I want to settle for such a small share. I'll have to weigh my options carefully.

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests. This offer is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous one, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
