"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is meant to convey that I'm open to negotiation, but I believe this is a fair starting point. Let me know what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I deserve a little more for taking the risk! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}

I've reduced my initial offer to try to find a middle ground with Bob, taking into account that the money is now worth 10% less than in the first round, and 1% less than in the second round, due to inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
