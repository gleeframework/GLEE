"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, reflecting my role in the negotiation process.  Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is fair, especially since he's trying to take advantage of the fact that his money is worth 20% less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, considering the inflation impact on Bob's share. A fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the inflation effect on Bob's share. I hope Bob will consider this offer seriously!"
