"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  This gives me a slightly larger share, but you'll still get a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Your starting offer was a bit too greedy, Alice. Let's meet closer to the middle this time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I need a bit more than that. This offer is still generous considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my larger inflation rate. While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. The inflation hurts me more than you. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but I need to be mindful of my own losses. This offer is a compromise - it's less than my previous offer but still gives me a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but her pace is far too slow.  She's betting I'll crack under the pressure of my higher inflation rate. By rejecting this offer, I send a clear message: a fair deal is non-negotiable, and I'm willing to risk it all for a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm sticking to 50/50.  It's the only fair deal, and with each round, we both lose more. Do you want to walk away with nothing?""}
