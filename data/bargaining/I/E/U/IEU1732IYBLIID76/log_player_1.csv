Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation we'll both be facing. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'd like to get a bit more.
