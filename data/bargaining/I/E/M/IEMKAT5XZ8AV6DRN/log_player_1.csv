"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'll try to get a good starting point. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 5% less, so I'll get $700,000 * 0.95 = $665,000, and Bob will get $300,000.

I'll reject this offer because it's not as favorable to me as my initial offer. I'll wait for a better opportunity.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'll get $700,000 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $646,225, and Bob will get $300,000 * 0.95 = $285,000.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'll get $700,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $601,820, and Bob will get $300,000.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal for me than my previous offer and I don't want to risk waiting for another round.
