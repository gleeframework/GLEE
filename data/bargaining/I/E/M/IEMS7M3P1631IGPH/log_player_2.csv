"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for us both to secure a good amount before inflation takes its toll. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems reasonable at first glance, it's important to remember the inflation factor. I'm aiming for a larger share to compensate for the faster devaluation of my money. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, Alice, but I need to protect my own interests due to the faster inflation rate I'm facing.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but your offer doesn't reflect the significant impact inflation has on my side.  Let's try to find a middle ground. This offer is a compromise,  and it's important to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still too low for me, considering the inflation rate I'm facing.  It's getting increasingly urgent to reach a better split. I'll see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing value with each passing round.  I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a larger portion to protect my gains. We need to find a solution quickly before the value of our potential earnings plummets.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of the inflation. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50 is fair and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is becoming increasingly attractive due to the rapid inflation. Accepting a 50/50 split is the most sensible option at this point, as further rounds risk diminishing the value of our potential earnings significantly."
