"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept it quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less than 50/50 split, but I think it's still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing by 5% each round, I need to think strategically. While 40 is less than 50, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds. 

I'll accept this offer.

```
