I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping this is a fair enough offer to get us started, but I'm also aware of the potential inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm taking into account the inflation. I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, I might get nothing at all in later rounds. 6000 is better than nothing, especially with the decreasing value of the money."
