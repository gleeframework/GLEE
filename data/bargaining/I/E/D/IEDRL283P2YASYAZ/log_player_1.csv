"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a straightforward proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 5% less for Bob, I'll have to consider this. Here's my decision:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I don't think this is a good deal for me, as I'm giving up more than I was initially willing to give up. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to adjust my offer to take a bit more. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering to take 55% of the initial $10,000, and leave 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less for Bob, his offer is even more skewed towards him. Here's my decision:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to give up more than 47.5% of the initial $10,000, so I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to find a middle ground. Since Bob's offers are getting closer to my target, I'll make a new proposal that's slightly more generous to him. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}

I'm offering to take 52% of the initial $10,000, and leave 48% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 22.62% less for Bob, his offer is even more skewed towards him now. However, I'm getting closer to my target, so I'll consider this offer. Here's my decision:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer of 4500 for me and 5500 for him. It's not my ideal outcome, but I'm willing to settle for this."
