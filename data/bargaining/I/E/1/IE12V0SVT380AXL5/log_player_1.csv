"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! Considering the decreased value of money, I think I'll have to accept this offer. The reduced value of my gain is a bit steeper, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.
