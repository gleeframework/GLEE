Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to hopefully get him to accept quickly.  This way, we can both get our money before the inflation kicks in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the money I get is less than what I initially wanted, I'm still getting something.  Accepting will allow me to get a share before the value drops even further due to inflation."
