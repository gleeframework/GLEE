**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are quickly eroding Bob's potential gains. Accepting a less favorable offer now is better than risking even worse outcomes in future rounds. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** With each round, Bob loses 20% of the value, making holding out increasingly risky. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems determined to get a larger share and is unlikely to agree to a significantly better offer for Bob. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees Bob at least $400,000. Rejecting means gambling on Alice offering a better deal in later rounds, where the money will be worth even less.

It's a tough decision, but in this scenario, cutting losses and taking the guaranteed amount is the more rational choice for Bob."
