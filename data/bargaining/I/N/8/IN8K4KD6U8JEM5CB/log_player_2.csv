Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us considering the time pressure.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before I take more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful, but at this point, I'm getting severely squeezed by the inflation. Accepting Alice's offer is better than risking getting even less in a potential Round 6."
