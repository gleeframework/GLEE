"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to be so... optimistic!

Considering the offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that leaves me with only 30. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation. Considering this, I'll make a more conservative proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Let's aim for a balanced split. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a chance to reconsider! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, accepting this offer would mean I'd be getting a relatively small amount of money. However, it's still better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower potential earnings.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be satisfied and we can finally settle the division.
