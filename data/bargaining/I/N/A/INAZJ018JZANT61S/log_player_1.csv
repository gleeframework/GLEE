"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly uneven split is fairer, given the risk of inflation.  Let's see how this works for you! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I understand Bob's concern about inflation. After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm willing to consider a slightly uneven split, but I think I can do better than this. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 2:3 is a better split given the inflation risk. Your turn again!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
