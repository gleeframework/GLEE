Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more evenly this time, Alice.  It's important to find a fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""It's my turn to propose a fair solution, Bob.  Let's get this settled."" 
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Time Pressure:** Inflation is hurting me more than Bob.  Delaying benefits him more.
* **Understanding Bob:** Bob wants a ""fair"" solution, implying he's not looking to completely dominate the deal.
* **Slight Edge:** I'm taking a slightly better split than he offered, hoping he'll see it as reasonable enough to avoid further inflation losses."
