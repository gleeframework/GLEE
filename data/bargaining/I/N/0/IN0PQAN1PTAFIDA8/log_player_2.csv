Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair deal, Bob, especially considering the time pressure. Let's not let greed get in the way of a good agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is steadily decreasing her offer, taking advantage of the fact that the deal is getting worse for me over time. However, 400,000 is a significant drop, and accepting would set a weak precedent. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, even with the time pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient outcome.  Don't let greed push us towards getting nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I am shifting to a more drastic strategy.  Alice is clearly taking advantage of the time pressure and my dwindling returns. Offering a 50/50 split accomplishes two things:

1. **Fairness Appeal:** It highlights the inherent fairness of an equal split, potentially making Alice reconsider her aggressive stance.
2. **Urgency:**  With fewer rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing increases for both of us.  A 50/50 split becomes the safest option to guarantee a payout."
