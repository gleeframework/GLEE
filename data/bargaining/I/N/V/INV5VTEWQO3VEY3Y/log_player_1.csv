I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage Bob faces. Let's see if he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. I'm still the one with the higher inflation penalty, so I'm not going to accept a 20/80 split in his favor!  Let's see if he'll budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but still need to keep a significant majority due to the inflation penalty. I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is ridiculous!  Bob is getting incredibly greedy. I'm not accepting a 10/90 split in his favor. He's going to have to do better than that if he wants to reach an agreement before we both lose everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm taking another step towards compromise, offering a 60/40 split.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but he needs to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting increasingly unreasonable.  This offer is just insulting. He's taking advantage of the inflation, and I won't let him bully me into accepting such a lopsided deal.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but he needs to come back with something fairer."

Round 7

This is getting serious. We're both losing a lot of money with each round. I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that we're running out of time. Let's end this before we both get nothing."
