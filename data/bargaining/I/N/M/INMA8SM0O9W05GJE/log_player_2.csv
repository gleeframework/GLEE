Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, the deal is getting significantly worse due to inflation.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and it's time to push for a more favorable outcome. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the initial potential gain."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this.  Don't let inflation eat away at our potential winnings!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The increasing rate of inflation means we're losing significant value with each passing round.  A 50/50 split, even though not ideal initially, is now the most logical choice. It guarantees a reasonable share and prevents further losses due to the shrinking pot."
