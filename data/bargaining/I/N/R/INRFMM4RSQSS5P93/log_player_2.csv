Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, inflation is in my favor 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but with each round, the value of my share diminishes significantly.  While I'd prefer a larger portion, waiting any longer will only hurt me more. Accepting Alice's offer now secures me something, which is better than risking getting even less later."
