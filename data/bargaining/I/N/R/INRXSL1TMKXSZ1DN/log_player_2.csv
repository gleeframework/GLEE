"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm giving you 10% of the money, which is more than you'd get in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. With inflation, the money is worth the same to me, but it's worth 20% less to Alice. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make my proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation effect on Alice's side. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in this round, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits me more than the previous offer.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 250000, ""alice_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.

# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  We can keep going, but the money will keep shrinking for me.  This is the best deal you'll get. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer because, despite Alice's warning, I still believe I can get a better deal. The money is still worth the same to me, but it's now worth 36% less to Alice. I'll try to push for an even better split in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please let Alice know that I'm not afraid of her ""final offer"" and that I'm willing to keep playing.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
