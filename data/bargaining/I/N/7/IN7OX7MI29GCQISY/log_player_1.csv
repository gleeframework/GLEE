"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% since I'm the one proposing.  Fair's fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think 60% is fair, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% of the original), I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split to account for the decreasing value.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You took 60% last time, now it's my turn to be fair""
