"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to give Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
