"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself. This is a generous offer considering the inflation rates, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid losing more value in the next rounds. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds. With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob in each subsequent round, the pressure is on Bob to make a deal before the value drops too low. I'm counting on Bob's increasing desperation to secure a deal, which might lead to a more favorable offer for me in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Inflation is costing us both, let's settle""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $430,000 and taking $570,000 for myself. This offer is slightly less generous than my initial one, reflecting the decreased value of the money due to inflation. The message ""Inflation is costing us both, let's settle"" aims to remind Bob that the longer we drag this out, the less the money is worth to both of us, and it's in our mutual interest to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We're both losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, splitting the money down the middle seems like a reasonable compromise. At this point, both of us are losing substantial value with each passing round, and I don't think I can negotiate a significantly better deal. By accepting this offer, I'm securing $500,000, which, although worth 14.26% less than initially, is still a considerable amount. Further negotiations might lead to more losses due to inflation, so it's wise to settle now.
