# Bob gain: 800000

Bob is being incredibly stubborn and trying to take advantage.  While the inflation is hurting, it's better to hold out and aim for a much better split. There's still time to negotiate a better deal."

This is getting very risky, but Bob is clearly trying to wear me down. It's a gamble, but I think I can still get him higher if I hold out for another round or two."
