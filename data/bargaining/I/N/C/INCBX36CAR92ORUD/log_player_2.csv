"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I still need a decent share.  How about a 55/45 split? This feels like a good compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
