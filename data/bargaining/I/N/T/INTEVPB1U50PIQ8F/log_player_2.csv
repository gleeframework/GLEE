Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but time is working against us both. This is my final offer, and it's the same split you proposed last round - only this time, you'll be getting the lower amount due to the inflation. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
