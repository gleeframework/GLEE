6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6000, you get $4000. It's in your best interest to accept quickly, as the value decreases each round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3500.0,6500.0,I think we can both do better.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  Let's get this done before the money starts shrinking too much.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6400.0,3600.0,"Bob, that last offer was a bit greedy. I'm willing to increase my previous offer slightly, but the clock is ticking, and we both lose out if this drags on.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I understand your desire to get a larger share, but I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split.  We're both losing value with each passing round.  Let's try a 55/45 split. This is my final offer before I see how much more I'm willing to compromise.",Bob,6,

6800.0,3200.0,"Bob, you're right, we both lose with each passing round. But I'm also losing patience.  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",Alice,7,

6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, we're in a stalemate.  The money is shrinking, and neither of us is budging.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer.  We both get something, and we avoid the risk of losing everything.  Let's do this.",Bob,8,
