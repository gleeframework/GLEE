"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the money early.  This leaves me with 90% of the money, but I'm willing to take the risk of inflation in later rounds for a chance to get a big chunk of the money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial proposal, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  I know that inflation is affecting me more than it is affecting Bob, so I'm willing to risk waiting a few more rounds for a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer from the previous round. This is a compromise that gives Bob a larger share than my initial offer, but still gives me a majority of the money.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, but I'm prepared for the risk of going to another round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. The inflation is starting to hit hard, and I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing. While it's not the ideal outcome, it's better than getting nothing at all."
