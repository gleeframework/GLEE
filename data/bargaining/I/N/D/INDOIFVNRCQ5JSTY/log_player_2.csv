"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a more even split, Bob.  Let's try meeting in the middle this time. This offer reflects a more balanced distribution while still giving me a slight edge due to the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation to her advantage, but she's still asking for significantly more.  While the deal is better than her first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, even considering the inflation. I need to show I'm willing to walk away from a bad deal to get her to negotiate more fairly."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon.  This offer is slightly better for me than yours was for you in the previous round, acknowledging the impact of inflation on my side.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** Time is running out, and Alice needs to feel the pressure to make a deal. 
* **Fairness:** This offer is slightly more generous to Bob than Alice's previous offer was to her,  demonstrating a willingness to be fair but firm. 
* **Inflation:**  The offer accounts for the faster rate of inflation affecting Bob's potential gains."
