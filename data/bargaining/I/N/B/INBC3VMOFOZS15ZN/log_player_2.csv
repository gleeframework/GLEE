"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money as time passes. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer might seem fair at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation rates. Alice is losing money at a much faster rate than Bob, making this offer more favorable to her in the long run.  Since I have time, I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I believe this split is more equitable considering the different inflation rates we face. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. This offer acknowledges the time pressure while still accounting for the rapid devaluation of my share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, even accounting for the inflation.  I'm losing money faster than her, so I need to secure a larger portion of the total to compensate for that. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of the money is dropping quickly.  I'm offering a split that is more balanced, considering our respective inflation rates.  This is my final offer.""}
