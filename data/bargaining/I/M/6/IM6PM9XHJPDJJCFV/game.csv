700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, I propose I take $700,000 and you take $300,000. This is a generous offer considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's settle this quickly.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I think we can both do better than your previous offer. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, considering the inflation we'll both face in the coming rounds. Let's be fair and reach a reasonable agreement.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  My previous offer was already generous.  I'm adjusting it slightly to $650,000 for me and $350,000 for you.  This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and the fact that your share is losing value faster than mine. Accept this now before inflation eats away at your potential gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice,  I understand your position, but we need to be fair here. I'm proposing a 60/40 split,  which acknowledges the inflation we're both experiencing.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before we lose more money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're chasing diminishing returns. I'm offering you $400,000.  Take it before inflation eats away even more of your potential share.  This is my final offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, we've both lost significant value due to inflation. It's time to be reasonable. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest way to divide what's left.  Let's avoid further losses and end this negotiation.",Bob,6,
