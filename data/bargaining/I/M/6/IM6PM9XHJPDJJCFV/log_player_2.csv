Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  My previous offer was already generous.  I'm adjusting it slightly to $650,000 for me and $350,000 for you.  This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and the fact that your share is losing value faster than mine. Accept this now before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
