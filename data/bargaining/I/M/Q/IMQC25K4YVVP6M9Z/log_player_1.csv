Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will take it in the first round.  I'll try to maximize my gains while still giving Bob something to consider.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer gives me a significant amount of money. It's much better than the 5% loss I would experience if I were to reject and propose again. I'll accept this offer."
