Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly, Alice.  It's a fair deal and we both get a good amount.  
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to stick with my previous offer. It's fair to us both, and we can end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the clock is ticking, accepting an offer where I consistently get significantly less is not in my best interest. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to remain firm and hope he becomes more agreeable as the rounds progress and the threat of getting nothing looms larger."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering you a decent amount, let's finish this now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting desperate and trying to lowball me now. It's a terrible offer and accepting would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain.  I need to hold my ground, the pressure is on him to make a reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to play hardball.  Offering a 50/50 split removes any pretense of negotiation and puts the pressure squarely on Bob.  He knows the value of the deal is decreasing with each round, and my strong stance might finally push him to accept a reasonable offer."
