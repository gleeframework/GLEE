Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start! Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%."

Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get a good share! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. 

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet. I want to negotiate for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the second round, which is 95% of 95% of the original amount, or 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 ratio, with me getting 70% of the current value of the money and Bob getting 30%."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 55% is a fair share for me, especially considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate for more."
