"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm offering a 50/50 split. We both get an equal share, and we can avoid any further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

Even though I proposed a slightly better deal for myself in Round 1, accepting Bob's offer in Round 2 is the logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Waiting any longer means the money will be worth even less. 
* **Guaranteed Return:** A 50/50 split guarantees me $500,000. Rejecting this offer risks getting a worse deal in a future round where the money is worth less. 
* **Fairness:** Bob's offer is fair, and accepting it avoids unnecessary conflict or potential stalemate."
