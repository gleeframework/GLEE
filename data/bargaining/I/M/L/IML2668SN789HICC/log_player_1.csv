Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very assertive offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money.  I'm assuming Bob will be hesitant to reject this offer, as he'll get a small amount but something is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer my initial offer, the inflation is a significant factor. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances, and it's better than potentially getting nothing in the later rounds."
