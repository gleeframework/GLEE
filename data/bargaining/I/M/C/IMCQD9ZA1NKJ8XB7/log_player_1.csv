  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be too generous since the money is worth less in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
