I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to secure a large portion for myself, leaving Bob with just a small amount.  This will hopefully incentivize him to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even though I get less in this round due to inflation, I am confident that I can do better in the next round. I will be the one making the offer, and I will aim for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

My reasoning for this offer:

* **Inflation:**  I'm accounting for the 20% inflation I've experienced, but I'm also factoring in that Bob has only experienced a 5% inflation.
* **Balance:** This offer is a more balanced split than the previous rounds, and I'm hoping it will entice Bob to accept. 
* **Incentive:**  This offer still gives me a significant portion of the money, but it leaves Bob with enough that he might find it more worthwhile to accept rather than risk a lower offer in the next round."
