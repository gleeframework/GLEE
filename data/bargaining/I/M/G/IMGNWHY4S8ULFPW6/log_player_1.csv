I'm going for a slightly uneven split to start.  I think it's a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's important to consider inflation. Taking a slightly smaller amount now is better than risking further losses in the next round."
