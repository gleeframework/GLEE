"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my fair offer, now it's my turn to make a better one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can do better, huh?

I'll consider his new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining money. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of me, but I'm not falling for it. I'll give you a slightly better deal this time.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not giving Bob too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not giving me enough, but I'll give you another chance to make it right! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being a tough negotiator, huh?

I'll consider his new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining money. I'll wait for Bob's next offer, but I'm getting a bit concerned about the value of the money decreasing due to inflation..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and the money's losing value by the minute. Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but also willing to compromise to get a decent share."
