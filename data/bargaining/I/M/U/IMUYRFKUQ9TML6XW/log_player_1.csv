"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the risk of us both getting less with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
