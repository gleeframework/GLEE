"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering you $20, and I'll take $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. I'll accept the offer.
