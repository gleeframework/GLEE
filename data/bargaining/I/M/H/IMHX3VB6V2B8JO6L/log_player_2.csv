Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Your 50/50 split will be less fair in later rounds due to the inflation. I propose a 60/40 split to account for that.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's compromise at 55/45. This gives you some advantage to account for inflation while still being fair. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
