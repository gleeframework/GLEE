50.0,50.0,Let's start fair! I propose a 50/50 split.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,Your 50/50 split will be less fair in later rounds due to the inflation. I propose a 60/40 split to account for that.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand your point about inflation, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's compromise at 55/45. This gives you some advantage to account for inflation while still being fair.",Alice,3,
