"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70% and you can have 30%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me taking the larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we'll both have to deal with. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I think 55% is a bit steep for me. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. 55% was a bit too high for me, but 55% is a good starting point. Let's compromise and meet in the middle.""
}
