Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to get the game over quickly and minimize the impact of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than what I initially proposed, and I know he'll face inflation in the next round. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split, but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  I'm betting that Bob will be more interested in securing some money now before inflation eats away at his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting frustrating! Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of inflation.  I'm still going to reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  At this point, I'm not sure how much the money will be worth by the end of the game, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's greed just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer is closer to Bob's previous proposal, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise after seeing the impact of inflation on his potential gains in the previous round."
