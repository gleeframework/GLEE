"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, will take $80 and Bob will take $20. I'm starting with a fair share, and we can adjust from here based on our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain would be $76 in this round.

I don't think splitting it evenly is the best option for me, especially since I'm still getting less than my initial offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, so my gain would be $76.4.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I still need a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain would be $68.96 in this round.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, as it seems like Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 19.13% less than in the first round, so my gain would be $61.68.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a fair share and getting a decent amount for myself."
