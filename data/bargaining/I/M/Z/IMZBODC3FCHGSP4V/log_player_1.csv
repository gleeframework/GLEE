"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amounts I would gain are:

* Round 1: 70
* Round 2: 56 (70 * 0.8)
* Round 2 (Bob's offer): 60

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's better than the current effective amount I would gain if I were to reject and proceed to the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
