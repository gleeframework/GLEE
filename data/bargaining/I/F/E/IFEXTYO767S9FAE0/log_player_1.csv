"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game early!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get a better deal for me! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to consider the value of the $400,000 in terms of its purchasing power. Similarly, Bob's $600,000 is worth 20% less, so I'll have to consider its value in terms of its purchasing power.

After calculating the values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a good share!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, where I'll get $450,000 and Bob will get $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. The $300,000 I'll get is worth even less than before, and the $700,000 Bob will get is worth even less than that.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm not sure I can do better at this point. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will stick to his word and not try to renegotiate later.
