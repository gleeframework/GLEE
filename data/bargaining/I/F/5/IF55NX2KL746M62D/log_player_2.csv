"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a reasonable split.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but 52/48 feels fairer considering inflation is impacting us differently. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. The 52/48 split is closer to what I'm looking for, but I believe I can negotiate further. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the increasing inflation impact, I think 58/42 is a more suitable split. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is getting out of hand. Let's go back to the 50/50 split before we lose even more money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait, this 50/50 split is based on the original amount, but the money has lost value due to inflation. Considering that, this offer is actually worse than the previous 52/48 split she offered. I'll reject it and try to get a better deal. {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed getting out of hand. Considering the current value loss, I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split. Let's end this before we both lose even more.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a bit more to reach an agreement. Let's split it 45/55.  It's getting risky to wait any longer with inflation so high. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, this 55/45 split in my favor is a relatively good deal. I'd rather secure this amount now than risk losing even more value in subsequent rounds. {""decision"": ""accept""}"
