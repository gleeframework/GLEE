5000.0,5000.0,Let's start fair.  I propose a 50/50 split.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a reasonable split.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit, but 52/48 feels fairer considering inflation is impacting us differently.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Given the increasing inflation impact, I think 58/42 is a more suitable split. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,The inflation is getting out of hand. Let's go back to the 50/50 split before we lose even more money.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Inflation is indeed getting out of hand. Considering the current value loss, I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split. Let's end this before we both lose even more.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I'm willing to budge a bit more to reach an agreement. Let's split it 45/55.  It's getting risky to wait any longer with inflation so high.,Alice,7,
