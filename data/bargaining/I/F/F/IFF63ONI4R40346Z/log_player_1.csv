"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80-20 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to benefit, with a slightly larger share for Alice.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise with a 60-40 split. It's still a decent share for both of us, and I think we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
