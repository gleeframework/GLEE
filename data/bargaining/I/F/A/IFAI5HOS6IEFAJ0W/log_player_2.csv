Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose dividing the $10,000 into $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This keeps our shares relatively close to what they were in the first round, while accounting for the decrease in value of the money. Let me know if you find this acceptable.

# Alice gain: 6000
