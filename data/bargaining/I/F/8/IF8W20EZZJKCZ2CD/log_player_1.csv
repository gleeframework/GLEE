"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my gain of $45 is actually worth $36.60 (80% of $45).

I accept Bob's offer.
