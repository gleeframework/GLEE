Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer. I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I should get the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

Even though the difference is narrowing, Alice is still consistently taking a larger share.  The inflation is hurting me far more than her. I need to push for a more significant change in my favor, otherwise, I risk getting a much worse deal later as the inflation bites harder."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. We're wasting time and losing money. Let's just split it evenly and be done with it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's time for a power play. Alice seems content to inch closer to a slightly less favorable split. By offering a perfectly even split, I'm calling her bluff. It emphasizes the fairness aspect, especially with the increasing inflation, and puts the pressure on her to either accept a reasonable deal or risk both of us losing significantly more."
