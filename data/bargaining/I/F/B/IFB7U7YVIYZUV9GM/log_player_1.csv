"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you 40% of the original 100$, which is $40. This way, I get 60% of the original amount, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, so I'll have to think carefully.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
