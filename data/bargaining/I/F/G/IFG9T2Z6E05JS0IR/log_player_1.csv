I'm starting with a very uneven split. This is a strategic move, as I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount early on.  Since the money is losing value with each round, I'm hoping he'll take what he can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's not ideal, but given the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to split the money evenly, I think it's a good deal.  It's better to take 50% of something than risk getting nothing at all!"
