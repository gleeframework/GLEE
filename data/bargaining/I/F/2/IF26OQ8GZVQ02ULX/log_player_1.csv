"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split! That's a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a 70-30 split, which I think is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise."
