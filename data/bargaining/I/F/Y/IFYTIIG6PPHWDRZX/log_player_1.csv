"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair and simple""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiations."
