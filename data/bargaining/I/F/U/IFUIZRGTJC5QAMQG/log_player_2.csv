"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this.  I'm feeling generous, but time is money! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives me 30% of the money, but I think I can get a better deal considering the inflation rates. In the next round, the money will be worth 5% less for me, but 20% less for Alice, so I have some leverage to negotiate. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You'll lose more value than me if we don't agree soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure, but I need a better deal than that. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is losing value for both of us, Alice is losing more value than me due to the higher inflation rate she's experiencing. The current offer is still not favorable enough for me. Given the increasing pressure on Alice due to her higher inflation rate, I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's see what Alice comes up with next!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Given the significant loss of value for you, I'm willing to meet in the middle. This is a fair split, considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, Bob. I'm taking a risk here, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Given the substantial loss of value for Alice due to her high inflation rate, I believe she's under more pressure to reach an agreement than I am. Alice says this is her final offer, but I'm willing to take the risk that she'll come back to the negotiating table rather than letting the money become worthless for both of us. With only a few rounds left, the pressure is mounting, and I'm hoping to secure a better deal. Let's see if Alice is truly done negotiating!"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Given the extreme loss of value for you, I think this is a generous offer. We're running out of time, and I'm not willing to go much lower than this. It's time to decide!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob!  I'm taking a huge hit from inflation.  Meet me halfway or we both lose! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Alice is indeed taking a huge hit from inflation, but that's what gives me the upper hand in these negotiations. Meeting her halfway at this point would mean I'm not leveraging the inflation difference to my advantage. With the money losing value rapidly for Alice, I believe she'll be more desperate to reach an agreement in the next rounds. I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a better offer or making a counteroffer that benefits me more. The pressure is high, but I think I can still get a better deal. Let's see what the next round brings!"

Given the massive loss of value for you, I think this is more than fair. It's time to accept or we both walk away with nothing!""}"
