Alice's offer:

This is a good starting point, but I can do better. Let's see how Alice reacts to my counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the devaluation in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the devaluation, this is the most I can offer 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is slightly better than my previous proposal, and considering the inflation, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round. It's time to take the win."
