"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the small share and let's end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I think I deserve more. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 4000. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

```

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me.""
