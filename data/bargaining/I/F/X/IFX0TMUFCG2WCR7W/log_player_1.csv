"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split is always a good starting point. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll think about the offer in terms of the original amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 50-50 split just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split. This way we both get a larger share, and we can move on to the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think about the offer in terms of the original amount.

However, I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, as it's not as favorable to me as I'd like.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
