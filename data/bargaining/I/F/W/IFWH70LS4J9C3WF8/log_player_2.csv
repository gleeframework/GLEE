"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, considering the future inflation. You get a small share now, but I am confident you will benefit from the future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While she claims to consider inflation, the proposed split doesn't reflect a fair adjustment. It's highly likely I can secure a much better deal in subsequent rounds, even with the impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I propose a more equitable split, Alice. This accounts for the inflation we both face, while still acknowledging my position as the first to propose in this round.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** This offer is significantly more balanced than Alice's initial proposal. 
* **Inflation:** While it leans in my favor, it acknowledges that Alice's money is also losing value due to inflation.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By offering a reasonable split, I increase the chances of Alice accepting and avoid further rounds where the money loses value for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest way to divide the money, given the current inflation rates. Let's end this game with an equal share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal considering I was the first to reject, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum that's worth considerably more than holding out for a slightly better deal in future rounds, where the money will be worth even less."
