"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving away too much! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'm not getting the same value as before.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give away too much more. I'm proposing a 45/55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
