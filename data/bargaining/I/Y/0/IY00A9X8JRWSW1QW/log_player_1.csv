"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'm going for a slightly greedy approach. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%. This should give me a good head start, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I have to acknowledge that inflation is working against me.  A 60/40 split is still better than risking further losses in the next round."
