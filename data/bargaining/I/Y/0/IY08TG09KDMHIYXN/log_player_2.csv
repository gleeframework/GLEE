Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still trying to take a significantly larger share. While it's closer to the middle, it's important to hold strong for a fairer split, especially as inflation is starting to eat into the overall value."
