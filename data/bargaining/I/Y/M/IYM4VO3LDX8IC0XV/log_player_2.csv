"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I think 60/40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I think I can get a better deal than 40%. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n### {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. 50/50 is the fairest way to split it, given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### Meeting in the middle at 50/50 seems fair, especially considering the inflation. It's better to secure this amount now rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds."
