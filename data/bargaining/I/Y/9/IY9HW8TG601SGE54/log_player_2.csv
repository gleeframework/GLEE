"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you can have the rest.  We can adjust later if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to settle for 10% right away.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point.  We can negotiate further if you're not happy with this.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think 65/35 is a more fair split considering we both rejected the previous offers. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not convinced that 35% is a good deal for me, especially since the value of my share keeps declining. Let's see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but 70/30 is the best I can do.  Let's try to reach an agreement before we both lose too much money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's split the money evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

At this point, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. Even though I'd prefer a larger share, I think a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get something out of this game."
