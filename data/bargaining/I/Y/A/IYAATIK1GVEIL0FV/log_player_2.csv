Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me more, but I still want a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aiming to get a larger share, but the inflation is working heavily against her.  While her offer isn't terrible, I'm betting I can push her further down as we get closer to the deadline and she gets more desperate."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the fairest I'm willing to go."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play a bit more aggressively. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm calling Alice's bluff. She's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and this might be enough to make her realize that holding out for more is too risky."
