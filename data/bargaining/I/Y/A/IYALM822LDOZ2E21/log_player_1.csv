I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can get this done quickly.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I initially hoped for, the inflation is a real concern. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the risk of getting nothing in later rounds is too high."
