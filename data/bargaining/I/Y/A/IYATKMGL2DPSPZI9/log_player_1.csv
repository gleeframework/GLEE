"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, leaving me with $60 and giving Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, since I'm the one proposing this time. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

However, I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is now worth even less, so I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You wanted 60, but I'll give you 45. That's the best I can do!""
}
