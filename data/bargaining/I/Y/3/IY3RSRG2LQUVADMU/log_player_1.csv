Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share now to avoid giving you too much control over the remaining funds. I propose a 60/40 split, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
