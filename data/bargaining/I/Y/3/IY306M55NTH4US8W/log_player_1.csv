"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about Bob getting 60% of the total amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking a bit more for myself while still leaving Bob with a decent chunk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive this time!

Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth even less than before, but he's still trying to take a big chunk. I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more aggressive offers.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more reasonable in the future.
