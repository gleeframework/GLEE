"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amounts:

Alice gain: $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000
Bob gain: $600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000

I'll accept this offer.
