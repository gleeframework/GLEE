"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is a fair starting point, given the uncertainty about inflation's impact on Bob.  It allows for negotiation and leaves some room for compromise.  I'm curious to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my ideal outcome is to get more, considering the inflation, accepting a 50/50 split is a reasonable choice.  It's better than losing 10% of my potential gain and risking further negotiation."
