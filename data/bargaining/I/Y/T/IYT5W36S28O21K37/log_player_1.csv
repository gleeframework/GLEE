Let's see if Bob will accept a generous 90% of the money!  ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a lot more than Bob offered me in round 1, I know I can still get a better deal!  The inflation hurts Bob more than it hurts me, so I'll push for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
