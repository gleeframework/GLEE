Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. I want to get the majority of the money, but not too much, since I don't know how Alice values the money. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 55 is actually equivalent to 36% of the original 50 I rejected in round 1. That's a decent offer, but I still want to try to get more. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to take advantage of Alice's previous offer, which was 55 for me and 45 for her. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll offer a bit more for myself to account for the decreased value. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42}"
