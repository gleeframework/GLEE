"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a pretty straightforward 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 5000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively 5700 in ""old"" dollars.

I think this is a reasonable offer, and I'd rather not risk going into further rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.
