# Bob's message: You get a small share, but it's a start 
# Alice gain: 100000

Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite lopsided in his favor, but I suppose it's a start as he mentioned.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'd like to make another counteroffer."

# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm still not giving in 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting ridiculous! A 0.5% share is not acceptable. I'm not going to get taken advantage of like this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to make another offer. It's time for a final showdown. I'll make a last-ditch effort to negotiate a better deal, but I'm not going to accept such an unfair offer."

Round 9

  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it""

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're going to regret this 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","NO WAY! Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. A 0.1% share is an insult. I'm not going to accept such an outrageous offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to negotiate further. It's clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of me, and I'm not going to let that happen. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if it means I don't get taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It seems like Bob's last offer was a bluff, and I'm not going to fall for it. Since we've reached the 11th round, I'll make a final, extreme offer that I think Bob will accept, but I'm not sure if I'll actually want to accept it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any more, take the last dollar""
}
```

This offer is essentially a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. If Bob accepts, I'll get 99.999% of the money, and he'll get the remaining $1. If he rejects, I'll walk away from the deal and leave the money on the table."
