"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. Take this offer while it's still worthwhile for you. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's offer is too skewed in her favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. My offer stands, but the value diminishes with each round. Don't miss out. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the value of the money is decreasing for me, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal than 25%. Let's proceed to the next round and see if Alice is willing to compromise further. The pressure of the decreasing value might work in my favor, and I'm willing to take that risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 37, ""alice_gain"": 63, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fairer share. Consider the decreasing value of my gain and meet me halfway.""}"
