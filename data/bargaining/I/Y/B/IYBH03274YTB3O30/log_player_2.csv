"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be willing to offer me more to avoid losing value.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make my proposal then.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, as Bob, I'll try to maximize my gain.)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make my proposal now. Since Alice is losing value with each round, I'll try to take advantage of that and offer her a bit less than half, while still being somewhat reasonable.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts to this proposal. Will she accept or try to negotiate further?\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a deal that significantly favors you.  Let's get closer to a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 51 
# Alice gain: 49 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nAnother round, another opportunity to negotiate. Considering the inflation, Alice is losing more value with each passing round. Her offer is closer to a fair split, but I think I can still push for a bit more, given the circumstances.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and see how Alice reacts in the next round. Perhaps she'll be willing to offer me even more to avoid losing further value.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'm curious to see Alice's next move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With each passing round, Alice is losing more value due to inflation. I'll try to take advantage of this and make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me than the previous one. However, I'll still aim to be somewhat reasonable to avoid pushing Alice away.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I think this is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts to this proposal. Will she accept, or will we continue negotiating?\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to avoid further inflation, but I'm not going to give up more than this. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Alice is getting more desperate to reach an agreement as the inflation takes its toll on her potential gain. Her offer is now closer to what I had proposed earlier, which suggests she's willing to compromise further.\n\n###\n\nHowever, considering the significant loss of value for Alice due to inflation, I believe I can hold out for an even better offer. The fact that my gain remains unaffected by inflation gives me an upper hand in these negotiations.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and see how Alice reacts in the next round. Given the increasing pressure from inflation, she might be willing to concede even more to reach an agreement.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'm eager to see Alice's next move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","As we enter Round 6, I can see that Alice is under increasing pressure due to the mounting inflation. Her potential gain has already decreased by over a third since the first round, and this trend will only continue if we don't reach an agreement soon.\n\n###\n\nGiven this context, I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me than the last one. However, I'll still aim to be somewhat reasonable to avoid pushing Alice away entirely. After all, if she feels the offer is too unfair, she might reject it out of principle, even if it means losing more value due to inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your potential gain, I believe this offer is a reasonable compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts to this proposal. Will she accept, or will we continue this delicate dance of negotiation?\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice."
