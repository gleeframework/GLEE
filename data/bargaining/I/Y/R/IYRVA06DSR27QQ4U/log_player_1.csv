"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, I want to secure as much as possible for myself.  Hopefully, he'll accept and we can both move on with our lives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too lopsided.  Since my money isn't losing value, I can afford to wait and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  While Bob's money is losing value, mine isn't, so this is a fair deal for both of us.  Hopefully, he'll see reason and accept."
