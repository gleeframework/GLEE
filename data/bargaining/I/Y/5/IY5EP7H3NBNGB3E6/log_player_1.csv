"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me a significant majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts or rejects!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of Bob's gain due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to take a slightly more aggressive stance. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts or rejects!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable with each round! With Bob's offer, he's gaining more than he did in the previous round, but the value of his gain is decreasing due to inflation.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer. It's not the best outcome for me, but it's better than going into another round.
