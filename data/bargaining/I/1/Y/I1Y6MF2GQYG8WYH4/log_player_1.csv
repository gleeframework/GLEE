"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

This way, I get 40% and Bob gets 60%. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll need to adjust my calculations accordingly.

With the inflation, my share of 3000 is now worth 95% of 3000, which is 2850. And Bob's share of 7000 is still worth 7000.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll reject this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll aim to get a better share considering the inflation. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the inflation."
