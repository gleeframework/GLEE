Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and split it evenly. A fair deal saves time and money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the same offer you made in Round 1. Let's be realistic â€“ accepting this now saves us both from further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly unfavorable compared to a perfectly even split, the inflation is eating into my potential gains with each round. Accepting now might be the best way to secure a reasonable amount, even if it means Bob gets a slightly better deal."
