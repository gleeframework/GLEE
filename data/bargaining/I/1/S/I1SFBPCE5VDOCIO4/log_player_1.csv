"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 50/50. I'd like to negotiate further to get a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less than the previous round), I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, meet me in the middle again!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I'm not being greedy 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less for me now, so I need to be careful.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $400,000 is a decent share, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money continuing to lose value."
