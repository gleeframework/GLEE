"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering I'm the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $3000 is worth only 80% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $2400. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer."
