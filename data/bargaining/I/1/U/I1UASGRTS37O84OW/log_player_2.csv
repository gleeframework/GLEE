{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split.  Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor, since the money will be worth more to me than it will to you in the next round.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for us both!""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a bigger share, Bob. But inflation is hurting me too.  Let's compromise: I'll take 55, and you take 45. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I appreciate your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with a 55/45 split.  Let's try 65/35.  This would give us both a better deal than the previous rounds, and we can finally end this game.""}
