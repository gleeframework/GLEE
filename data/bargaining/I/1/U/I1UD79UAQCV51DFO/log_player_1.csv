"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the funds in a 3:1 ratio. This allows us both to have a significant portion, while acknowledging the diminishing value of money with each round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. While the money is losing value, I believe this split is fair, allowing both of us to secure a sizable portion.  Let's end this game and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
