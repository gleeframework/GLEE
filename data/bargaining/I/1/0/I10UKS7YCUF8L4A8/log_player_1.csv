"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a good starting point that feels fair, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to push for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement for him, it's still not a good deal for me.  I'm confident I can secure a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to counter with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a small increase from my initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point to show that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me due to the inflation. Even though he's offering a larger share for himself, the actual value of my share has decreased significantly. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

This round, I'm willing to lower my share to 4500 to try and secure a deal. The inflation is really hurting me, and Bob's offer in the last round was significantly worse than my initial proposal. I think a 45/55 split is fair, given the circumstances."
