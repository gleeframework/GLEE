"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to consider the value of the money.

Since my gain is still $5000, and Bob's gain is $6000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, that means Bob's gain is equivalent to $4800 in terms of purchasing power.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous for me. I'll reject it.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. Since my gain was $5000 in the first round, and it's still worth the same, I'll aim to get a bit more.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, but still a fair deal!""
}
```

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to consider the value of the money.

Since my gain is still $5000, and Bob's gain is $4200, but it's worth 48.8% less due to inflation, that means Bob's gain is equivalent to $2651.20 in terms of purchasing power.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable. I'll accept it.
