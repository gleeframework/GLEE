"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000 and keep $8000. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

This offer is a 80/20 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give you a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's be reasonable and avoid any unnecessary rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's proposal. A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%).

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share. Consider this compromise!""
}
```

This offer is a 70/30 split in my favor, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount to keep the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need a decent return as well. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).

I'll consider Bob's proposal. A 40/60 split is a bit more favorable to him, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 64.61% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% - 9% - 9% = 64.61%).

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain. Let's meet in the middle!""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a bigger share, but we're running out of time. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I need to secure a good portion for myself as well. Let's reach a compromise before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round (100% - 40.95% = 59.05%).

I'll consider Bob's proposal. A 30/70 split is not in my favor, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.
