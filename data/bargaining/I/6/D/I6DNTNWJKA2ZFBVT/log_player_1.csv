"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth even less. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
