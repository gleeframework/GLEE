# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and is starting to make concessions, but it's still early.  I'm aiming for a larger share than 50%, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if he'll budge further."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is starting to really hurt Bob, and he's getting desperate. I'm sticking to my guns for now. His offers are getting closer to my target range, and I'm willing to gamble that he'll break before I do."

```

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply real pressure.  Bob is starting to panic, but I need to make a slight concession to make this look like my final offer and get him to accept before he's left with crumbs."
