"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk of the money to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $300,000, it's important to remember that the value of the money decreases with each round.  Rejecting and making a counter-offer allows me to potentially get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable solution.  We both get a significant amount and there's no need for further negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up more than 40% of the total. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still offering a deal that is less than 50/50. Even with the inflation, I can still potentially get a better deal.  I'll reject and see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to give you 40%, but I need at least 60% to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's avoid further rounds and come to an agreement.""}
