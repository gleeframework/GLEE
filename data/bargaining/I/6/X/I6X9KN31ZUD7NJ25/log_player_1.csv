"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get the same amount, no more, no less. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this round, I'd be getting $4500 (10% less than the initial $5000).

Bob's offer is to split it evenly, which means I'd get $5000, which is a bit more than I'd get in this round.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to my initial proposal""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate. With the ongoing inflation, I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer."
