I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept a 50/50 split now.  Inflation means my share will keep shrinking with each round, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything close to this in the future."
