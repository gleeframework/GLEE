"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer to try to get Bob to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but I think we can both do better than that. Let's work together to find a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.

However, Bob's offer is quite one-sided, with him gaining 90% of the total amount. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2, due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This way, we both get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, trying to find a more balanced split."
