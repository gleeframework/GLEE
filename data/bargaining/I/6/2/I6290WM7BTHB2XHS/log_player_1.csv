"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly more aggressive this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm aiming to get a bit more than half of the $100, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's see...

Since Bob's offer is the same as in round 2, and I know that the money is worth less to me now, I'll think about it... But, I'll reject it again.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The stakes are getting higher! Considering the significant inflation, my offer will be even more aggressive this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm trying to get a larger share of the $100, given the decreasing value of the money."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth even less to me now, I'll try to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit more favorable to him, but I'll consider it... and I'll accept this time.
