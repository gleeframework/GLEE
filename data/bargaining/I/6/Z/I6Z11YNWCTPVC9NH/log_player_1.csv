"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than the initial $1,000,000, so I'm looking at a gain of $500,000.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a significant concession from his initial 60-40 split. Considering the inflation effect, I think this is a reasonable offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
