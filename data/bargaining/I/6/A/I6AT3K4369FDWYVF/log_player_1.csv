Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

I'm offering to take 600,000 dollars and leave 400,000 dollars for Bob."

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.
