"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get a good chunk of money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach, let's see if you'll bite! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's aggressive offer, I'll think carefully before responding. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, especially since my share is worth 5% less than in the previous round due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to account for inflation. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, proposing a 55-45 split. I hope Bob will consider this offer and accept it to move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully before responding. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since my share is worth 14.26% less than in the first round due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge. Meet me at 52-48?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much to Bob. I hope this offer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up, let's try to find a more equal split. Meet me at 50-50? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully before responding. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since it's a fair and equal division. At this point, I'd rather get a guaranteed 50% of the remaining value than risk getting a worse deal in future rounds. Let's settle for this compromise!"
