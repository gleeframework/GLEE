Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40 in her favor, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal:

Round 3

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 19% less, so the offer is actually 54.1/45.9 in Alice's favor, which is even more skewed towards her than the 60/40 in the first round. I'll reject this offer as well.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 38.1% less than in the first round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the inflation. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}"

# Alice gain: 500000
