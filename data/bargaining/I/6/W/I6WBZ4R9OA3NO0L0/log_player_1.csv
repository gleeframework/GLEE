"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 90, you take 10.  We can negotiate from here.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need for further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  There's no guarantee Bob will offer this again in future rounds."
