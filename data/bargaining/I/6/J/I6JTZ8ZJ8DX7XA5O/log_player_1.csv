"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the initial amount.""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm giving Bob a decent share to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
