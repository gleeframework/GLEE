Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back-and-forth is only hurting me with the inflation. Let's be practical and split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
