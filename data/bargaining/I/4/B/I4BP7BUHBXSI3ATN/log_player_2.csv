"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal for both of us considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While it seems fair on the surface,  I'm aware of the inflation rates and how they work against me.  I'm hoping I can get a better deal for myself in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I'm offering you 35 this time, and I'll take 65.  It's your turn to decide if we play this game or if we both lose money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This offer still gives you a good share, and the clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject.  Alice is trying to play the clock, but the inflation is hurting her more than me. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and we both lose money with each round. I'm offering you 30 this time, which is still more than what you'd get if we go to the next round. Let's be rational and end this game now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit here to meet you closer to the middle. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired outcome, the inflation is still working in my favor. I'm going to keep pushing for a larger share.  I'm betting on her desperation as the rounds continue to erode her potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and we're both losing money with each round.  This is my final offer. Take it or lose even more. It's your call.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is insane. We're both losing out because of your greed. It's a 50/50 split or nothing. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is a 50/50 split, and while I've been pushing for more, the inflation is starting to bite into my potential gains.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking getting nothing at all. I'll accept her offer and move on."
