"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the time pressure, but let's find a more balanced split. This offer is fairer considering the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. This offer acknowledges the time pressure while being more balanced for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer to an even split, but time is on my side more than his.  I need to hold out for a bit longer to pressure him into a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure.  Let's close this deal and both walk away with something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I am lowering my offer slightly, but still staying above what Bob has been offering.  The combination of a decent offer with the increasing time pressure might be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially considering we're halfway through the rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached the 50/50 split which is dangerous territory for me.  While I could hold out for more, the decreasing value of the money makes it too risky. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, even with the inflation."
