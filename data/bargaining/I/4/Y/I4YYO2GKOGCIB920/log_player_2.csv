"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it seems fair, I can potentially get more by waiting. The inflation hurts Alice more than it hurts me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think this split is fairer, considering the inflation will hurt you more than me in the next round. Let's end this now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right about the inflation, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's compromise. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I still think I could get more, Alice is getting a larger share than in my proposal, and the inflation is starting to hurt more. It's better to take what I can get before it gets worse."
