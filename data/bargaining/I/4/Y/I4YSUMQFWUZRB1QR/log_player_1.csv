"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI have offered Bob $4,500 and I will receive $5,500. I included a message to Bob saying ""Let's split fairly"" to appeal to his sense of fairness and hopefully end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect me more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject this offer since I had offered a better deal to Bob in the previous round and he rejected it. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlso, considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less. This means that in the next round, Bob will be more desperate to reach a deal, so I can try to take advantage of that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I will try to take advantage of Bob's desperation due to the higher inflation rate affecting his gains. I will offer him a slightly worse deal than before, but still try to appeal to his sense of fairness.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal""}\n\n###\n\nI am hoping that Bob will accept this offer, considering that the money he gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, and it will only get worse for him in the next rounds."
