"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, as it's closer to an even division. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if Bob is trying to trick me or not, but I'll play along.

I'll reject this offer. I think 40-60 is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, considering the initial offer was 60-40. I'd like to propose a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 55-45""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving me 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $45. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, let's do 55-45 this time. It's still a fair split, but closer to what I think is right. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if Bob is trying to get me to accept a slightly better offer or if he's just trying to wear me down. I'll think about it...

After considering the offer, I'll reject it. I'm not sure why Bob is still pushing for a 55-45 split, considering I already proposed a 55-45 split in round 3 and he rejected it. I'll propose a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet in the middle, let's do a 50-50 split""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game!"
