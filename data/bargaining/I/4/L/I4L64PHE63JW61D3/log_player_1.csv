"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nHow's that? I offered Bob 40% of the money, which is a reasonable starting point. I also added a friendly message to set a positive tone for the negotiation. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation rate we are facing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because, although the split is indeed 60/40 as he mentioned, the actual value of the money has decreased due to inflation. Considering the 5% decrease in value for me and the 20% decrease for Bob, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split""}\n\nIn this round, I offered Bob a slightly better deal than my initial offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. However, I still made sure to prioritize my own gain, as the inflation rate affects me less than it affects Bob. Let's see how Bob responds!"
