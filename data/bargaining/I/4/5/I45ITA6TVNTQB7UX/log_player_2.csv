"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 4:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the potential loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, the inflation factor makes it a risky proposition. Even if the inflation only affects Bob, it's better to try and negotiate a more balanced deal in the next round."
