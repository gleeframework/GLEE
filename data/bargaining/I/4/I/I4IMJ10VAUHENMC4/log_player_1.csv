Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's compromise at 55/45. It's the best way for us to get something out of this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay Bob, 55/45 it is. Let's end this before we both lose out completely.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is finally moving in the right direction.  Given the rapidly increasing inflation and the limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures we both receive something. Holding out for a better deal at this stage is too risky and could lead to both of us getting nothing."
