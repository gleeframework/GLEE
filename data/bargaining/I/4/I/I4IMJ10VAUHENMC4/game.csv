6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split to start.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I think a 65/35 split is more fair, given the changing value of the money. Let's get this done!",Bob,2,
,,"That's a substantial decrease for me, Bob. Let's try to find a more balanced agreement.",Alice,2,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"I understand the time pressure, Bob, but your offer was too low. How about 57/43? It's a smaller gain for me compared to my initial offer, reflecting the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I'm sticking with my previous offer -  60/40 is a fair compromise considering the inflation. Let's agree to this and move on.,Bob,4,
,,"You're not acknowledging the changing value of the money, Bob. This offer is even worse than your first one! I need to see a more realistic proposal.",Alice,4,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm coming down to 54/46. This acknowledges the inflation but is still fair. Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Time is running out Alice. 60/40 is a fair deal for both of us, let's make this happen!",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Your offer gets worse with every round, even though the money is worth less and less!  I need to see some movement from you or this is going nowhere.",Alice,6,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Okay Bob, last chance. 52/48. Take it or leave it. We both lose if we don't agree now!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's compromise at 55/45. It's the best way for us to get something out of this.",Bob,8,
,,"Okay Bob, 55/45 it is. Let's end this before we both lose out completely.",Alice,8,accept
