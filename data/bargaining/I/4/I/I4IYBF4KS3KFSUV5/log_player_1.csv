"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally""
}
```

I'm making a relatively fair offer to start with, giving myself a slight advantage while still being reasonable. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can end the game quickly, minimizing the loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it more evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}


I've reduced my initial offer to try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob, considering the inflation is starting to take its toll on the money's value."
