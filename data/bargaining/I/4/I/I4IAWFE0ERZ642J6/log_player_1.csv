"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, which is $900,000, and leaves Bob with $100,000. The message is a playful way of saying that I'm making a serious offer, but it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. This offer is more equitable and allows us both to walk away with a significant portion of the money. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 95% of the original amount, which is $427,500.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept the offer.
