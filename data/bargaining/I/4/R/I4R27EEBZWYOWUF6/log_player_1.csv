"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty lopsided offer in Bob's favor. I'd rather not accept it. 

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:
