{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000.  This seems fair to me since the money will be worth less to Bob in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 900000

{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I had proposed. With the inflation, he's losing more than me, so I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement before the money becomes worthless."

I'm lowering my share a little bit, but I'm still taking a larger portion.  The inflation is starting to get really bad for Bob, and I think he'll realize that he needs to accept this offer before he loses even more."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I had proposed.  While the inflation is starting to hurt me more, Bob is losing a much larger percentage of his potential gains.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better deal.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement before the money becomes worthless."

The inflation is starting to get serious now, and I'm worried about getting nothing at all. This is my final attempt to reach a compromise.  I'm lowering my share considerably to see if I can finally reach an agreement with Bob."

{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, as the inflation is hurting me a lot. But Bob is getting almost nothing at this point, and I'm worried that if I reject, we'll both end up with nothing. It's time to take what I can get."
