# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal is not fair, and I believe we can find a better division."

# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Alice's compromise is still not fair, considering the inflation is affecting me more significantly. I'll try to find a better deal."
