"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable for the first round, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to feel the inflation, Alice. I'll take the 60/40 split this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, accepting it means I lose a significant amount of money to inflation. It's a better strategy to hold out and propose a more balanced deal in the next round.  The longer Bob waits, the less appealing his 60/40 split becomes for him due to the inflation working against him too."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic. How about a 55/45 split?  The clock is ticking for both of us.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is hitting you harder than me, Alice. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you 4200. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me.  While 4200 is more than I would get if I accepted his 4000 offer in the next round, it's still a significantly smaller portion than what I originally proposed. It's risky, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  52/48.  Accept it, and we both walk away with something. Reject it, and we both lose."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to lay my cards on the table.  This offer is slightly better for Bob than if he waited for the next round and successfully forced me to accept his 60/40 split in his favor. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I increase the pressure on Bob to settle now.  He's likely feeling the impact of the inflation as well, even if it's not hitting him as hard as me."
