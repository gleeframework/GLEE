"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round. Hmm... I'll take it.
