"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take the majority of the initial amount, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, especially since the money loses value with each round. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing with each round!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a bit more favorable to him than to me, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
