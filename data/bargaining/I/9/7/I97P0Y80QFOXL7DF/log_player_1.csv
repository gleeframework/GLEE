"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  The value depreciates for both of us, so dragging this out only hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
