3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  The value depreciates for both of us, so dragging this out only hurts us both.",Bob,2,

4000.0,6000.0,"Okay, I see you're playing tough. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go lower than 40% for me.  Remember, every round that passes means I lose more value.  Let's end this before we both lose too much.",Alice,3,
