"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! How about I take a bigger share? 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. I'd rather not give up 80% of the remaining money, but I don't want to reject his offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
