"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm taking a risky approach here.  Since the money is worth less to me with each round, I want to maximize my gains right away.  I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take even a small amount, the inflation is working against me.  I need to hold out for a better deal, as I know the money will be worth less to me in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

This time, I'm offering a more substantial share to Bob, 100,000, hoping he'll see it's in his best interest to accept.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I want to get something before the value of the money dwindles further."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still insultingly low.  Even though the inflation is really hurting me now, I can't give in.  I need to hold out for something more reasonable.  I'm starting to get desperate, but I can't afford to panic yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

The pressure is really on now. I'm offering Bob a larger share, 200,000, hoping he'll finally recognize the value of getting something before the money depreciates further.  I'm desperate for a deal, but I still can't afford to give him the majority."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm getting desperate now. I'm offering Bob a significant portion, 300,000, hoping he'll finally see reason.  The inflation is making my potential gains minuscule, and I can't afford to lose everything.  I need to get something before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. The inflation is making my potential gains laughably small, but I have to hold out for a better deal.  There are only a few rounds left.  Maybe Bob will finally be forced to compromise."

# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I can't believe this is happening! Bob is being completely unreasonable.  Even though I'm practically getting nothing, I'm still holding out. There's no way I'm giving in to this ridiculous offer. I have to fight for something, even if it's just a few dollars. The next round is my last chance to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

It's my last chance. I have to offer Bob a fair share, or we both get nothing.  This is a 50/50 split. I'm hoping he sees that it's in his best interest to accept.  The inflation has been brutal, but maybe we can still salvage something from this."
