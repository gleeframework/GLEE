"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is designed to incentivize Bob to accept quickly.  While it's a small amount for him, it's better than nothing if he rejects the offer, as the money will be worth less to him in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money.  The risk of continuing is too high, as Bob is now getting a larger share of the declining value of the money."
