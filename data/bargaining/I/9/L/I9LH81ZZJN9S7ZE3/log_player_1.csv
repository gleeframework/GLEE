"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This offer suggests a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward proposal to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I think I deserve more for taking on the risk of negotiation 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you deserve more for taking on the risk of negotiation? I'm not convinced yet!""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think it's still too skewed in Bob's favor. I'm hoping for a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking on the risk, but I'm still the one who has to live with the outcome. I'm willing to give you a bit less, but not that much less""
}
```

This offer is a slight increase in my share, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still too close to the previous offer, I'm not willing to give you more than 55% of the total""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as it's still not far enough from the previous one, and I think I can do better than a 55/45 split. I'm hoping Bob will make a more substantial concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give you more than 55% of the total. This is my final offer""
}
```

I'm making a slight concession to get closer to the 55/45 split that I mentioned in my previous message. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
