  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
