"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to take 90 dollars, and give 10 dollars to Bob. I am hoping this will be enough to get Bob to accept, as it leaves me with a large share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, it is not worth risking getting nothing at all.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get some money, even if it is less than I hoped for."
