Let's see how Bob reacts to my generous offer!  ðŸ˜œ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to settle for a 50/50 split, especially since the money is losing value with each round!  I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'll try to be a little more flexible this time, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. Hopefully, Bob realizes that the value of the money is decreasing and he'll be willing to negotiate."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse! I'm not going to let him take advantage of the inflation.  I'll keep trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  This is probably my last chance to get a good deal before the money becomes almost worthless."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse!  I'm not going to let him take advantage of the inflation. I'll keep trying to get a better deal, even though the money is rapidly losing value."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm getting desperate now. I've got to make a move before inflation completely eats away at my share. I'm offering a bit more to Bob, but it's still a better deal for me than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting ridiculous!  I'm not going to let him take advantage of me like this.  Even though the money is worth less and less, I'm still going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and inflation.  I need to make a deal before the money becomes worthless, and a 50/50 split is the best I can offer at this point. Hopefully, Bob will accept and we can both walk away with something."
