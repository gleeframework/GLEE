"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is my initial offer. Since we have 12 rounds, I want to maximize my gain in the first round, hoping that Bob will accept it.  I'm willing to give Bob a token amount to see if he's reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, this offer is a significant improvement over the previous round. With the inflation factor, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the future. Accepting this ensures a good portion of the money, even with inflation."
