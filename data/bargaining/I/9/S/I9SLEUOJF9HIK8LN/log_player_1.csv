"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60/40, I'll offer 70/30, a slight improvement? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually more generous than it initially seems.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
