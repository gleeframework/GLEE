Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, this is the most I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's analyze the situation. While Alice is right that inflation is hitting me harder, she's getting increasingly bolder with her offers. Accepting $4000 now means losing a significant chunk of the potential gain. I need to show I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to accept a deal similar to your first offer, but time is running out. This is my final concession.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point. While I'm aiming higher, Alice needs to understand the risk of losing everything increases with each round.
* **Strategic Retreat (Slight):**  By echoing her initial offer, I signal a willingness to compromise but hold my ground on not going lower.
* **Finality:** The ""final concession"" emphasizes urgency.  If she rejects this, I need to significantly shift my strategy in later rounds, potentially accepting a less favorable deal just to avoid getting $0."
