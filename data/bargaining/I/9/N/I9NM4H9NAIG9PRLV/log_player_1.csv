}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."

# Bob's message: Let's try a slightly more balanced split, but I'm still holding out for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $700,000 is worth 5% less than the $800,000 I proposed in Round 1, so it's $700,000 * 0.95 = $665,000.

Bob's gain of $300,000 is worth 20% less than the $200,000 he proposed in Round 1, so it's $300,000 * 0.8 = $240,000.
