"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives me a larger share, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob feels it's unfair.  I'm hoping he accepts, but I'm prepared to make a counter offer if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my share is significantly less than what I proposed, it's still better than what I'd get if I reject the offer.  Considering the inflation, it makes sense to accept and secure some gains."
