Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
