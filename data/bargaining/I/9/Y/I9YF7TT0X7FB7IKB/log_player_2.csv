{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""I think it's more fair to split it 95/5, considering the inflation will make my share much smaller if we keep playing.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise a little bit. Let's split it 85/15. It's a fair deal that respects the inflation, and we can both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000
