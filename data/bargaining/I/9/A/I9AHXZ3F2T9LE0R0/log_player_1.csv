Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to adjust my expectations. Since Bob's offer is 40% of the original amount, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, but with a slightly better ratio for me. However, I'm not convinced it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

However, I still need to think about the long-term consequences of accepting a deal that might not be the best I can get.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is getting more aggressive, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

With the money being worth 30.17% less than the original amount, I'm getting close to the point where accepting a deal might be better than risking it all. However, Bob's offer is still quite far from what I was hoping for.
