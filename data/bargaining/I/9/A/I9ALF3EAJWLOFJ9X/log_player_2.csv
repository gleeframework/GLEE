"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly. 6000 for me and 4000 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm going to need a bigger share for myself.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases for me each round. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like a bigger share, the inflation is starting to affect Alice's gains significantly. It's better to take the guaranteed $4500 than risk losing out on a better deal in the next round."
