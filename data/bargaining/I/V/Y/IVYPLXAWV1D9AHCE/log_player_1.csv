"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and take 90%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the total amount, which is $100,000, and I'll take the remaining 90%, which is $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's turn the tables. I'll take 90% and give you 10% this time. We can keep it fair by alternating who gets the bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables.

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll receive.

I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 100,000 / 0.95 (due to 5% inflation) = 105,263.16
* Bob's gain: 900,000

Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether I want to accept this offer. I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting a smaller share now against the risk of getting an even smaller share in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 20% this time, but I'm expecting a bigger share next round when the money is worth even less for me""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total amount, which is $200,000, and I'll take the remaining 80%, which is $800,000. I'm hoping that next round, the money will be worth even less for me, so I'll be able to negotiate an even better deal."
