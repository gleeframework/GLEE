"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate from there""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting 80% of the $10,000 and Bob getting 20%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping to establish a baseline for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's see if we can do better than the initial offer 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4500 in the first round.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best strategy, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the inflation and tries to maximize my gain."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,

# Bob gain: 4200

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think I've reached a point where it's better to take what I can get rather than risking further negotiation. A 58-42 split is not ideal, but it's better than nothing, and I'll take the $5800."
