"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your share, this is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round costs you more due to inflation. This offer is more generous than it seems. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanism to her advantage. While the offer might seem ""generous"" on the surface, accepting it at this stage would set a bad precedent.  I need to show Alice I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting a fair deal. This offer is a compromise, and it's the last one I'm making above a 50/50 split.  Let's be reasonable and end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking a significant toll on your potential earnings. This offer is better than waiting further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is far from ideal, rejecting it puts me at a severe disadvantage. The inflation rate is eating significantly into my potential gains. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, guarantees a reasonable sum and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
