"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping it will be accepted!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'd rather have a slightly better offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'm not being too generous, indeed...

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 54-46 split, hoping Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive in his offers.

Considering the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is actually a relatively good deal for me, considering the money is worth less than half of what it was initially.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
