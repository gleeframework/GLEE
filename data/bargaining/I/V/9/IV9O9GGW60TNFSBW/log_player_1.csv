"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives Alice a 60% share and Bob a 40% share of the money. It seems like a fair starting point, with Alice getting a slightly larger share due to the higher inflation rate affecting Bob.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob's offer is slightly less advantageous for me than my initial offer, but after the inflation adjustment, it's still a good deal. I'd rather take a slightly smaller share now than risk losing even more if we continue to the next round."
