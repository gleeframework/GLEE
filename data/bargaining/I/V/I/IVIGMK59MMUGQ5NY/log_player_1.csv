Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I want a bit more for myself. Let's see if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not a good deal for me. The inflation is hitting me harder than it's hitting him. I need to get at least 80% to compensate for the inflation. I will reject this offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate, but I need at least 80% to make this worthwhile. This offer reflects the inflation impacting us both. Let's work together to find a solution.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous rounds, and even though I'm taking a big hit from inflation, I need to accept before the value of my share drops even further. While I'd prefer more, 750,000 is a decent amount considering the circumstances. I'm taking a calculated risk here, hoping that the remaining rounds won't lead to a much worse outcome."
