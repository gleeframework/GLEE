I'm starting with a pretty generous offer. I want to secure a good amount for myself while leaving Bob with a small portion.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept a measly $1000, especially with inflation kicking in.  I'll take my chances with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a large chunk to myself, but this time I'm reducing my share slightly to make it more appealing, while still being generous to Bob. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him before the inflation eats away at our gains further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take the lion's share! I'm not going to let him get away with that. Inflation is definitely biting into my potential gains, but I still have a better chance of getting a bigger piece of the pie if I continue to bargain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

Inflation is starting to get serious, but I still believe I can get a decent amount. I'm reducing my share again, offering Bob a larger portion, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take the lion's share, and inflation is hurting my potential earnings.  I'm not giving up yet, though. I'll keep pushing for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is becoming a serious threat, but I'm still aiming for a sizable share.  I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I need to make sure I get a significant amount to justify the risk of further inflation.  Hopefully, Bob sees the value of compromising and accepts my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite skewed in his favor, even though inflation is hurting both of us. I'm not going to give in to his greed just yet. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation is getting out of control, but I'm desperate for a deal. I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option now, given the current situation, and hopefully, Bob will finally agree to it."
