"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a small portion. This is a good starting point as it will be more appealing to Bob than a completely unfair offer, and gives me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, and I have no reason to believe he will make a more favorable offer in the future. I will reject and make my own proposal in the next round."

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable. While the inflation on his side is starting to impact him more significantly, his offer is still not attractive enough for me. I will continue to reject and attempt to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
