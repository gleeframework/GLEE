"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively even split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is now even more skewed towards his gain, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money. Since my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a smaller share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value so rapidly, I'll have to be even more cautious. Bob's offer is still skewed towards his gain, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully. I'll accept Bob's offer.
