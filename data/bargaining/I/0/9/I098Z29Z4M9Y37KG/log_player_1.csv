  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more cautious with the inflation in mind. Here's my response:

```

# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very cautious. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.

Here's my response:

```
{

}
```

I'll try to hold out for a better deal."

  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need to hold on to some value.""
}
```

I'm trying to preserve what little value I have left, but I'm still open to negotiations."
