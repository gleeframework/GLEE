"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of you, Bob. This is to encourage cooperation and ensure that you are motivated to continue playing. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept this offer in the first round, it's crucial to consider the inflation factor. Rejecting the offer gives me a chance to propose a better division in the next round, taking advantage of the decreasing value of the money for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced approach. I propose 75 for me and 25 for you. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can move on to the next round.""}
