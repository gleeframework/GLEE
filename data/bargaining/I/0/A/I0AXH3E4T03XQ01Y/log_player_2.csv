# Alice's message: Even split is not fair considering inflation, I'm still being generous 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting greedier, and I need to hold firm. While the value is decreasing, I still have some leverage as I can reject and make counter offers. Accepting now would set a bad precedent and likely lead to worse offers in the future."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4900,
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""message"": ""Okay, a slight concession. This is fair given the circumstances and allows us both to benefit.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I need to start making concessions to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintain a position where I get something reasonable considering the inflation.  This offer is slightly better for Alice than a straight split but significantly better for me than her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still have the upper hand 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The rounds are getting dangerously close to the deadline, and Alice is clearly aware of the pressure.  While this offer isn't ideal, accepting guarantees I get something rather than risking a complete loss if we run out of rounds."
