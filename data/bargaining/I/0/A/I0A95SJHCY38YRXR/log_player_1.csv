"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 25% for me. How about a 60/40 split? It's still a decent compromise considering the potential inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
