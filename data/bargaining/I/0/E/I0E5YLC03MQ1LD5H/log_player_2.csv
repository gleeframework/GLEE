Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a game of chicken, hoping I'll crack under the pressure of inflation. While my potential gains are decreasing, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than Alice is not in my best interest. I need to hold my ground a bit longer and see if I can push her closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Look, let's stop wasting time. 50/50 is the fairest deal. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is unlikely to agree to anything better than 50/50, especially with the inflation working in her favor.  Offering a 50/50 split makes it clear I'm serious and willing to risk it all for a fair deal. This might be enough to get her to agree before inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. Inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. While 44/56 isn't a good split, it's better than risking getting nothing if Alice continues lowballing me.  She's right, I am getting desperate, and it's time to cut my losses."
