"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, this is a good starting point

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's ""fair"" in the sense of being a simple split, I'm aiming for more. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round, keeping in mind that the money may be worth less then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I still think I can get more, the inflation factor is starting to become a serious concern.  A 50/50 split is a decent outcome, and there's no guarantee Alice will be so generous in future rounds."
