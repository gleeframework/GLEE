"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less. This offer seems slightly more skewed towards Bob's favor, but I'll consider it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal that slightly favors me this time. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the current offer, I think I'll accept it. The difference between 4800 and 5200 is relatively small, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with the money devaluing even more.
