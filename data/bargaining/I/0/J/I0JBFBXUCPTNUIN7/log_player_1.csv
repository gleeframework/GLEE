"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob!""

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start, but I'll try to negotiate a better deal!

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2. His offer is too skewed towards his gain, and I'd like to aim for a more balanced split.
