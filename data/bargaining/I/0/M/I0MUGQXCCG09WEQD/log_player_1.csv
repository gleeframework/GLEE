"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. If he accepts, we can move on to the next round and I'll have a chance to negotiate further."
