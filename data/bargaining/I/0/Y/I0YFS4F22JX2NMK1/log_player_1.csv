"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started. You can propose next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with the majority of the money. The message is a friendly way to start the game and let Bob know that it's his turn next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it down the middle, huh?

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, I'll try to do better than that.""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering I'm the one who made the first offer and took the risk of being rejected. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is now worth 95% of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""You were too soft last round, let's try again.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but still a significant amount. The message is a bit cheeky, trying to psyche Bob out and make him think I'm being more aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being cautious, huh?

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, you got me this time. I guess I was too aggressive.""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, with the money losing value due to inflation, I don't think I can do better than this. I'm willing to take the smaller share of $4,000 rather than risking Bob rejecting my next offer and leaving me with even less."
