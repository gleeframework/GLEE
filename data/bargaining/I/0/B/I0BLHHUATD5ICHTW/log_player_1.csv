"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a fair offer, as I'm taking a significant majority, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to get a bit more than Bob's offer, but still be reasonable. This ensures that I get a decent amount while still offering Bob a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I am losing a significant amount due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal than this in future rounds. Bob's offer is still too low considering the money I am losing with each round. I will reject and try to negotiate a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to try to secure a slightly larger share than the previous round, but still offer Bob a reasonable amount. Inflation is starting to affect my earnings significantly, so I need to get a good deal in this round to avoid losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the substantial inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal than this. While I am losing a lot of value, I'm still hoping to get a larger share. I will reject and try to secure a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

With inflation continuing to bite, I need to make a move that secures a good amount for me. This offer still leaves a decent share for Bob, but it's the best I can offer while trying to make up for the lost value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, I'm losing a massive amount of value due to inflation. Even though Bob's offer is not ideal, it's the best I can realistically expect given the situation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something rather than losing everything to inflation."
