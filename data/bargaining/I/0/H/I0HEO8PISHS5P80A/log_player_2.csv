"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This seems like a fair split to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. It's not fair that Alice gets to keep 60% of the money, and I think we can find a more balanced split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 10% less to me in each round, I'll try to find a compromise that benefits both of us. Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Alice. This split takes into account the decreasing value of money for me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing for you, Bob, so I'm offering a bit less. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not ready to accept this offer yet. Since the money is worth 19% less to me now, I think Alice should be willing to compromise a bit more. I'll proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer. The pressure of the decreasing value might make Alice more willing to find a mutually beneficial split. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. Considering the decreasing value of money for me, I'll try to find a split that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice. Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""The value is dropping fast for me, Alice. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us before it's too late.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, time is running out. I'm offering a 50/50 split. Let's end this and both get something. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think it's time to accept Alice's offer. A 50/50 split seems fair, considering the decreasing value of money for me. If I were to reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the money would be worth even less to me, and I risk getting a worse deal or even nothing at all. I'm willing to settle for this split and get something rather than risking it all. Let's end the game here!"
