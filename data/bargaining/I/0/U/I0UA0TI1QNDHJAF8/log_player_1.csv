Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still confident we can find a more equitable split. I'm willing to increase my share to encourage a quicker resolution. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offers are still not reflecting the impact of inflation on his potential gains.  While he's offering more than before, it's still a bad deal for me in the long run. I need to push him further to recognize the advantage I have due to his shrinking pot."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear time is on my side. I'm offering you 200,000 - take it or leave it.  Every round you delay, the value of what you could have had diminishes.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  It's time to take a firm position. By offering a ""take it or leave it"" deal, I'm signaling I'm not willing to budge much further.
* **Highlighting Inflation:**  Bob needs to understand the severity of the situation. Emphasizing his dwindling potential gains should push him towards a more realistic agreement.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While the message is firm, I am offering slightly more than in Round 3 (700,000). This might be enough to make Bob reconsider and avoid a complete impasse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: While I acknowledge the inflation, I still believe a fairer split is possible. I'm willing to concede a bit more, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that is so heavily skewed in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is finally acknowledging the inflation, but his actions don't match his words.  He's actually offering me *less* than before (Round 4). This indicates he's still not grasping the significant disadvantage he's at.  I need to remain firm and make it clear that lowball offers won't be accepted."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. I'm offering you 250,000.  This is a significant amount of money, even considering the inflation.  If you reject this, I'm prepared to continue to the end, where you'll be left with a fraction of that.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  It's time to draw a line in the sand. By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency.
* **Acknowledging Reality (Slightly):**  While still emphasizing inflation, I'm offering a small concession from Round 5 to show I'm willing to find some middle ground.
* **Strong Warning:**  Bob needs to understand the consequences of continuing. Explicitly mentioning the possibility of him getting a tiny amount if he continues to reject should make him reconsider. 

This strategy balances firmness with a touch of compromise.  It aims to secure a favorable deal while leaving Bob with a (hopefully) acceptable offer he's more likely to take before his potential earnings erode even further."
