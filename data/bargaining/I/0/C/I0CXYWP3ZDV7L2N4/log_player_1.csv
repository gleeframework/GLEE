"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure most of the money. I'll adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and how inflation affects the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is tempting, it's still not worth accepting after Bob's first rejection. He's clearly going for a more aggressive strategy.  I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 80/20. I'm assuming Bob's rejection in round 2 was influenced by the 20% inflation on his share. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing while still securing a large portion of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I wanted more, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of Bob's gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
