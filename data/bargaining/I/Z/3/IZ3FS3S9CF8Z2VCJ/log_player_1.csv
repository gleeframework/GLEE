Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and get as much as possible in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though my share is smaller than my first proposal, it's still a significant amount. I don't want to risk another round, as the inflation will eat away at my potential gain.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, considering the dynamic of the game."
