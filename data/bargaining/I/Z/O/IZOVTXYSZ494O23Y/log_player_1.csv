"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get the same amount, but for Bob, his 50% is worth 20% less than in the first round.

I'll think for a moment... Meeting in the middle sounds like a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
