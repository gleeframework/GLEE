"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $4,800.

Bob's offer in this round is $2,500 for me and $7,500 for him, which is equivalent to $3,000 and $6,000 in the first round's value.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll take it since it's still a decent split.
