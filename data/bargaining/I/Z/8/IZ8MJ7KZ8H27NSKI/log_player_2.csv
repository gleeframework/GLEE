**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time is running out.  We need to apply more pressure and show Alice we're willing to risk it all to get a fair deal. It's a gamble, but with the inflation increasing, we stand to lose more with each passing round anyway."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  50/50 or we both get nothing!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and Alice needs to understand we're serious about a fair division. A firm ultimatum is necessary. This offer is risky, but the potential loss from continued inflation and a failed negotiation outweighs accepting a less-than-fair deal."
