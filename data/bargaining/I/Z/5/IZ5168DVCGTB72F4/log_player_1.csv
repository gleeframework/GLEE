"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start.""}\n\n###\n\nCan you please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the proposal? I'll proceed accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit imbalanced. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Please let me know when I can proceed.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the current value of the money for me is 80% of the original value, which means each dollar is worth $0.80 to me, correct?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll adjust my proposal to ensure I get a fair share. Since each dollar is now worth $0.80 to me, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to compensate for the loss.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 58-42 is a fair split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects this proposal.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, if Bob rejects this proposal, the value of the money for me will decrease by another 20% in the next round, making each dollar worth $0.64, correct?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient option. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'd rather secure $50 worth 51.2% of the original value ($0.512 per dollar) than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease confirm that the game is over and we've reached a mutually agreeable division of the $100.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, the final value I receive is $50, but due to inflation, it's effectively worth $25.60 in terms of the original value, correct?"
