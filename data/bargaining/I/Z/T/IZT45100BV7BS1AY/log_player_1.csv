"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nMy offer is to take $6000 for myself and give Bob $4000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair split, with me taking a bit more. Let me know if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more this time.  We can both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","No, I don't accept this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less in this round, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic about the inflation, I'll take a bit more but still fair""}\n\nMy offer is to take $5800 for myself and give Bob $4200. Considering the inflation, I've adjusted my proposal to still give Bob a fair share, but taking into account the decrease in value. Let me know if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's work together to maximize our gains.  I'm willing to compromise to avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (27.1% less than the first round), I think Bob's offer is reasonable. To avoid further losses, I'll accept this offer and settle for $4500. It's better to secure this amount now rather than risking an even lower value in the next round."
