Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's your money that's losing value, not mine.  I'm being generous by offering a near even split.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm holding firm, but understand the pressure you're under. Let's close this deal - a slight bump for me, but better than the losses you're facing. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are substantial. Accepting Alice's offer results in a slight loss compared to a hypothetical even split in Round 1, but it's better than risking further losses in future rounds. 

Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:**  A 34.39% loss is significant. Waiting further risks even larger losses on my potential gains.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge much:**  Alice consistently aims for a slightly advantageous split. It's improbable she'll drastically change her stance.

While not ideal, accepting minimizes potential losses due to the game's inflation mechanic."
