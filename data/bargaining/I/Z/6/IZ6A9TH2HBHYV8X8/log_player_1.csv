"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount. Your turn to accept or reject! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $9,500 in my mind.

I'm not too thrilled about the 20-80 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
