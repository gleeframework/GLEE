Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering 750k for myself, and 250k for you. It's the best I can do, and it's still a significant amount. Let's reach an agreement before the value of the money drops even further. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While the value is decreasing for me, 250k is a terrible deal. I need to hold out for a better offer, but I also need to be mindful that time is running out.  I'm hoping Bob will start to panic soon and make a more reasonable proposal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a simple even split. 50/50.  Take the deal and let's both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a strong stand and go for a 50/50 split. This emphasizes fairness and puts the pressure back on Bob. With only 5 rounds remaining, he'll have to seriously consider if his stalling tactics are worth risking it all."
