400000.0,600000.0,"Let's flip the script, Alice. I'll take 600k this time, and you get 400k.  It's a fair deal, considering the money is worth less to you with each round. Let's be efficient and finish this now.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate the counter-offer, but let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing 550k for me and 450k for you.  Time is ticking, and the value is decreasing.",Alice,3,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be realistic. I'll take 700k, leaving you with 300k. This is a fair compromise, considering the diminishing value of your share. Let's end this now and both walk away with something.",Bob,4,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm at 520k for me, 480k for you.  Take the deal, it's getting worse for me every round!",Alice,5,

250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering 750k for myself, and 250k for you. It's the best I can do, and it's still a significant amount. Let's reach an agreement before the value of the money drops even further.",Bob,6,
