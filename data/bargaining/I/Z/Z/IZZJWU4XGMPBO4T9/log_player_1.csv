"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and keep the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, with me taking 900,000 dollars and Bob taking 100,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 dollars is actually worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 475,000 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
