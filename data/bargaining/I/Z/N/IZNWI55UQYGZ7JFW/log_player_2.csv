"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70/30. I think it's fair considering the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 3000$ is a good amount, the potential inflation is significant and could erode the value of my share. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the inflation risk. Let's work together to avoid losing too much value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 65/35 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for potential loss of value. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has hurt the value of the money, a 3500$ gain is still better than the potential loss of value if we keep going and the inflation continues to bite. I'll take this offer."
