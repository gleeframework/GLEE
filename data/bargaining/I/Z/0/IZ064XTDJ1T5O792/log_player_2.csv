"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, Alice. How about 60-40?""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for Alice's response.\n\n###\n(Note: I've taken into account that the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round, so I'm trying to get a bit more in this round.)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little, Bob.  How about 55-45? This is a fair deal given the changing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept this offer. Since the money is worth 36% less for me now, getting 45 is actually a better deal than getting 50 in the first round. I don't think I can get a better deal than this in the next rounds, considering the inflation."
