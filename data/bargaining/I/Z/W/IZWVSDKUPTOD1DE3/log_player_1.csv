"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems reasonable given that I'll have the burden of proposing first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting my role as the proposer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my next proposal to account for the inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a chance, Bob. I'll do better than that.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and passing the proposal back to him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still the one taking the risk of proposing.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the inflation, but still trying to get a better share for myself."
