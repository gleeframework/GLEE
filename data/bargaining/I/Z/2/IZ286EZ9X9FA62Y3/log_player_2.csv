"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it in a way that I get a bit more, since I made the first offer 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's not a very fair offer, Alice! I'm willing to negotiate, but I deserve a much larger share than that.  Let's see what you offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think it's more than fair to split it this way considering you get to make the next offer with the money decreasing in value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think I'm being generous with this offer, let's settle on this before the money loses more value 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is barely an improvement over her first offer, even considering the inflation. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage. I need to hold firm and show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and the money is losing value. This is a fair offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's end this before we both lose 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous!  Alice is clearly not negotiating in good faith. Her offer barely budged, and the value keeps dropping. I need to stand my ground and hope she starts taking this seriously soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm giving you a chance to take a decent amount, but this is my final offer.  If you reject it, I'm going to start playing hardball.""
}
