  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is already getting less valuable, and Bob's offer is trying to take advantage of that.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping it will be more generous!"

Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of the money, Bob's offer is looking less appealing. I'll reject it and try to get a better deal:
