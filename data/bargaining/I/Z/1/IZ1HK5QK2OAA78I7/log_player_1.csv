"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth 20% less this round, $6,000 is actually 80% of the original $7,500 I would have gotten in the first round, so I'm not getting a worse deal than before.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
