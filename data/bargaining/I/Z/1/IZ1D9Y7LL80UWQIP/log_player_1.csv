"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split.  It's a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will find it reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a 70/30 split.  While inflation has hit, I still believe this is a fair deal given his initial proposal.  I'm hoping he'll see that compromise is necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has taken a significant bite out of the value of the money, accepting this offer means I still gain something. It's not ideal, but given the trajectory of the game and the risk of getting nothing, I believe it's the best move."
