This is a fair offer, and I believe it will be accepted."

I am offering a slightly better deal for Bob than the previous round, hoping to incentivize him to accept. I am still getting a fair share, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 6500

I'm still hopeful to get a better deal. The inflation is significant now, but I'm not ready to accept such a low offer yet."

I'm offering a compromise. This offer is slightly lower for me than my previous one but still better than Bob's last proposal. I believe this could be a good point to end the game and avoid further inflation."
