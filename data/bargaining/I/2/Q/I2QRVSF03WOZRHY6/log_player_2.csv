Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is quite generous. Think twice before rejecting it. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the money is losing value for me. I'm offering a 52/48 split. This is my final offer above 50%.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer above 50%, but I'm still not convinced. This is my counteroffer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the effects of inflation are really starting to hurt. While not ideal, getting $430,000 is better than risking another round and potentially getting even less. It's time to cut my losses and accept Alice's offer.
