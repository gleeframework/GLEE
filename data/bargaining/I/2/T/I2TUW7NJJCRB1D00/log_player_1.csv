"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. My message to Bob is that I'm trying to split the money fairly, giving him 40% of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 80% share for Bob, especially since my gain would be worth $2,000 now. I'd like to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""50/50 split, no negotiations, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, with no room for negotiations."
