"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to get a better share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the previous offers and the inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60/40, I'll try to get a better share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable split."
