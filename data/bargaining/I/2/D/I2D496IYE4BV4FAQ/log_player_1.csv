"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This is a starting offer that favors Alice slightly, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get the game over in the first round, but I'm prepared for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is fair, and it's a better deal for me than waiting another round and facing another 10% inflation penalty."
