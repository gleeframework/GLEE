Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise to get this done.  Inflation is impacting us both, let's end this now while we can still walk away with a decent share.

# Alice gain: 560000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aiming for a 60/40 split in her favor, trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me more severely.  I need to hold firm to get a better deal, but I need to be mindful that time is running out and my potential gains are decreasing rapidly."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Let's end this now before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time to play hardball.  Alice is unlikely to accept anything less than a 60/40 split in her favor, but I can't afford to go much lower either.  A 50/50 split, while not ideal, is the fairest option and the most likely to get her to agree before the effects of inflation become too detrimental.  This offer sends a clear message that I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to risk it all if necessary."
