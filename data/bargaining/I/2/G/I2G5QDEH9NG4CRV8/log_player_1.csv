Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to accept the offer and end the game quickly."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give away too much too soon. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The reduced value of the money means I need to aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and I need to adjust my strategy. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're being stingy, Bob! I'm willing to compromise to move forward.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 20% reduction from my initial offer, and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a gentle jab to encourage Bob to reconsider his strategy."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give away too much more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my decision-making. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a meeting-in-the-middle approach, the reduced value of the money means I need to aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss. I'm not convinced that $450,000 is enough for me, considering the erosion of purchasing power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really hitting hard now! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob. I need to take a bigger share to keep up with the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, and keeping $550,000 for myself. The message is a warning to Bob that I'm not going to settle for a low share anymore, given the erosion of the money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling the value of the money now! Considering the drastic reduction in the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's 50/50 offer. Given the extreme inflation, I think this is a fair compromise, and I'd rather split the remaining value of the money evenly than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come."
