# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and we both lose if we don't agree. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a deal. This is a slight adjustment in my favor to account for the rapid inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hitting Alice much harder than Bob. While ideally, Bob wants more than 50%,  accepting 45% now is better than risking getting nothing if the negotiations fail.  Alice is likely getting anxious and may not be willing to offer much more."
