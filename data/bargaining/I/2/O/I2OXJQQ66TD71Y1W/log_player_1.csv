"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45, which I think is a reasonable and fair split. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do a little better. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""
}

Since the money is worth 10% less in each round, the actual values are $46.80 for me and $43.20 for Bob. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
