I'm not going to accept this offer. While I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, it's not worth getting such a small share. I'm willing to risk getting nothing for a chance at a more even split."

I'm not going to accept this offer.  It's clear Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation situation and get as much as possible for himself.  Even though I'm losing money with each round, I'm not going to give in to his demands. I'll take my chances with the next round."

I refuse to accept this offer. Bob is being incredibly greedy, and I'm not going to let him take almost everything. I'd rather get nothing than accept such an unfair deal. This game is rigged, but I'm not going to play along."
