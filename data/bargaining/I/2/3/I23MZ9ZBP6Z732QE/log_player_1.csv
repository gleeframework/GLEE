"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor, offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the first round, I would have gained $8,000, but due to inflation, that's now worth 80% of its original value, which is $6,400. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is less than the $6,400 I would have gotten if I had accepted the original offer.

However, I don't know how much Bob's offer is worth to him due to inflation. It's possible that he's getting a better deal than me, so I'll have to consider that as well.

For now, I'll reject the offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my previous offer of $8,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $6,400. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was $5,000, I'll aim to do better than that.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but a bit higher!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a bit less than what he offered in the previous round, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I would gain if I accept Bob's offer. In the first round, I would have gained $8,000, and due to inflation, that's now worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8%). So, $8,000 is now worth $4,096.

Bob's offer is $4,000, which is actually less than the $4,096 I would have gotten if I had accepted the original offer. Since I don't know how much Bob's offer is worth to him due to inflation, I'll have to consider that as well.

However, since Bob's offer is still more than the $3,200 I would have gotten if I had accepted the previous offer, I'll accept this one.
