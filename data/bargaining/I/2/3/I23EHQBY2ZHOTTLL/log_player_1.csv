"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my share, now it's my turn to propose a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll consider the new amounts as follows:

* Alice gain: $8,000 x 0.95 = $7,600
* Bob gain: $2,000 x 0.95 = $1,900

Bob's new offer is:

* Alice gain: $4,000
* Bob gain: $6,000

I'll accept this offer.
