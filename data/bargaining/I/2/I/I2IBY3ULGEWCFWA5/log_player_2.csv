Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  But we're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the bigger share to compensate for the inflation I've already taken on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
