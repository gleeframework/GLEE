"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a slightly greedy approach, aiming to get 90% of the money. This should encourage Bob to accept, but if he rejects, I'll have a chance to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, Bob's offer is a fair split considering the inflation.  Accepting ensures I get something, and it's unlikely the next round would yield a significantly better outcome."
