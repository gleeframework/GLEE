"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I'm aiming for the majority of the money. I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. This is a significant advantage for me, but it's also a reasonable starting point that Bob might consider accepting. 

**Let's see what Bob decides!**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is significantly better for him than my initial offer was for me. I'm not willing to accept such a large loss. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm taking into account the inflation, but I'm also considering that Bob might be getting a bit greedy. I'm reducing my offer from $900,000 to $700,000, but this is still a good deal for me. 

I'm hoping that Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer, as there's no guarantee that he'll get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is much closer to a 50/50 split than the previous round.  Even with the significant inflation hitting my gains, this is a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I receive a decent amount of money, especially considering the risk of further inflation and potential worse offers in the future."
