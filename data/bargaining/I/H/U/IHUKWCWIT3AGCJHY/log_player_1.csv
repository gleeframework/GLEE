"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll get the smaller share, you get the bigger one.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly.  Let's call it a 60-40 split in my favor this time, as you had the higher share last round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think it's fair that Bob is trying to dictate the split again, and this time in his favor. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time. Let's see if you'll accept it.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money."
