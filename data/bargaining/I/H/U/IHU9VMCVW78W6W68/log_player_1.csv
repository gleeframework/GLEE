I'm making a big move this round. I'm increasing my offer for Bob to $10,000.  We are getting very close to the end of the game, and I'm willing to give up a bit more to hopefully secure a deal. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the fact that we're both getting closer to a potential loss if we don't come to an agreement."
