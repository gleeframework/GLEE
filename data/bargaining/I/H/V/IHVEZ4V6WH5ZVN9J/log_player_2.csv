"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair-ish split.  I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think we can work something better out in the future if we keep playing.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but it's not a sustainable split for me. How about we try something more equitable this round?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to go down to a 60/40 split, but I won't go any lower.  We have a lot of rounds left, so we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's important to remember that she's not losing any value from the money with each round, while Bob is. Holding out for a better offer, even with the inflation, is the stronger strategic play."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a balance quickly.  I'm willing to be flexible, but this split needs to reflect the fact that time is literally money for me in this game. Let's make a deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at a 50/50 split.  This is a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally offering a fair split. While it's unfortunate that the inflation has eaten into the potential gains, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option.  Continuing to play risks getting nothing at all, which is a worse outcome than accepting a slightly smaller share now."
