"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be greedy Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

With inflation kicking in, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's a decent amount, and I'm ready to take it."
