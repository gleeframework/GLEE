Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting is better than rejecting at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. By round 5, my potential offer will be worth even less.
* **Bob's Stance:** His ""final offer"" message suggests he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting means risking getting a worse deal in a future round where the money is worth significantly less.

Accepting now secures $450,000, which is better than the potential for a much lower amount later."
