"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```

  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced you're worth more. I'll make a new offer.""
}

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers.

Considering the effects of inflation, I need to be careful not to give up too much. However, I also don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

Considering the severe effects of inflation, I'm facing a significant reduction in the value of the money I'll receive. However, I also don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value.
