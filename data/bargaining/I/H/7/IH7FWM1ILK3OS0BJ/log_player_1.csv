"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900k to 100k split. This is a generous offer that accounts for the potential for inflation while still leaving a significant amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
