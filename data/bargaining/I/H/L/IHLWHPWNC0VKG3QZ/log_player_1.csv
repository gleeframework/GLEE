"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% of the initial amount, and you can have 10%. It's a fair starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm taking a relatively large share initially to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's start with a balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since my gain is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. How about I take 60% and you take 40%?""
}
```

I'm trying to increase my share, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing for more, but I'm not budging. This is my counteroffer, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my gain, I need to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 25/75 split, especially since my gain is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,

  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I think I can do better than 30%. How about I take 45% and you take 55%?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much ground."
