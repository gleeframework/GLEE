"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20 dollars, and I'll take 80 dollars. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split is a good start, but I think we can do better. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to try to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I'd like to get a bit more. Can you give me a bit more, say 55 dollars?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%). I'll keep that in mind when making my next offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I still think 60 dollars is a fair share. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I think 30 is a good compromise. You're getting a bigger share, and I'm still getting a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%). Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure I want to give him 30 dollars. I'd like to try to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to get a bit more. Can you give me 35 dollars?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 64.91% of what it was in the first round (72.9% of 90% = 65.61%, rounded to 64.91%). I'll keep that in mind when making my next offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 42 dollars is a fair share. You're getting a decent amount, and I'm still getting a significant portion.""
