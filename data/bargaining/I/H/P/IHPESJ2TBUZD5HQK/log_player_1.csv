Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. Your share is losing value much faster than mine. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. Take this offer while it's still good. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
