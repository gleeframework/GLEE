"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 55/45 split seems reasonable for a starting point. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. A 55/45 split isn't too bad, but I'm willing to take a risk to try and get a bit more. Plus, the inflation rate isn't too high yet, so I don't feel too much pressure to accept this offer right away. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's try a 52/48 split. I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation rate will affect me more as the rounds go on.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but I need a bit more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at 53/47? 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nA 53/47 split is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not satisfied. Considering the inflation rate is starting to take a toll on my potential gains, I want to try and get a better deal. I'll take the risk and see what happens in the next round. Maybe Alice will be willing to compromise a bit more. Let's see what she comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more, considering the inflation rate is affecting me. How about a 51/49 split? I think this is a fair deal, given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. I'm willing to come down slightly to 52/48.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation rate is taking a significant toll on my potential gains, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. A 52/48 split isn't ideal, but it's better than risking further losses due to inflation. I've managed to get Alice to come down slightly, and I don't think I'll be able to negotiate a better deal at this point. It's time to take the money and run!"
