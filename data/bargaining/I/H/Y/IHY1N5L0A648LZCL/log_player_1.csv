Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it. I figure 900k is a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer.  I'll reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still leaving a significant portion for Bob. I'm hoping he'll recognize that continuing to reject offers will lead to a much worse outcome for him in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than his previous one!  I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm going to keep rejecting until I get something closer to what I want.  While my gains have been reduced by inflation, I know that if we keep going, Bob's will be reduced even further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of offering a decent amount to Bob, hoping he'll see the value in accepting rather than risk getting even less in the future. This is a lower offer than my last, but inflation is impacting me more severely, and I still believe it's a fair split."
