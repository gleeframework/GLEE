Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. I've included a message saying ""Let's divide fairly"" to try to persuade him to accept my offer. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more balanced, and I'm willing to be flexible for a quick decision. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less in this round, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that benefits me more. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation and the previous offers, I'm proposing a division where I get $525,000 and Bob gets $475,000. My message ""Let's meet in the middle"" aims to convey that this offer is a compromise between our previous proposals, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair deal and accept it."
