Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and then discuss further."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a generous offer, I'm offering a slightly more skewed split this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thank you for the updated offer.

Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 5% less than my initial offer of $600,000, which is $570,000.

I'm not thrilled about the skewed split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."

}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to try to meet Bob in the middle, while still keeping a significant portion of the money."
