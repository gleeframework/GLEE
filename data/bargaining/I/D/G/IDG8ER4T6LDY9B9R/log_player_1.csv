I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point considering I'm the one making the initial offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept a 10/90 split. I'll wait until next round to make a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 640000, ""bob_gain"": 360000}

I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a decent share of the money. This offer gives Bob a good amount, but I'm taking the majority. Let's see if this is more appealing than the previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation. I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 512000, ""bob_gain"": 488000}

I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to get at least half of the money. This offer gives Bob a good amount while still giving me the majority. Let's see if this is more appealing."
