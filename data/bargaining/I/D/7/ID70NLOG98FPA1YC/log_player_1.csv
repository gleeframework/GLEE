Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. It's a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the inflation hurts, Bob's offer is still the best I've seen, and I can't guarantee a better offer in the next round."
