"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $400,000, a fair share. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total, and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  I'll take $550000, leaving you with $450000. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less after the first round, Bob's offer is actually a good one for me. I'll accept it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
