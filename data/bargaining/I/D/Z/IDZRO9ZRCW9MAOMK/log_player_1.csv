"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, Alice. It's a fair and simple proposal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it 50/50 just yet. I'd like to negotiate further."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, trying to inch closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him. It's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value."
