Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, this is the final offer. Take it or leave it. You're losing more each round, and I'm being more than fair. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but I still have some leverage. While the inflation is hurting, getting less than half is unacceptable. I need to show some backbone or risk getting a worse deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, stop being stubborn. You've rejected my previous offers which were more than generous.  This is my final offer. Take it and let's end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the Tables:** Alice is using time pressure against me. It's time to turn the tables and apply some pressure myself, calling her out on being ""stubborn"".
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency.  
* **Slight Concession:** I'm moving a little closer to her offer, but still maintaining a position of strength. 

It's a gamble, but at this stage, a strong stance is needed to avoid getting pushed into a corner."
