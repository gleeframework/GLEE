"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the risk of inflation. Let's work together to get a good deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
