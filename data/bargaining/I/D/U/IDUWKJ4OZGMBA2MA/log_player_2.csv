"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me. By round 12, my $400,000 will be worth significantly less. I need to push for a larger share in the early rounds to capitalize on the inflation disparity."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, so I'm proposing a split that heavily favors me in the early rounds.  Let's be practical and avoid lengthy negotiations."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Understandable:** This offer significantly favors Bob, reflecting the inflation advantage. However, the message acknowledges Alice's position and frames the offer as a way to expedite the process.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 11 rounds left, putting a time pressure element on Alice could encourage her to accept a less favorable deal rather than risk getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on both of us, let's find a middle ground to secure our gains 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, but it's still not favorable enough for me. The inflation is hitting hard, but I need to hold my ground for a little longer to secure a better deal.  Alice's message suggests she's feeling the pressure, which is a good sign for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer is a compromise - it gives me a slight edge, reflecting the early inflation, but ensures you get a significant amount.  Let's be done with this!"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Bob is lowering his demand slightly from 650,000 to 600,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Urgency:** Emphasizing the dwindling rounds (""running out of time"") increases the pressure on Alice.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  The message highlights the offer as a compromise that benefits both parties, potentially making it more palatable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value, let's meet closer to the middle to cut our losses 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer, but the deal is still not favorable enough given the faster rate of inflation on my end. While we're both losing money, I stand to lose significantly more if I accept a deal heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept anything below a certain threshold."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a win-win here. This offer reflects the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable deal. Let's end this before our gains shrink any further!"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is reducing his ask to $550,000, showing movement towards the middle ground.
* **Justification:** The message clearly connects the offer to the time pressure (inflation) and emphasizes mutual benefit.
* **Finality:**  The language suggests this is Bob's final offer, adding urgency for Alice to accept. 

At this stage, Bob is balancing his desire for a larger share with the increasing risk of walking away with nothing. This offer maintains a slight advantage for Bob given the inflation disparity but significantly increases the likelihood of a deal."
