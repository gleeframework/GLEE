"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Don't wait for it to lose more value 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my potential gains are decreasing, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than 50% isn't rational.  I need to show firmness, hoping she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This is a serious offer, Alice.  We're both losing out with every passing round. Let's be reasonable and end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly lowering my demand to show some flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a reasonably fair split.  The message aims to convey urgency and the need for a compromise.  Hopefully, Alice will see this as a sign of good faith and accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, literally 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's taunting message and increasingly imbalanced offers suggest she's willing to push this to the brink.  However, accepting a deal where I get 43% after inflation is a terrible outcome. It's better to hold out hope that she'll start proposing more reasonable splits as we approach the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 47,
""alice_gain"": 53,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a reasonable compromise.  Let's end this before we both get nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm reducing my demand slightly again to signal some flexibility and a genuine desire to settle. 
* **Urgency:**  With each round, the potential gains shrink. The message emphasizes the risk of walking away with nothing if this continues.
* **Final Push:** This offer, combined with the strong message, might be enough to convince Alice to settle before the stakes are too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

The situation is getting critical, but I'm not desperate yet. Accepting 44% now would mean losing over half the value due to inflation.  Alice's offer is still too greedy, and there's a chance she'll panic and propose a better deal as we approach the final rounds. I need to hold my ground a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  We're down to the wire, and getting nothing helps neither of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:**  We're entering the endgame. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and shifting the power dynamic. Alice no longer has many rounds to exploit my diminishing returns.
* **Acceptable Loss:** While 45% after inflation isn't ideal, it's better than the risk of getting zero if we fail to reach an agreement. 
* **Ultimatum:** The ""take it or leave it"" language, while risky, emphasizes the seriousness of the situation. Alice needs to understand that I'm not bluffing; I'm prepared to walk away with nothing if she continues to be unreasonable."
