"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to secure most of the money, but I'm also aware that Bob could reject this offer and propose a different split in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation factor is a risk.  Accepting this offer guarantees me $5,000, and if I reject it, there's no guarantee I'll get anything in the next round."
