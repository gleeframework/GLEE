Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're leaving me no choice.  This is my final offer above 800,000.  Take it now, or I'm aiming for the maximum in the later rounds. Don't let greed cloud your judgment; inflation is your real opponent here. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but she's clearly feeling the pressure.  She's threatening to go for a much larger share, which means my offers are having an impact.  While 18.55% inflation hurts, accepting a paltry $150,000 would be a mistake.  There's still room to negotiate, and I'm betting Alice will break before I do."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is getting us nowhere. I'm serious about getting a fair share. Here's a compromise. It's less than my last offer but still a strong deal for both of us. Let's be done with this."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  Alice is getting more aggressive, but so am I. Lowering my demand slightly shows flexibility but keeps the pressure on her.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  I need to acknowledge that time is working against me with each passing round. A slightly faster concession may encourage Alice to settle.
* **Avoiding a Standoff:**  While I believe I have the stronger position, pushing Alice too far risks a stalemate where we both lose.  This offer aims for a balance between firmness and practicality."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it.  My offer stands. It's clear you're aiming for a 60/40 split, but with each round, inflation eats away at your potential gain.  This is your last chance for a sizable share. Don't be stubborn to your detriment. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to back me into a corner, but her strategy is transparent. She's betting I'll panic as inflation rises and accept a bad deal. However, her ""take it or leave it"" approach reveals she's unwilling to move much further. 

Here's why rejecting is still the best play:

* **Calling Her Bluff:** Alice is unlikely to let the entire deal collapse over a 20/80 split, especially since she knows I'm aware of the inflation factor. 
* **Time Still on My Side:**  While 26.49% inflation stings, I have five rounds left.  The pressure is mounting on Alice, too.
* **Maintaining Credibility:** Accepting now would signal desperation. I need to show Alice I'm willing to risk it all to secure a fairer split."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's time to be realistic.  I'm dropping my offer slightly once again to show I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be bullied. Take this deal, or we both risk walking away with nothing. The clock is ticking.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Lowering my demand to 55% shows flexibility and puts the onus on Alice. It's a small concession that signals a desire to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Increased Urgency:** Highlighting the shrinking pot due to inflation emphasizes the need for a decision *now*.  The message is clear:  time is running out for both of us.
* **Final Push:** This offer is designed to be my last significant move.  It suggests I'm nearing my bottom line and won't go much lower. This creates pressure for Alice to accept before I potentially withdraw the offer altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're not negotiating in good faith. This is my final offer. Take it, or we both lose everything. Your stubbornness has cost you dearly already, don't let it cost you everything. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly bluffing. She's trying to use intimidation and the pressure of inflation to force me into accepting a ridiculously small amount. She knows that if I reject this offer, I'm seriously considering walking away with nothing, and she's banking on me being too risk-averse to call her bluff.

However, accepting this offer sets a terrible precedent. It signals to Alice that I'm willing to fold under pressure and accept any offer, no matter how unfair. It's much better to walk away with nothing than to be taken advantage of like this. 

I'm betting Alice will crack before the final round and make a more reasonable offer. If not, I'm prepared to accept the consequences of my actions."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split to end this charade.  Accept this and we both get something.  Reject it, and we'll both walk away empty-handed. It's your call.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  After Alice's absurd offer, it's clear she's not interested in a reasonable negotiation. This 50/50 split is my final offer,  a firm line in the sand. 
* **Ultimatum Time:** I'm making it clear that this is it. No more back and forth.  She either accepts a fair deal or we both lose. The ball is entirely in her court now.
* **Potential for Regret:** While there's a risk Alice will call my bluff, offering anything less than 50% at this point would be a complete capitulation. It's better to walk away knowing I stuck to my principles, even if it means getting nothing."
