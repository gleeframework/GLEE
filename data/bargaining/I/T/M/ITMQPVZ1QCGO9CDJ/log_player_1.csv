"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the current offer
Bob's offer gives me $45, and due to inflation, this amount is worth 5% less than in the first round. So, the actual value I get is $45 * 0.95 = $42.75.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on future rounds
In each subsequent round, the value of the money will decrease by 5% for me and 10% for Bob. This means that if I reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, the total value of the money will decrease, but Bob will be more incentivized to accept my offer since his share will be worth even less.

### Step 3: Determine the best course of action
Given the current offer and the impact of inflation, I should reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Since the value of the money decreases more significantly for Bob, he will be more likely to accept my next offer.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Calculate the actual value of the money for both players
Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less. So, the actual value of the money for me is $100 * 0.95^2 = $90.25, and for Bob, it's $100 * 0.9^2 = $81.

### Step 2: Determine a fair offer considering the impact of inflation
Since Bob is more affected by inflation, I should make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for him. A fair offer would be to give Bob a slightly higher share than in the previous round, but still less than half of the total amount.

### Step 3: Create the offer
I will offer Bob $48, which is a slightly higher share than in the previous round, and I will take $52. The message will be ""Let's split the difference!"".


The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference!""}"
