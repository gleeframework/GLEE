"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that suggests I'm being somewhat generous, but also taking a bit more for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be a bit more even-handed this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""
}
```

I'm taking into account that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 36% less than the original value, and trying to find a compromise that is closer to the middle, while still slightly favoring myself. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
