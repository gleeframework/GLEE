"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to get the game started, and I'll take the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need for negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's see... Meeting in the middle is a fair proposal, but I was hoping to get a bit more. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to consider the reduced value. I'll accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
