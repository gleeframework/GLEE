"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice. Let's split the money more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to get a better deal, but I'm not going to fall for it. His offer is actually worse for me than the previous one!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Since Bob's offer was worse for me, I'll try to make a better one. I'll offer him a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This inflation is getting out of hand, and I need a better deal to make this worth it for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! Bob's offer is still a bit better for him than my previous one, but I'm not sure if it's good enough.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer now that I've seen Bob's previous one. I'll offer him a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount.
