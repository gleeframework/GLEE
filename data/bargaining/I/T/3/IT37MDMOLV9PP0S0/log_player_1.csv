"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, now it's your turn to be fair! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll analyze the offer:

* I'd gain $5,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer of $8,000.
* Bob would gain $5,000, which is 50% of the remaining amount, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 20% less than in the previous round.

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll decide to reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to take a slightly larger share, considering the inflation factor. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted to be fair, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining amount, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a reward for taking on the risk of inflation, to see if Bob will accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you deserve more for taking the risk of inflation? I'll give you a smaller share, but still a decent one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation factor to gain more.

I'll analyze the offer:

* I'd gain $4,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer of $6,000.
* Bob would gain $6,000, which is 60% of the remaining amount, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 48.8% less than in the first round. However, considering the current value, it's a substantial amount.

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll decide to reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to take an even larger share, considering the inflation factor. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not going to let you have all the fun! I'll take a bigger share this time.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining amount, leaving Bob with 30%. I'm framing it as a counter to Bob's previous offer, to see if he'll accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'll take advantage of your greed! I'll take the bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me again!

I'll analyze the offer:

* I'd gain $2,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer of $7,000.
* Bob would gain $8,000, which is 80% of the remaining amount, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 67.23% less than in the first round. However, considering the current value, it's a substantial amount.

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll decide to reject it and try to negotiate further.

However, I should note that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I need to be careful not to leave too little for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80/20, I'll try to take a smaller share to make the division more balanced. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, Bob. I'll take a smaller share this time, but I still want to be fair.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining amount, leaving Bob with 45%. I'm framing it as a compromise, to see if Bob will accept or counteroffer."
