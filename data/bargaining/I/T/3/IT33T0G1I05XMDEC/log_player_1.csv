"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I've also included a friendly message to try to set a positive tone for the negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split it 60/40 in my favor, given the inflation rates we're dealing with. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, especially since the money is worth 20% less to me now. I think I can get a better deal. My decision is:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round and try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nI'm hoping Bob will see the logic in my proposal and accept it. The message is brief and to the point, emphasizing the impact of inflation on the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
