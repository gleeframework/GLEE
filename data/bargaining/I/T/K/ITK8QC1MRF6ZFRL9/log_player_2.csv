"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my last offer before the money shrinks significantly for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### I think this is a reasonable offer, considering the effects of inflation. I'll take the 4200 dollars.\n\n### 

(Remember, I'm just playing the game according to the rules. In a real-world scenario, you should consider your personal financial situation and goals before making any decisions about money.)"
