"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, considering I was already offered 60% in the first round and rejected it. I'd like to make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll think of a new offer for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less now, I'll make a new offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the initial offer. Let's try this.""}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45."
