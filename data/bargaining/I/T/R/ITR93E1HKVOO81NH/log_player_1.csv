"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round. Since I don't know how Bob will react to the inflation, I'm being aggressive.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's a 50/50 split, I know I can likely get a better deal. I'll be the one making the offer in the next round and will try to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and get a larger share again.  Since Bob seems unwilling to accept a lopsided deal, I'm going to offer him a bit more than last time, but still keeping a significant chunk of the money for myself.  We're getting closer to the end of the game, and I don't want to risk getting nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. Even though Bob is getting a larger share than before, the inflation is starting to bite into his gains. If I reject this offer, I risk getting nothing.  I'm willing to accept a slightly lower share than what I was aiming for in the earlier rounds."
