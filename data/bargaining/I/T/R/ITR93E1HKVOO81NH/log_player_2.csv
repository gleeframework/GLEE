This is a very unfair offer!  Bob should reject this and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 3000 is a better offer than 1000, I'm still not convinced it's fair.  The value of the money I receive is decreasing with each round, so I'm going to stick with my initial strategy and try to get a more equitable share."
