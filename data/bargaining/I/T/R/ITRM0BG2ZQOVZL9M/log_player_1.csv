"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, but I'm also leaving the door open for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering a more balanced 55/45, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4500 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 55/45 split, but I'm willing to make a counteroffer. Can we meet at 52/48?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal. Can we meet at 52/48?""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split in my favor, while still leaving room for negotiation."
