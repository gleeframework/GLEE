"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given that you get to keep more money in the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'd rather not accept a 60/40 split, especially since I'll be getting less value out of my share due to inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll on my potential earnings, I'll aim for a higher share in this round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly higher share now to compensate for the decreasing value of money in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 70/30 split this time. I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share than last round, but I need a better deal to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit on my potential earnings now. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, especially since my gain is worth significantly less due to inflation.

I'll think carefully before making a decision...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at my potential earnings, I'll aim for a higher share in this round to try to make up for the losses. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk by offering a higher share, but I need to make up for the decreasing value of my future earnings.""
