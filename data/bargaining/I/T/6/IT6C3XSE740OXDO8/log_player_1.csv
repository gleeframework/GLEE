"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining amount later!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to accept my offer and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $400,000 and call it a day!"
