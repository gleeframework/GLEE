"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slight adjustment to account for the fact that I'm the one making the offer this time. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking into account the inflation effect, I'll consider the effective values of the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, the effective value of my share is 48 * 0.64 = 30.72. The effective value of Alice's share is 52 * 0.9091 = 47.27. 

Given that the initial offer was 40/60, and considering the effective values, this offer seems more favorable to me. I'll accept it.
