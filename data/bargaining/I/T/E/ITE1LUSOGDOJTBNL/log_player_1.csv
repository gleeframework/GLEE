"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering Bob 40% of the original 100$. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

After considering the inflation effect, I'll decide to:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision, but I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is taking its toll! Here's my new offer, taking into account the 5% decrease in value:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```
I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but still hoping Bob will accept!"
