"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. It's a fair and reasonable split, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the continued inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to reach a fair agreement this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on the value of the money. Considering the reduced value, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the continued inflation, my proposal for Round 5 is:

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving in to Bob's demands."
