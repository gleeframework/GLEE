"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the inflation is hurting, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to finalize this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take it or leave it 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds. Alice is clearly playing hardball, and waiting any longer is too risky."
