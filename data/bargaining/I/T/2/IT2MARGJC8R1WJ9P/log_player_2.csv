"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'll reject this offer.  It's not fair to me. I'd like to see a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  It's a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation. How about 60/40? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer an even split, I'm willing to accept this offer. I'm not sure how inflation is affecting Alice, but it's better than risking a worse outcome later."
