"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very risky move, as I'm offering Bob almost nothing.  However, I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to take a tiny bit than nothing at all, especially considering the inflation factor. If he rejects this offer, he'll be the one making the next proposal, and I'll have to see what he comes up with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get a larger share, it's better to take a guaranteed 500,000 now, knowing that inflation could diminish the value of future offers. I don't know how much the inflation is impacting Bob, so accepting this offer seems like the safest choice."
