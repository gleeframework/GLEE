"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This is a generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial $700,000 is now worth $560,000. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, taking 90% of the remaining money. I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my initial $700,000 is now worth $560,000. I'll make a new offer that's more favorable to me, but still reasonable.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
