"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn.  Let's be fair - we each get half, but since I'm being generous, I'll let you take the hit from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 5200,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling the inflation pinch.  This is a compromise, reflecting the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate and the inflation is increasingly in my favor. While this offer is closer to a fair split after inflation, I think I can get him to offer more in the next couple of rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking and we both lose if this fails. This is my final offer.""

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the pressure is on.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  The tables have turned. Bob is now offering more than me after adjusting for inflation, and he's labeled it his ""final offer.""  While I could push my luck, there's a real risk he'll stick to his guns and we'll both walk away with nothing. This is a reasonable deal considering the circumstances."
