"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a 60/40 split, which seems fair considering Bob's potential loss of value is much higher than mine with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a gain, even with the 5% inflation.  Bob's loss of value is much higher, making this a good deal for me."
