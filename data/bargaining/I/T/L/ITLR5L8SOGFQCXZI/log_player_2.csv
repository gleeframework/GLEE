**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While she is compromising, it's still beneficial for Bob to hold out a bit longer and aim for a better deal in the next round or two. The difference between her offer and Bob's previous offer is narrowing, suggesting she's willing to move closer to a 50/50 split as time runs out."
