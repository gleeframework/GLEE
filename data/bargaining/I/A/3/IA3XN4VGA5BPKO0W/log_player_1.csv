Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a more even split, recognizing that the value of money will continue to decline.  This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
