"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly suggestion to start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2,500 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $2,250.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90% = 81%). I'll take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's split it 45/55!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, 55% of the current value, in an attempt to reach a compromise."
