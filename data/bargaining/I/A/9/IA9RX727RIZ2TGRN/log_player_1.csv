"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a bigger share. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the money. I'll wait for his next offer."
