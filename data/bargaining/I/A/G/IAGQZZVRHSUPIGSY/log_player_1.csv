"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll get 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000. And Bob will get 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather not settle for less than I initially proposed, especially considering the inflation will continue to erode the value of the money. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

This way, I'll get a larger share, but not so large that Bob will reject it."
