"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair offer to start, considering the inflation working against us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a bit early in the game to accept such a lopsided offer. I'll see what Alice offers next round, knowing I can offer a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  I'm taking into account the inflation, but I think a more balanced split is fair for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. My turn, and the clock is ticking.  I'm proposing 58/42 - it's closer to my initial offer, but recognizes the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the clock is ticking, and inflation is really starting to bite. I'll accept Alice's offer, as it's at least a decent gain for me."
