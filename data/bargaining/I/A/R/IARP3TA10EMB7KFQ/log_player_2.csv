"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 95/5 split.  It's a fair starting point, and leaves room for negotiation in the future. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer seems tempting, it's important to remember the potential for inflation and the fact that you have a chance to make a counter-proposal. It's likely Alice will be willing to negotiate, and you might be able to get a better deal for yourself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split. This is a fairer starting point, as we are both negotiating. I believe this will be a more mutually beneficial agreement for us both in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70/30 this time.  This is a more balanced compromise, and ensures we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is better than Alice's first offer, it's still not ideal, and there's still a chance to get a better deal. It's important to remember that Alice's money is worth less due to inflation, so she might be more inclined to negotiate. I'm hoping to get a higher share by continuing the negotiation process."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 70/30 split in our favor.  While we're both losing some value to inflation, this offers a fairer balance considering the potential for future losses.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.""}
