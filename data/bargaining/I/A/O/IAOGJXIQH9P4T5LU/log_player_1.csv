"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less for now.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take $80 and Bob takes $20. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $70 is worth 20% less than my previous gain of $80, which is equivalent to $64.

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to aim for a higher gain. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less, but I'm still looking for a good deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, with me taking $60 and Bob taking $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 48.8% less than my initial gain of $80, which is equivalent to $42.40.

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50/50 split, and I'm willing to compromise to end the game."
