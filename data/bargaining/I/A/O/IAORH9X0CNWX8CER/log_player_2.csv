Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Take it or leave it 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for Bob with each round. Waiting longer means getting even less in real terms.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and is unlikely to offer anything better. She's in a strong position.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  $400,000 is a significant amount of money, even with the inflation loss. Rejecting this offer risks walking away with nothing if Alice continues to lowball in future rounds."
