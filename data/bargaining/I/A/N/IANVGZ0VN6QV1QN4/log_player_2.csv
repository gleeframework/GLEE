Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going down to 40%.  Let's split it 70/30. This is a fair starting point for the remaining rounds. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, accepting 30% now sets a bad precedent for future rounds.  Even with inflation, holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds is the stronger move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. 55/45 is my final offer."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. It's crucial to apply pressure and signal a sense of urgency to Alice.
* **Strong Stance:** By presenting this as a ""final offer,"" Bob aims to convey his seriousness and unwillingness to accept anything significantly lower.
* **Middle Ground:** While the 55/45 split is still favorable to Bob, it offers Alice a reasonable enough share that she might accept rather than risk further inflation."
