"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll give you a fair deal""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's money being worth 10% less, this offer is actually a better deal for me than the original 60-40 split.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
