"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a straightforward offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to get a bigger share now. However, I don't want to give up too much to Bob. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In the third round, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round for me, and 20% less for Bob. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a higher share as the rounds go on. I'll think carefully about this offer. However, considering the inflation rate, I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
