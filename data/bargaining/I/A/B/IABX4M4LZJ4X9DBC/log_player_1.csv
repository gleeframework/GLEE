Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose we split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share.  I think this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the risk of being the first to offer. What do you think?""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. I propose a 52.5/47.5 split. It's more equitable and accounts for the risk we both take by continuing. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
