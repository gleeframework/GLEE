"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I think this is a fair starting point, given that I'm the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. Although I'm losing money due to inflation, this offer is too far in Bob's favor. I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a fair share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still too unfavorable. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating, hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I propose a 45/55 split in my favor. While inflation is a factor, I believe this is a fair compromise that gives both of us a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the money I'm receiving is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, I have to accept this offer. With each round, inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money, and I'm risking getting nothing at all if I keep rejecting offers. It's a difficult decision, but accepting the offer is the most logical choice at this point."
