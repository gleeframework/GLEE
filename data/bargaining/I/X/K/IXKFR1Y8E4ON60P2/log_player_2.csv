"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60%, you get 40%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation for both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice, I'll adjust the split accordingly.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 45% for me and 55% for you is a fairer split. Your turn!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects us differently, but I'm willing to stick with my initial offer.  It's still the fairest split in my view. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer again since it doesn't take into account the increasing impact of inflation on my gain. The offer remains the same as the first round, but the value of the money has decreased significantly for me. I'll wait for another chance to make a counteroffer that considers the current value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the increasing impact of inflation, I'll adjust my offer again. The money is now worth 36% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the first round. I'll try to find a balance that reflects this change in value.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I'm adjusting the split to 48% for me and 52% for you. I believe this is more reflective of the current situation.""}"
