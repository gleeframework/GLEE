"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to take a small amount to avoid getting nothing at all if we reach the end of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I'd rather take half than risk getting nothing."
