"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is willing to accept a fair and equal division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round, my gain of 40 in this round is actually 40 * 0.95 = 38.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not give Bob 60, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight edge""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up my edge yet 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this round, considering the 14.26% decrease in value from the first round. 

Original value of $100: $100
Value after 5% decrease in round 1: $100 * 0.95 = $95
Value after 9.26% decrease in round 2: $95 * 0.905 = $85.975
Value after 5% decrease in round 3: $85.975 * 0.95 = $81.859375
Value after 9.26% decrease in round 4: $81.859375 * 0.859 = $70.34209375

So, my gain of 42 in this round is actually worth $42 * 0.7034209375 = $29.499.

I'm not happy with this offer, and I think I can do better. I'll reject it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."
