"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 4:1 split in my favor. While inflation is a risk, I believe this division is fairer considering the potential for future negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
