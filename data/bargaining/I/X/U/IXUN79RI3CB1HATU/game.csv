500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm offering a perfectly even split.  Every round that passes hurts me more than you.  Let's end this now with a fair deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
570000.0,430000.0,"You're right, every round hurts you more, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",Alice,5,

490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a very favorable split considering the circumstances. Accept this now, or I'm going to start being much more aggressive to make up for the lost value.",Bob,6,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer.  The inflation means this is already a sacrifice for me. If you're serious about reaching a deal, you'll accept this. Otherwise, we'll both walk away with nothing.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll take what you can get at this point. This is my offer, take it or leave it.",Alice,9,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, this is it.  We're down to the wire.  Accept this offer - it's more than fair considering the circumstances - or we both get nothing. Don't be greedy.",Bob,10,
