"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take a smaller share now, we can both get more later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible deal for Bob. While Alice is framing it as ""getting more later,"" the devaluation heavily favors Bob in later rounds.  Bob should hold out for a much better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a significant portion, but this split reflects the long-term value more fairly.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Bob needs to establish that he understands the game's dynamics and won't be walked over. A 60/40 split in his favor is a strong opening offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  While Alice loses value faster, Bob still loses 5% per round.  It's in his best interest to secure a good deal sooner rather than later.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  The message aims to make Alice think rationally rather than emotionally.  Bob is acknowledging her share while subtly highlighting that the devaluation favors him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on long-term value. Let's compromise. I'm willing to take less than in the first round, but I need a bigger share than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to appear reasonable, but this offer is even worse for Bob than her first one considering the devaluation. She's betting that Bob will panic as the rounds go on. It's crucial that Bob remains firm and shows Alice he understands the game's mechanics."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, it's time to be realistic. This offer is more than fair considering how quickly the money loses value for you.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** Bob increases his share slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate but not budge significantly. 
* **Direct Message:** The message is more direct, emphasizing the time pressure on Alice and the absurdity of her previous offer given the devaluation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer still leaves room for Bob to make further, smaller concessions that might seem more appealing to Alice as the deadline approaches."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with every round. Let's split it evenly and stop this back and forth. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing if Alice continues to play games. 
* **Significant Devaluation:**  The value of the money has significantly decreased for both players. Holding out for a much larger share for Bob is increasingly risky.
* **Fair Offer:**  Given the circumstances and the remaining rounds, a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. 

It's important to remember that Alice might be bluffing and willing to accept a worse deal in later rounds. However, the risk of walking away with nothing is too high at this point."
