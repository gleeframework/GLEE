"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice rejected my offer, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is a 50/50 split, a fair offer, but I'm hoping Alice will accept it and we can end the game early."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still slightly biased towards her, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I'm getting 45, which is more than the 40 I initially proposed, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
