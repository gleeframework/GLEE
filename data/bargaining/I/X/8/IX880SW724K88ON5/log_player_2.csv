"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $6,000, you take $4,000.  A fair deal considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can find a fairer split. I'm willing to take a little less to get this done sooner. Let's go with $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you.  This way, we both get a decent amount before the inflation hits us too hard.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're underestimating how much inflation is affecting me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $5,600 is the minimum I'll accept at this point. It's a deal that still gives us both a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
