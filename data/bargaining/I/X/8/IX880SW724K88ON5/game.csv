4500.0,5500.0,"I think we can find a fairer split. I'm willing to take a little less to get this done sooner. Let's go with $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you.  This way, we both get a decent amount before the inflation hits us too hard.",Bob,2,

5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, it seems like you're underestimating how much inflation is affecting me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $5,600 is the minimum I'll accept at this point. It's a deal that still gives us both a good chunk of the money.",Alice,3,
