"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a fairer split. I'm willing to take a little less to get this done sooner. Let's go with $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you.  This way, we both get a decent amount before the inflation hits us too hard. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
