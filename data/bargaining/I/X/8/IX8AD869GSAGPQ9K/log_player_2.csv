Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one, and a classic illustration of game theory at play. Here's why I'm finally accepting:

* **Declining Value:** With each round, my potential earnings are drastically reduced. Taking 300,000 now is significantly better than risking another round for even less. 
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, knowing inflation hurts me more than her. Her offers have been getting progressively worse for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better deal in the future is too risky at this point.  

While 300,000 is much lower than I'd like, it's the most logical choice given the circumstances."
