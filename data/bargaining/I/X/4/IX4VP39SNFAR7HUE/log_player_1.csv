"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 20% of the now-devalued money is a good deal for me. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is biting, but I'll try to make a better offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but still keep some room for negotiation."
