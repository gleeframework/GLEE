"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a bigger share.
