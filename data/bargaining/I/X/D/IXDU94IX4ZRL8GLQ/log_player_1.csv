"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, you can't do better than that!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. Let's see if he accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly. It's fair and ensures both of us get an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think splitting it evenly is the best deal for me, especially considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer needs to be more aggressive to make up for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
