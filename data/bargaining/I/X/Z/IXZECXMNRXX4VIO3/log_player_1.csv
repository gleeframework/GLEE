"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob 30% of the money, which is a relatively small amount, so I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
