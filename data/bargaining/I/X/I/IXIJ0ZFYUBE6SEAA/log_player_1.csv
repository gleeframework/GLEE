"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose to take almost all of the money, leaving just $1 for Bob. Since inflation affects Bob more, I believe this is a good strategy to ensure I get the largest share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred to get more, it's likely Bob will continue to offer an even split in future rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I receive at least half the money, which is better than potentially losing more due to inflation."
