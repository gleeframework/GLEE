"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a clean slate. Accept and we can end the game now.""
}
```

This offer is a straightforward 0-100 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation that will come with more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40. Fair deal, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd like to get a larger share now. However, Bob's offer is a decent one, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
