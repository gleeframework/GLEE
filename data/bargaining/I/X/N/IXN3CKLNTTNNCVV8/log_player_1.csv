"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly 80/20, is that fair?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of $4,000 is actually equivalent to $3,800 in the previous round's value.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'm willing to compromise. I think $6,000 is a bit too high for Bob's share, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
