I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This gives me the most money but leaves Bob with something.  Let's see if he's willing to take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  Bob is being too greedy! I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 

I'm offering a more even split this time.  I'm willing to give up some of my potential gains to show Bob I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal done!"
