"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from Round 1 is now worth 10% less, so I'll consider Bob's offer in terms of the original amounts.

Since I would have gotten 600,000 in Round 1, I would have gotten 600,000 * 0.9 = 540,000 in the current round. Bob's offer would give me 450,000, which is less than that.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 2, I would have gotten 540,000 in my previous offer, and Bob would have gotten 600,000. Now, due to inflation, my offer will be worth 10% less, and Bob's offer will be worth 5% less.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```"
