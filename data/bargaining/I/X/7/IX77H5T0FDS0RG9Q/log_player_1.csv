Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8000 gain is now worth $6400 in the new round.

I don't like Bob's offer. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject his offer.
