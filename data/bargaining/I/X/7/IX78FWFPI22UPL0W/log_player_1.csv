Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. This is a strategy to try and get him to accept quickly, avoiding any potential inflation.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a fair split in terms of money, I'm hoping to capitalize on the inflation effect. Since Bob's gain is now worth less due to inflation, he might be more willing to accept a less favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly less generous split than before.  Since Bob is likely feeling the effects of inflation, he might be more willing to accept a smaller share to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Inflation has clearly taken its toll on Bob's gains, and he's now offering a significantly lower share to me. While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to secure a profit than risk further losses."
