"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so the actual amount I'll gain is $400,000, which is 40% of the total. I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll play it safe and accept Bob's offer.
