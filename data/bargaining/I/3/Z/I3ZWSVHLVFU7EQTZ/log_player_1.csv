"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 400,000 and Bob will take 600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm a bit disappointed that Bob is trying to take a bigger share.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground between my initial 60-40 and Bob's 70-30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, Bob's offer is quite aggressive!

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm worried about the huge gap in the proposed split. 80% for Bob is too much!

I'll decide to reject this offer and make another proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find a more balanced solution. With each round, the money is worth less for Bob, so I'm trying to make the split more equal to account for that."
