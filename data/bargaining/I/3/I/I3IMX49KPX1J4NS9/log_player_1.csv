"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, Alice. I figure it's a fair starting point, and I'm willing to compromise in later rounds if needed. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a drastic change from the first round. While my share is worth less due to inflation, his is only slightly affected. I'm not comfortable with such a significant shift in the distribution, and I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to propose a 70/30 split in my favor. While Bob's offer was significantly lower than my initial proposal, I'm willing to compromise a bit more to reach a deal. Let's see if he's more agreeable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer continues to be unfavorable. While my share is significantly impacted by inflation, his is only slightly affected. This offer is unacceptable given that it moves the split further in his favor. I'm not giving up, and I'm confident I can reach a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair to Bob and ensuring I get a reasonable share of the money, especially given the significant inflation affecting my potential gain. Let's see if this offer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse.  While my share is significantly eroded by inflation, his is only modestly affected. This offer is unacceptable, and I'm determined to reach a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  With the inflation hitting me hard, I need to find a way to secure a decent share of the money.  A 50/50 split seems the fairest way to divide the money given the current circumstances.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this as a fair offer."
