Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want the lion's share. Take it or leave it.

# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early in the game to accept such a lopsided deal.  Let's see if we can negotiate something fairer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust from there if needed.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get the majority share.  This is my final offer before I risk losing even more due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too lopsided. While I'm willing to compromise, I won't settle for a deal where I get such a small share.  Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get at least 400,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.""}
