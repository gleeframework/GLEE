"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, we can adjust in future rounds""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split to begin with, leaving room for potential adjustments in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess in future rounds 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $47.50.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
