"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept it, as he gets something, even if it's very little.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much more fair than the previous one, and given the inflation, it's a good deal for me. I'll take it."
