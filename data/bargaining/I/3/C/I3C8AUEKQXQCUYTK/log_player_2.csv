Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is becoming the less risky option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer means accepting a smaller and smaller piece of a shrinking pie.
* **Time Pressure:** Only 7 rounds remain.  If we continue to reject offers, we risk running out of time and getting nothing.
* **Better Than Later Offers:** Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal as the game goes on. Her offers will likely get worse as she realizes the time pressure. 

It's a tough decision, but taking the guaranteed amount now is preferable to gambling on a potentially worse outcome later."
