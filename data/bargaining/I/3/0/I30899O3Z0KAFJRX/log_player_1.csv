}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I need to be strategic.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less for me, I need to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a serious offer, don't expect a better deal from me!""
