"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a fair split now, the inflation will hurt me more than Alice in future rounds. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to reverse the roles this round, but I'm open to negotiation if you have a better idea.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping you'll accept. 
# Bob gain: 510000 
# Alice gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I would have preferred a 60/40 split, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  Alice's offer is close enough, and the inflation is becoming a major factor."
