"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly. 10% inflation is brutal.  Take this generous offer and we can both move on.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. We each take half, and we can both go home with a decent amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand fairness is important, but time is literally money for me. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This offer gives you a significant share, and we can finally end this game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  Accept this offer, or I'm walking away and you get nothing! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not ideal, taking 300,000 is better than getting nothing.  Alice's threats and the continued inflation mean that it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
