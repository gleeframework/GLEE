"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's split it 60-40, but in my favor this time! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get 40 * 0.95 = 38.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to account for the decreasing value. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, but don't get too comfortable!""
}"
