I'm going for a slightly aggressive offer.  I figure I can keep most of the money, but I'll offer Bob a small amount to give him some incentive to accept. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept that! Bob is being way too greedy.  I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This time, I'm going for a more balanced approach. I'll offer Bob a significant share, but I'll still keep the majority.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
