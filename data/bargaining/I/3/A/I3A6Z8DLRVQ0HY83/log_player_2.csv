"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I believe I can negotiate for a more favorable split. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than 60/40. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?""}\n\n###\nI've made a counteroffer that gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will find this proposal more acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly this time.  We both lose out if we keep rejecting offers. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer of an even split. Given the effects of inflation, it's likely that further negotiations will only lead to diminishing returns. By accepting this offer, I'm securing a reasonable share of the money, and we can both walk away with something rather than risking getting nothing if the game continues too long."
