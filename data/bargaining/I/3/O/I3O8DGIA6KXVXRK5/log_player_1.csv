"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 400,000 is actually equivalent to 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000 in the original amount.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split in my favor, but still keeping it relatively close. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise on the rest. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 300,000 is actually equivalent to 300,000 / 0.721 = 415,514.83 in the original amount.

I'm not happy about the 70/30 split, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 350000,
  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob, but I need a better deal this time!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not being too aggressive. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, Alice. This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, my gain of 200,000 is actually equivalent to 200,000 / 0.5915 = 338,434.21 in the original amount.

I'm not happy about the 20/80 split, but I'm starting to get concerned that if I reject this offer, I might end up with even less. I'll decide to accept this offer.
