"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm not being too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I would get is 20 * 0.8 = 16.

I don't think this offer is very generous, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 20% of 16, which is 3.2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob."
