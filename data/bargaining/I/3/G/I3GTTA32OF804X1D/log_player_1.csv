Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively small amount for me to give up, but it's a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
