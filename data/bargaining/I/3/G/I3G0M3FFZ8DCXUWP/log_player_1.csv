"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'm more affected by inflation in this game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's meet closer to the middle, considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer:

* **Bob's gain:** $5500 (slightly less than last round due to inflation)
* **My gain:** $4500 (significantly less than my initial offer due to inflation)

While Bob's message acknowledges the inflation impact, his offer doesn't fairly reflect it.  It heavily favors him, especially as more rounds pass. I need to incentivize him to settle quickly. 

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This offer is more in line with a fair split considering the inflation. I'm motivated to settle quickly, so let's avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and the pot is shrinking fast.  My last offer was fair.  Let's settle this - I'm taking a small hit here to get it done. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tricky situation. Let's break it down:

* **Time pressure:** We are at round 4 out of 12, and the value is decreasing rapidly.
* **Bob's offer:** While his offer is still slightly in his favor, he is correct that he is taking a small hit from his round 2 offer.
* **Future rounds:** If I reject, there's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob, and the value will keep decreasing.

Considering the time pressure and the decreasing value, it's strategically better to accept a less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting even less later.
