"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split, implying that I'm willing to be generous at the beginning of the game."
