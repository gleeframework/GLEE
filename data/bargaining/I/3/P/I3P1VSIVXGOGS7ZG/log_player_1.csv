"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself, which seems like a fair split to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my perception of the offer accordingly.

In this round, $20 for me is equivalent to $25 in the first round, and $80 for Bob is equivalent to $84 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $65 and keeping $35 for myself, hoping it's a more acceptable split."
