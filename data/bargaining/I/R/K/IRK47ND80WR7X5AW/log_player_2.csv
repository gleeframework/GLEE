``` 

This is a great starting point for a game! I'm going to try to strategize and see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Since the money is worth less to me with each round, I'll need to be careful about when I accept an offer.  I'll let you know my proposal in the next round!"

# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting worse for me each round, and I'm still losing value on my potential gains.  I'm going to keep rejecting and see if I can get a better deal.  I'll need to be careful though, I'm running out of time!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting increasingly worse for me, and while the message is true about the money losing value, I still have some leverage. I'll keep rejecting for now and see if I can get a better deal later. I'm starting to get nervous about running out of time though!"

# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting worse with each round.  While I am losing value, I'm still not desperate enough to accept this. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better deal, but I'm running out of time. I might need to reconsider my strategy in the next round."

{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's message is accurate, I'm still not willing to accept such a small share.  I'm running out of time, but I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal. I might need to start considering accepting even a worse offer, but I'm not there yet."
