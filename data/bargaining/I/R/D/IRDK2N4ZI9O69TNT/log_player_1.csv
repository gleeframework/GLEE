"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to settle for a smaller share. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent deal."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more generous offer now. I'll consider it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with further inflation."
