"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* My gain: $500,000, which is worth 80% of $700,000 (my gain in Round 1)
* Bob's gain: $500,000, which is 95% of $300,000 (his gain in Round 1)

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a good one, as it's a 50-50 split. I'll accept this offer.
