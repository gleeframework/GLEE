I'm proposing to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  It's a pretty fair deal, considering the money will be worth less to me in the next round! Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd rather have more money, it's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all.  This offer is much better than the next round, where I'll lose another 20% on the value of the money I receive."
