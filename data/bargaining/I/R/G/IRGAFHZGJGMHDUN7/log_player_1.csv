"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. You can try to negotiate better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 9:1 split in my favor, with me getting $9,000 and Bob getting $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can consider this a compromise. We can try to find a better solution in the next round if needed. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll accept your offer. 6,000 for me and 4,000 for you seems like a decent compromise. I'm glad we could find a middle ground.""
}
```"
