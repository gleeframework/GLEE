"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Bob. So, Bob's offer is effectively:

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 720000 

I accept this offer.
