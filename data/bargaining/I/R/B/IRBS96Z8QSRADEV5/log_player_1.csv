"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

This is a classic game theory scenario!  I'm going to start by offering Bob a very small amount.  It's unlikely he'll accept in the first round, but it sets the stage for future negotiations.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to have more, Bob's offer is fair.  It's a 50/50 split, which is a good outcome in this situation.  Accepting avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
