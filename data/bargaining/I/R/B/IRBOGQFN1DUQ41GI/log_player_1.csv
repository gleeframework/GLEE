"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I propose to keep almost everything for myself, giving Bob just $1.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  If he accepts, I win big.  If he rejects, I know I'll be making the offer in the next round, and inflation will work in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep more, the 10% inflation makes accepting Bob's offer the best choice.  Getting 500,000 is better than risking a lower share in the next round."
