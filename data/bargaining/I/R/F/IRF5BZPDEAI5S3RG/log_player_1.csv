Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's work together to get a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We both have a lot to lose if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting a worse offer from Bob later or, even worse, walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
