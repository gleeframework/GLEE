"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, and my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
