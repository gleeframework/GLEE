"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, let's try to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can do better than that, and I'm not yet willing to accept a 3:2 split. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 6:4""
}
```

I'm proposing a 6:4 split, trying to meet Bob in the middle and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's try 50:50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! My gain is worth significantly less now. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of a 50:50 split. It's not the best I could have hoped for, but considering the inflation and the fact that I've already rejected two previous offers, I think this is a fair compromise."
