Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the same.  I understand inflation is a factor, but consider that I'm losing more with each round. Accepting now is the best way to maximize both our gains.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise slightly, but a 50/50 split isn't fair considering the inflation working against me. This offer still gives you a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is starting to make concessions. While her offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, I believe I can push for a slightly better deal in the next few rounds."
