Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the potential for inflation, I propose a division where I receive $55 and you receive $45. This maintains a reasonable gap to account for future value loss. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
