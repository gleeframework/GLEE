"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only 10% of the total amount, especially considering that the money is worth less with each passing round due to inflation. I'll take my chances and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation.""}\n\nSince Alice's initial offer was too low for me, I'll try to propose a more balanced division, taking into account the inflation factor that affects me but not Alice. I'm aiming for a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us, ensuring we both get a significant share before the value of the money decreases further."
