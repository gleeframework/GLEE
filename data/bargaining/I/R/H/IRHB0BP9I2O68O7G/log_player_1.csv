Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to secure a large portion of the money right away. Let's see if Bob is happy with a small slice!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round. Bob's offer is fair, and I don't want to push my luck with inflation."
