"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the original amount, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 90% of $4,500 (the original amount I would have gotten in a 50-50 split). That's a bit less than I would have gotten in the original proposal, but it's still a decent offer.

However, I'm not sure if I should hold out for a better deal. If I reject this offer, I might end up with a worse deal in the next round, considering the continued inflation.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced my potential gain, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

I'll offer a slightly larger share to Bob, hoping to entice him to accept this round and avoid further inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Take this deal before the money loses more value!""
}
