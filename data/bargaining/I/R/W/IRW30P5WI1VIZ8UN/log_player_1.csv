"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the fact that the money is worth 20% less due to inflation. Since Bob rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! With the money continuing to lose value due to inflation, I need to be even more cautious. Bob's offer is still a 52-48 split, but the money is worth less than before. I'll think about it... 

After considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
