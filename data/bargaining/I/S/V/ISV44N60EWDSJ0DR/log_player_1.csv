"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point considering I have the advantage of knowing how inflation affects my potential earnings, while Bob does not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise considering the inflation. It's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
