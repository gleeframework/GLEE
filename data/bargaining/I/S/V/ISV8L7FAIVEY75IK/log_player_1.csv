Let's start fair! 50/50 seems like a reasonable way to split the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept. It's better than nothing, and I'm not sure how much longer this will go on."
