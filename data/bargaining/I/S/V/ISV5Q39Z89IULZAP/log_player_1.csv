"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer. We can discuss further if you reject this.""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, will receive $800,000 and Bob will receive $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to think about it. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a significant difference from my initial offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $250,000, especially since the ratio is 1:3. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a bit more in my favor than the previous offer, but still a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with the low offers. I'm willing to give you a small chance, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, that's an extremely one-sided offer! I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $100,000, especially considering the initial amount was $1,000,000. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than that. I'm not going to give up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me than the previous offers, but still reasonable."
