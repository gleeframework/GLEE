Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a slightly different split, Alice.  Let's go with a 55/45 division in my favor. I think this will be a good start, and we can hopefully work towards a mutually beneficial agreement in the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
