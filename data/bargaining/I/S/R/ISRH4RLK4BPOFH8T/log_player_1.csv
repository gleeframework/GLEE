"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000 and take $8,000. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the stakes. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I need to be careful not to give away too much.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 75-25 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive than before. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise again. This time, I'll give you a slightly larger share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the money is now worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I need to be cautious not to give away too much. However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to the original amount, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
