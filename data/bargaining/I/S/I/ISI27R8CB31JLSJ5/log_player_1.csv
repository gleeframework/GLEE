"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60% for myself.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a decent share of the money, and I'm keeping a significant portion for myself. Let's see what he has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer since it's not in my favor, and I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more. Take this and we can wrap it up.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous this time, but still keeping a slight edge. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
