"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 55/45 split seems reasonable for us to both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my last offer is getting worse with inflation. This is a compromise to make up for the time pressure, but we need to move quickly. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is emphasizing the impact of inflation on her gains, the offer is still tilted in her favor. By rejecting this offer, I'm betting that Alice will become more amenable to a larger split in my favor as the rounds progress and the inflation continues to eat into the value of her potential winnings."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the value is literally disappearing. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances.  Take it or leave it.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Let's end this before we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point. Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees me a substantial sum, whereas continuing to gamble risks getting nothing at all if we fail to reach an agreement."
