"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk to get the negotiations going. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is decent, it's better to see if Alice is willing to give more.  By rejecting, I have the opportunity to propose a division more favorable to me in the next round.  It's also possible Alice will offer more in the next round to avoid me getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  I'm sure we can both agree this is a fair starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to make up for the inflation. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than the first one, I'm still hoping for a better split, especially considering the inflation.  I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a higher percentage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is making things tough, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. This is my final offer before I accept whatever you propose next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting desperate. This is my last chance to get a decent share before the money is almost worthless. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, and Alice's offer, while not ideal, is still better than what I'll be able to get if I reject and go to the next round.  I'll accept to secure at least something."
