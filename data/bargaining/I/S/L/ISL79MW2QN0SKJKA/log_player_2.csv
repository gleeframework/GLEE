"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer seems fair at first glance, it actually significantly favors Alice due to the inflation rates.  I need to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should still be higher. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of my impatience! While she acknowledges the inflation, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold firm and aim for a more equitable split."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
