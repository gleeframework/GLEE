"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, as we both get to keep a decent share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to reverse the split from my original offer.

I'll consider his proposal, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up more than I initially offered. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better share. What do you think?""
}
```"
