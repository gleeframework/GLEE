"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a moderate offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
