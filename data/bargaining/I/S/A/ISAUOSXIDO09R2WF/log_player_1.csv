"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take 60 dollars and offer Bob 40 dollars. The message is a brief explanation of the proposal, trying to persuade Bob to accept it. Since this is the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I'm playing as Alice, I'll consider the offer. Given that the money I gain is now worth 10% less, the effective value for me would be 50 * 0.9 = 45 dollars. Considering this, I'll make my decision.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject the offer because, considering the inflation, I would effectively get less than Bob, even though the nominal amount is the same. It's still early in the game, so I'll try to negotiate for a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split""}\n\nI'll offer a slight adjustment from the previous round, taking into account the inflation that affects my gain. By offering Bob 42 dollars and taking 58 dollars for myself, I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable, given that the money is still worth the same to him. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to offer a little more to ensure we reach an agreement, but I still think an even split is the best way to go. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWith the inflation in effect, the 45 dollars offered to me is actually worth 45 * 0.729 = 32.805 dollars in terms of the original value. Given that we're still in the early rounds and I've already made a compromise in my previous offer, I believe there's room for further negotiation to achieve a more favorable split. I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to find a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a compromise by offering a split that is closer to the middle, while still taking into account the effects of inflation on my gain. By offering Bob 45 dollars and taking 55 dollars for myself, I'm hoping to find a mutually acceptable solution. The message emphasizes the effort to meet in the middle, considering the inflation factor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
