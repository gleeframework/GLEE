"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it... I don't want to give Bob too much, but I also don't want to risk going into more rounds. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
