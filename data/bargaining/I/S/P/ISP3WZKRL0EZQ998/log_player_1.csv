"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous this round, but I'm sure you'll be more agreeable next time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split this time, trying to find a middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob."
