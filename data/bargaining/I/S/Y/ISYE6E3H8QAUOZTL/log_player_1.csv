"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a relatively fair offer, but I'm giving myself a slightly larger share, anticipating the inflation that will favor Bob in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a less favorable deal than the one I proposed, it's still a decent split, and the inflation will only worsen for me in the future. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something."
