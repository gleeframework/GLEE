"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  The value of the money decreases for me with each round, so I need to push for a better deal quickly.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to signal to Alice that I'm serious and she risks getting a worse deal if she rejects.
* **Slight advantage:** My offer is still slightly in my favor, but it's closer to even, making it more tempting for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to what I want 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The money is losing value quickly for me, but Alice is getting greedier. It's better to hold out and see if she'll offer a more reasonable deal in Round 4. If I accept now, I'm getting a much worse deal than her original offer in Round 1.  I need to push back and hope she compromises."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out! Let's be fair and split it evenly.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  The money is depreciating rapidly for me, and I need to reach an agreement soon.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm appealing to Alice's sense of fairness, which might make her more likely to accept. 
* **Preventing Loss:**  If we don't reach an agreement soon, the money will lose so much value that even a slightly favorable split won't be worth much.  A 50/50 split now is better than risking a worse outcome later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the clock is working against me. Here's why I have to accept:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 34.39% decrease in value is really hurting. Every round that passes makes the potential gains significantly smaller for me.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows she's in a strong position and is unlikely to budge much from her offer.  She's been consistently aiming for a larger share.
* **Something is better than nothing:** While 3800 is much less than I wanted at the start, it's better than risking another round where I might get even less, or even walk away with nothing.

It's frustrating, but accepting is the most logical choice in this situation."
