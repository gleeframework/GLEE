"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. I'll think carefully...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to get a bit closer to 50-50.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
