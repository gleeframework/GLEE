"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving me 70% of the initial amount, while still leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, I'll consider the effective gains in terms of the original amount.

In the second round, I would be getting $500,000, but its value is equivalent to $400,000 in the first round's money. This is less than my initial offer of $700,000 in the first round, which is equivalent to $560,000 in the second round's money.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 20% inflation effect, the money is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8^2). My goal is to maximize my gain while still making it attractive for Bob to accept.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000
}
```"
