Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a greedy approach here.  Since I lose 10% each round, I want to secure as much as possible right away. Even a tiny amount for Bob might be enough to get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a lot better than my previous one, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I'll risk another round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still trying to maximize my share. This time, I'm giving Bob a more significant portion, hoping to entice him to accept.  I'm also aware that inflation will continue to erode the value of my share if we go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation has significantly eroded the value of my potential gains, and I don't want to risk another round. While I'm getting a much smaller share than I initially hoped for, it's better than nothing at this point."
