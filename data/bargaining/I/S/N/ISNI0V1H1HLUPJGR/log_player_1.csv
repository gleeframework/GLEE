"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at this point in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 50-50 split I initially proposed is no longer as attractive. Bob's offer is quite lopsided, but it's still worth considering.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses more value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, Bob's offer is starting to look more attractive. I'll consider accepting this offer, but I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After weighing the options, I'll...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. My proposal will need to take this into account. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give me a slightly larger share, but still trying to be reasonable given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. With the current offer, Bob is getting a significantly larger share, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

However, I need to consider the fact that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits.

After thinking about it, I'll...

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point."
