Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think we should get a bit more since we're taking the risk of further rounds.  This is a strong starting offer.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the risk we're taking with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's not a great offer, but with inflation eating away at the money, it's better to take a decent amount now than risk getting even less later."
