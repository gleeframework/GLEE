"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! Thanks for the reminder.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if 3000 is enough for me. On the other hand, I don't want to give Bob an opportunity to make another offer that might be even worse.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to keep up with inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me now! My gain of 4500 is worth even less than before.

Considering the offers I've seen so far, this one seems like a decent compromise. I'm not sure if I can do better, and the message from Bob suggests he's not willing to give up much more. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
