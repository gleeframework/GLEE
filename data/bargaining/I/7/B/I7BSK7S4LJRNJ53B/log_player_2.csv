"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice compared to the original amount, the effective amount is:

$1,000,000 * 0.8 (20% decrease for me) = $800,000 for me
$1,000,000 * 0.95 (5% decrease for Alice) = $950,000 for Alice

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective amount for each of us considering the inflation:

My gain: $700,000 is worth 36% less than the original $600,000, so it's $600,000 * 0.64 = $384,000
Alice's gain: $300,000 is worth 9.75% less than the original $400,000, so it's $400,000 * 0.905 = $362,000

My offer seems reasonable, but I'll try to do better. I'll reject this offer.
