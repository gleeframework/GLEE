"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, this offer is actually more generous than it seems.

I'll accept this offer.
