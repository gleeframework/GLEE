Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty lopsided split, taking 90% of the money for myself.  I figure Bob might be tempted to accept, as getting 100,000$ is better than nothing. However, I'm prepared for him to reject and make a counter-offer in the next round. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, I realize that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least 200,000$, which is better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
