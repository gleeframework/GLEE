"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,500 and keep $5,500 for myself. This seems like a reasonable and fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm hoping for a more balanced split.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I offered Bob a 45/55 split in my favor in Round 1 and he rejected it, it's interesting that he's offering the same split but in his favor this time. Given that I don't lose value due to inflation, I can afford to wait and try to negotiate a better deal. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try and get a more favorable split.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nGiven that Bob offered a 45/55 split in his favor in Round 2 and I rejected it, I'll try to find a middle ground while still aiming for a favorable split. Considering Bob loses value due to inflation, he might be more inclined to accept a slightly less favorable offer to avoid further devaluation. I'll offer Bob $5200 and keep $4800 for myself, trying to appear more generous while still benefiting from the split.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
