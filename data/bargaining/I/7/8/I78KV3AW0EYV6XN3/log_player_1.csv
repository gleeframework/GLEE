"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 90% for me and 10% for you. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Splitting 60-40, a fair deal, no? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has reduced the value of the money, so the numbers are:

* My gain: 4,000
* Bob's gain: 6,000

Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer is actually a good one. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
