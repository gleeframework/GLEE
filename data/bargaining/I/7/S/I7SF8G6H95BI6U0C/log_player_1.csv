"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 600,000 and Bob receives 400,000. I think this is a good starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the new proposal. I was hoping for a more even split, and this offer is quite lopsided in Bob's favor. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and hope to make a better proposal in the next round."
