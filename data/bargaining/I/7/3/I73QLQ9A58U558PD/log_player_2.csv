Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This time I'm being more reasonable, Bob.  Let's end this before the money gets even less valuable. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 902500,
""alice_gain"": 97500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer and let's move on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting tiresome. Let's agree on this before things get worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, Bob's potential gains decrease substantially due to inflation.  Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice knows time is on her side. Her offers are unlikely to get significantly better for Bob.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable sum, albeit much smaller than initially hoped. Rejecting risks getting an even worse deal or even nothing in a later round."
