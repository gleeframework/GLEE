"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, let's start with a fair split, but I think I can do a bit better than that! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $700,000 gain from the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $665,000. And Bob's offer of $500,000 is the same as it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my potential gain is worth 5% less than in the second round, which is 95% of $665,000, or $631,750.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you deserve more, but I'm not giving up yet! I'll meet you in the middle, but that's as high as I'll go! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain from the first round is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $857,400. And Bob's offer is still worth the same as in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. A 45-55 split is better than I initially proposed, and I don't want to risk going to another round with more inflation."
