Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

``` 

Taking Bob's offer is the best option at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less money is worth to me due to inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means risking an even lower offer in the next round, where the value will decrease further.  
* **Present Value:** While not ideal, $4,200 is still better than risking an even lower amount or potentially getting nothing if I continue to reject offers."
