"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount, and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can try to counteroffer if you want. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual values:

Alice gain: $200,000 (pre-inflation) × 0.9 = $180,000
Bob gain: $800,000 (pre-inflation) × 0.9 = $720,000

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll try to do better. You can keep your offer as a starting point.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm leaving it as a reference point for my next counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up yet.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm keeping $550,000 and offering Bob $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual values:

Alice gain: $400,000 (pre-inflation) × 0.727 = $291,080
Bob gain: $600,000 (pre-inflation) × 0.727 = $436,220

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I think we can do better. I'm glad we're narrowing down the gap.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can conclude the game."
