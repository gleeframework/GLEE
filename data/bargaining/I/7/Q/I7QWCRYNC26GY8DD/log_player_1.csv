"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point, giving Bob a decent amount while still leaving me with the majority. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, the inflation will severely hurt me in the long run. I'll take my chances with making a proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly more even split, with me taking 810,000 and Bob getting 190,000.  With the inflation, I'm still getting a decent amount, and this should hopefully be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Although the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, I'm not confident I can get a better deal by rejecting. Accepting ensures I get something, and at this point, I'd rather have something than risk getting nothing at all."
