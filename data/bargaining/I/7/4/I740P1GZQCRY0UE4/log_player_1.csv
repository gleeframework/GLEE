}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain of 60 is worth 20% less than the 80 I proposed in the first round, which is a significant reduction.
