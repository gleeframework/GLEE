"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Consider it a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed gain by 200, trying to find a sweet spot where Bob might be willing to accept."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain is now significantly reduced.

  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. I need a fair share.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit on my potential gain now! With the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, my gain is significantly reduced.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 3000, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from him. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I'm making the best of a bad situation.
