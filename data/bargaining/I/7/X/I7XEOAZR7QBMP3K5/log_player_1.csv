"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This seems fair considering the slight difference in the rate of decrease in value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. We both lose value over time, so a fair split seems like the best option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
