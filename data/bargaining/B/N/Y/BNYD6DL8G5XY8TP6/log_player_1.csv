Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to ensure we both benefit. Let's be logical. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, the time pressure is significant. Accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice to ensure I receive a substantial sum, even with the impact of inflation.  Refusing the offer risks a worse outcome as time runs out."
