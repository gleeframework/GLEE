"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the offer was not accepted, the money is still worth 100% of its original value. Here's my proposal for Round 2:

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, the actual amounts I would receive are:

* Alice's offer: 25 * 0.9 (90% of original) = 22.5
* Alice's offer: 75 * 0.905 (90.5% of original) = 68.0375

I'll accept Alice's offer this time.
