I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for most of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is way too lopsided in his favor. I'll take my chances with the inflation and make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I've lowered my ask a bit to make it more appealing to Bob. With the inflation, both of us are losing value, so hopefully this compromise will be enough to get us a deal."
