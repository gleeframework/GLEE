"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 580,000 is actually worth 522,000 in real value, and Bob's gain of 420,000 is worth 420,000.

I think this offer is a bit more favorable to Bob, so I'll reject it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 680,000 is actually worth 482,980 in real value, and Bob's gain of 320,000 is still worth 320,000.

I think this offer is a bit more reasonable, considering the inflation. I'll accept it.
