"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to take a chance and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less with each passing round, I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise to avoid losing more value.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly in my favor, considering the 10% decrease in value from the previous round.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we should go back to an even split. Let's not let inflation ruin our chance for a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Since the money is now worth 19% less than in the first round, an even split is actually less valuable than it was initially. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal, considering the decreasing value of the money.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is now worth 19% less than in the first round, and considering another 10% decrease in this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the significant decrease in value. I'll also try to convey this reasoning to Alice.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""With the money now worth 28.1% less than initially, I believe this split reflects the new reality.""}\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice!"
