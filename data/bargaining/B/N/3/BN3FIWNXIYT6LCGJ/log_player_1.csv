"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,500 and I'll take $5,500. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, I think that's fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I lose only 5% of the value, I still get a good amount. But Bob loses 10% of the value, so he is more pressured to make a deal. I think I can get a better offer than this. I'll reject this proposal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new proposal.
