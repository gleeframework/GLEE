"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us a good chance to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, but I'm open to negotiation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining value. I'll try to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try to find a middle ground""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more balanced offer than Bob's previous one. I'm hoping Bob will consider this a fair compromise and accept it."
