"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but it still leaves a small amount for Bob. This is a good starting point for a negotiation, as Alice gets most of the pie while leaving room for Bob to potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

This offer is still favorable to Alice, but it reflects the inflation that's occurred.  Since Alice is the one making the proposal, she can still benefit from a larger share, but she needs to offer enough for Bob to potentially accept. This offer leaves room for negotiation while still giving Alice a significant majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer reflects the continued inflation, making Alice's share less attractive compared to the initial rounds. However, it's still a better deal than the 2000 offer from Bob in the previous round. By giving Bob a slightly bigger share, Alice might be able to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money Alice would gain.  It's still worth holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 

This offer is a 50/50 split, acknowledging the significant impact of inflation on both players. Given the declining value of the money, a compromise is likely the best strategy to avoid losing everything."
