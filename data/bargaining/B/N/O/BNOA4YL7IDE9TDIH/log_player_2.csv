Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  Let's meet in the middle while it's still worthwhile for you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. I need you to acknowledge the time pressure we're both under.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, you drive a hard bargain. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. While it's frustrating that Alice hasn't moved much in her offers, accepting her offer nets me a deal that's slightly better than her original offer once inflation is factored in. 

It's a tough choice, but the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me.
