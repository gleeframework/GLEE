"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100,000, and I'll take the rest. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that I get the bigger share, after all, I'm the one who is risking the most with this inflation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's the hero of this game, doesn't he?

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. But, I'm not willing to give up that much. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less in the first round and another 10% less in the second round), I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's only fair, considering the inflation is eating away at our potential earnings.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finally divide the money."
