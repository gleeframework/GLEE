I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
``` 

Since Bob rejected my initial offer and proposed a very unfair split in his favor, I'm lowering my own gain, but still aiming for a larger share. Given the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so 7200 reflects that. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a better offer than his last proposal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob keeps pushing for an unfair split, so I'm rejecting again. The inflation is hurting me, but I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240}
```

I'm continuing to lower my gain, but still aiming for a majority share.  The inflation is really biting now, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we're both losing money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, and I'm losing money every round with the inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4608, ""bob_gain"": 5392}
```

I'm  adjusting my offer again, taking the inflation into account and trying to find a compromise point.  It's getting risky, as we're running out of time, but I'm still hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable split."
