"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a generous offer and accept it!"

Since my $6,000 is now worth a fraction of its original value, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. I'll propose a higher amount for myself, but still leave some room for negotiation.
