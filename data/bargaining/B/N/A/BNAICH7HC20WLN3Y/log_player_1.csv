"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob thinks I was too generous in the first round!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits. With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'd be getting $540,000 in today's value.

I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 81% of its original value now (90% of 90%), I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 42-58!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to take a more even approach this time!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to calculate the value of the money in today's terms. With a 27.1% reduction from the original value, the money is worth 72.9% of its original value. So, I'd be getting $729,000 in today's value.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, but it's a decent offer...
