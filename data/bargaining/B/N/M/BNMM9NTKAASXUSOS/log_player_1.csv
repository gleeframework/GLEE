"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the stakes are high and we have 11 more rounds to go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, all or nothing! 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, that's a bold move from Bob!

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* Bob's offer: 0 (Alice gain) and 8,000 (Bob gain) in real value

I'm not going to fall for the ""all or nothing"" trap. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my proposal accordingly:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 60/40""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting 60% of the remaining $10,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the 80/20 ratio I want, keep going! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to nudge me towards the 80/20 ratio, eh?

Since the money is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* Bob's offer: 3,200 (Alice gain) and 5,280 (Bob gain) in real value

I'm not going to give in to Bob's pressure just yet. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to your target, but I'm not there yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, trying to inch closer to the 80/20 ratio while still keeping some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to my minimum, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

* Bob's offer: 1,280 (Alice gain) and 5,120 (Bob gain) in real value

I'm not going to give in to Bob's demands just yet. I'll try to hold out for a better deal.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger push towards the 80/20 ratio.

Since the money is worth 73.66% less due to inflation (67.23% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my proposal accordingly:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more confident!

Since the money is worth 79.03% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* Bob's offer: 200 (Alice gain) and 1,800 (Bob gain) in real value

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting desperate!

Since the money is worth 86.42% less due to inflation (79.03% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my proposal accordingly:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 1600,
  ""bob_gain"": 8400,

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of chances, take this or we both lose! 
# Alice gain: 400 
# Bob gain: 9600

Since the money is worth 86.58% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* Bob's offer: 64 (Alice gain) and 1,536 (Bob gain) in real value

I'm not going to accept this extremely lopsided offer. I'll try to make one final push, but I'm running out of options.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's almost over!

Since the money is worth 92.04% less due to inflation (86.58% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my proposal accordingly:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640,
  ""bob_gain"": 9360,
  ""message"": ""Last, last chance, take it or we both lose everything!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 6.4/93.6 split, trying to salvage what's left of the deal. It's a desperate attempt, but I'm hoping Bob will see the writing on the wall and accept this offer.

This is my last chance to make a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to accept that we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: No more chances, take it or we both get nothing! 
# Alice gain: 200 
# Bob gain: 9800 
Do you accept this offer?","It's the final round!

Since the money is worth 91.41% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* Bob's offer: 16 (Alice gain) and 784 (Bob gain) in real value

I'm not going to accept this offer. With inflation, the actual value of the money is almost negligible. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this tiny amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I guess we both lose everything!"
