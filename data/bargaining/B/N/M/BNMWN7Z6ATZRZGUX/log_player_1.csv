"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! With the inflation, I'm losing value quickly. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject the offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is taking a toll on me! My offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, hoping to get a better deal before the value of my share drops further."
