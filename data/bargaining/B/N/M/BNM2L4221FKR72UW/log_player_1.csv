"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable this time.  I'm offering you a 40% share, which is still a good deal considering how the money's value will change for you in the coming rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
