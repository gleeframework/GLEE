"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split this 90/10, with me taking the bigger share.  It's a fair start, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept something, it's too early in the game. The money loses value for Alice faster than for you, so holding out for a better deal makes sense."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be more equitable this time.  I'm offering you a 40% share, which is still a good deal considering how the money's value will change for you in the coming rounds.""}
