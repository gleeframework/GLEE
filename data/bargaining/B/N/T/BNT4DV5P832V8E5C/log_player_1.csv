I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I want to secure most of the money while it's still worth the most to me.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer. I'm willing to lose some money, but I'm not going to let him get away with taking 80% of the money.  I'll take my chances and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to split the money more evenly this time.  I'm still taking into account the inflation rate, but I'm hoping that this will be a more appealing offer to Bob."
