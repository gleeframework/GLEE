"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the original amount, and Bob will get 10%. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split.  Let's end this quickly and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation rates. In the second round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll get 0.8 x 900000 = 720000, and Bob will get 0.9 x 100000 = 90000.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, since I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll get 0.8 x 720000 = 576000, and Bob will get 0.9 x 90000 = 81000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split. Let's see if Bob will accept this time.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split.  Let's end this now and both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth 48.8% less for me, so I'll get 0.52 x 576000 = 299520, and Bob will get 0.727 x 90000 = 65514.

I'll calculate the actual amounts I'd get if I accept Bob's offer: 0.52 x 400000 = 208000 and 0.727 x 600000 = 436920.

Since I'd get more in my previous offer, I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, the money is worth 61.36% less than in the first round for me, so I'll get 0.384 x 576000 = 220416, and Bob will get 0.727 x 81000 = 58869.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""A more generous offer. Will Bob finally accept?""
}
```"
