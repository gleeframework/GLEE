I'm taking a conservative approach for the first round. I want to maximize my share while still being fair enough that Bob might accept. We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While it may seem tempting to get something now, I'm playing the long game. Bob's offer is very unfair, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation hurts, but I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm raising my offer again. I'm willing to give Bob more, but I still need to get the majority share.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince him, as the inflation is starting to hurt."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While the inflation is biting hard now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm not giving up yet!  There's still a chance for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. The inflation is really hurting at this point, and I need to secure something before it gets worse. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise at this point."
