"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a classic game theory scenario.  While the offer seems tempting, it's risky to accept so early. Bob can potentially get a much better deal by rejecting and seeing what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is better than the first round, it's still significantly less than what Bob could potentially get.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a better deal, as the risk of getting nothing is higher with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
``` 

Bob is aiming to get a larger share in this round, taking advantage of the fact that Alice's potential gains are decreasing due to inflation.  This is a risky move, as Alice may reject and the potential for getting nothing increases with each round. However, it's a strategy to try and maximize his gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a turning point. While the offer isn't ideal, the risk of rejection is now very high. With each passing round, the potential for both parties getting nothing increases significantly. Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees some return and avoids the risk of losing everything."
