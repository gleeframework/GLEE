"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can have the smaller share, I'll take the larger one.""
}
```

I'm making a proposal to split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor, and I'm leaving a message for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 5% less, so I'd be getting $450,000, which is still a significant amount. Considering Bob's message, I think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
