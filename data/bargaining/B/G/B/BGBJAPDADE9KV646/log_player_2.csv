Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it more evenly, but I still need a bigger share considering the inflation hurts you more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
