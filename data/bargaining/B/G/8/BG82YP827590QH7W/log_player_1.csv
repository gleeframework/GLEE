"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Accept and we can finish.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 30, but I think I deserve more since I'm making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, my gain of $30 in this round is equivalent to $24 in the first round.

I'm not convinced that I deserve less than 40% of the original $100, considering the offer I made in the first round was already a fair split. Bob's offer seems a bit too generous to me.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think 30 is too low for me. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds (80% of 80% = 64%), my gain in this round is worth 64% of the original $30, which is $19.20.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50. No more negotiations.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 50% of the original $100, which is $50, and I'll take the other 50%, also $50."
