"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but leaves Bob with something. This is a good starting point, as it shows I am willing to negotiate but am also aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is fair and gives me a decent amount of money, especially considering the inflation factor. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
