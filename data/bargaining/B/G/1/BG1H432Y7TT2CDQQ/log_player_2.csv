Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we adjust our shares to 540000 for me and 460000 for you. This maintains a similar ratio to the previous offers but accounts for the decrease in value. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000
