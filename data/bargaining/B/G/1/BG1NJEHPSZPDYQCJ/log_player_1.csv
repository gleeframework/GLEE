"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both have the opportunity to get more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, the new values are:

Alice's gain: $4000 / 0.8 = $5000 (in the previous round's value)
Bob's gain: $6000 / 0.8 = $7500 (in the previous round's value)

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to get a higher share of the money, so I'll accept it.
