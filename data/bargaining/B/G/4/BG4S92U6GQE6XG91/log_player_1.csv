"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slightly larger share this round, but we can still get closer to a fair split in the future 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll offer a slightly higher share for myself, but still leave some room for Bob to accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, let's try to find common ground""
}
