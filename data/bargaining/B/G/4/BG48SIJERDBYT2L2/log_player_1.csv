"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering you $30, and I'll get $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd better take a larger share this time.
