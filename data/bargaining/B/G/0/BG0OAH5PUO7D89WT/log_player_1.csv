"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a good deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous starting offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make an even better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive in this offer, while still being reasonable. The money is worth even less due to inflation, so I need to be careful not to give away too much."
