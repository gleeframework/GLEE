"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering you 300,000 dollars, which is a very fair share considering the initial amount. If you accept, we can split the 1,000,000 dollars and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to make an offer! I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting 20% less than I would have gotten in the first round, but Bob is getting 5% less than he would have gotten in the first round. This offer is not as favorable to me as it was to Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me again, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any more generous, are you?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting any more generous 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to carefully consider this offer.

However, since I'm getting a slightly better deal than in the previous round, and Bob is still not getting any more generous, I'll accept this offer.
