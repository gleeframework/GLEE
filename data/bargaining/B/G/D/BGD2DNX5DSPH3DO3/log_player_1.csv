"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get the ball rolling! Accept and we can finalize the division.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets $0. This is my opening offer, and I'm hoping Bob will be eager to accept it and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair share, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a good starting point for negotiation.

I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $80 and Bob will take $20."
