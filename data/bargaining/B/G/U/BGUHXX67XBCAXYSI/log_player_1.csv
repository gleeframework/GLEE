I'll take the lion's share, leaving Bob with a dollar.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept this in the first round, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to take the 600,000 now than risk getting less in future rounds. Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm assuming he's aware of the inflation and is willing to play hardball."
