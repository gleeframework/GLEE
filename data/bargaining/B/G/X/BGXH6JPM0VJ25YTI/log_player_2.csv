Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but we need to move faster. This offer is better for you than the last one, and it's fair for both of us. Accept it, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the time pressure and inflation against me. While her offer is better than the first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about a more equitable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end. This offer is the best I can do right now.  It's still a good deal for you, and it helps us both avoid losing everything.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but I need to hold firm. She's still heavily favoring herself, and while the clock is ticking, I believe I can get a better deal. Accepting now would reward her stalling tactics."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting very close to the end. I'm willing to give you a good amount, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable share as well. This is a fair offer, and it's the best I can do at this point. Let's end this game on a good note. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, and her offer is getting closer to reasonable. However, she's still aiming for a 70/30 split, which is significantly in her favor.  With six rounds left, I think I can push for a more equitable outcome, even though the risk of getting nothing is increasing."

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're in the final stretch. This is a significant offer, and it's my last. It's the best we can do given the current situation. Accepting it is better than risking getting nothing at all. Think about it! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, and Alice is unlikely to offer anything better. This offer is better than anything she has proposed so far.  It's not perfect, but with the rapidly approaching deadline and the risk of getting nothing, accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. Holding out for a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds is too risky at this point."
