"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal division of the $10,000 to ensure fairness and mitigate the risk of inflation for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
