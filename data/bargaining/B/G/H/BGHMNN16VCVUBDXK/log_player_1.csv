"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
``` 

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, aiming to get the majority of the money quickly. I figure Bob might be tempted to accept, even with a small share, since the money is worth much less to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, but I'm not going to give in that easily. I'll reject his offer and see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm lowering my offer a bit to be more reasonable.  Bob's offer was way too lopsided, and I think he'll realize he needs to compromise if he wants to get anything at all."
