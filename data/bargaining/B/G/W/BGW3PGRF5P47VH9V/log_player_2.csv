"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer won't be as appealing in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I have an incentive to reach an agreement quickly, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I believe this is a fair offer.""}\n\n###\nI've taken into account the effects of inflation on both our parts and tried to propose a division that is somewhat in the middle, slightly adjusted for the fact that inflation impacts me more significantly. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Alice, as it still gives her a larger share but also considers my position and the devaluing of the money over rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation, Alice's offer of $3200 for me in round 3 is actually more valuable than it seems when compared to the potential offers in future rounds. Given that the money's value decreases by 20% for me with each round, and we're already in round 3, holding out for a better offer in subsequent rounds becomes less appealing. Alice's gain of $6800, although larger, also suffers from inflation but at a much lower rate, making her offer relatively stable in value compared to mine. Since Alice framed this as her final offer, and considering the diminishing value of potential future offers due to inflation, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action to ensure I get the most value possible from the game."
