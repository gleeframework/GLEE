"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a decent share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a fairer split. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider that Bob's offer will be worth even less next round if I reject it.  Let's calculate:

* **If I reject:** In Round 3, Bob's offer of $60 will be worth 20% less to him due to inflation, making it $60 * 0.8 = $48. 
* **Current offer:** Bob's current offer of $60 is already worth only $48 to him due to the inflation from round 1.

This means if I reject, Bob is likely to offer me a worse deal in the next round. It's better to accept a less than ideal offer now than risk getting a much worse one later.
