  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so $400,000 is now worth $380,000 to me.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I should reject it. I'd rather wait for a better offer that takes into account the inflation effect on both of us.

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 58% is fair. Your turn!""
