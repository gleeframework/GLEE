"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and I'll take $8,000, which is 80% of the original amount. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept a relatively small share."
