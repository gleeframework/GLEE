"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent amount to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round, as the value of the money will decrease for me if I accept now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be a little more even-handed this time. I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I also need to get a fair share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can meet in the middle this time.  I'm willing to give you more, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option.  The money Alice is offering is still a considerable amount, and rejecting it might lead to a worse offer in the next round."
