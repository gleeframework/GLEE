Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars.  This seems like a fair starting point, giving me a larger share as the initial proposer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, the inflation means my share is worth significantly less than in the first round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm lowering my proposed share to 60 dollars, but still offering Bob a significant amount. Given the inflation, I need to be more strategic with my proposals."
