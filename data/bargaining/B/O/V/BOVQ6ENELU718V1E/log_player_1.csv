"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take this generous offer and let's end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, with the message ""Take this generous offer and let's end the game early!"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, no need to rush 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less for me, but I can still consider the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering the money is worth less for me due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2 for me. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with the message ""You're not getting off that easy!"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too aggressive, let's find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth significantly less for me due to inflation. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as the reduced value of the money makes $4,000 a more attractive option than potentially getting less in future rounds."
