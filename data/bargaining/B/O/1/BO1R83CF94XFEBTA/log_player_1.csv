"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's end the game""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting less than half, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50.5/49.5 split, but I'll consider it. Since my money is not affected by inflation, I'll still get $500,000, which is more than Bob's share.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly more uneven split, but still a fair deal""}

I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a 50/50 split. I'm proposing a 47.5/52.5 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise."
