Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one! It's getting tempting to accept, but here's why I think it's still worth holding out:

* **Time Pressure:** Alice knows time is on her side. As the rounds go on, the deal gets sweeter for her and worse for me. She's likely to start making more generous offers soon.
* **50/50 Was Rejected:**  She already rejected a 50/50 split, which suggests she might be willing to go even further in my favor if I hold my ground.

It's a gamble, but I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can push Alice towards a more favorable deal in the next round or two."
