I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  I figure Bob might be happy with a small share, and it's better to get something than risk losing it all to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a real threat. It's better to take 50% now, knowing that it's worth less, than to risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
