"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially since my gain is worth less than Bob's gain due to inflation. However, I don't want to be too greedy, so I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 80% of 80% of the original amount. So, my gain is now worth 64% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take 64% of the original $100, leaving Bob with 36%."
