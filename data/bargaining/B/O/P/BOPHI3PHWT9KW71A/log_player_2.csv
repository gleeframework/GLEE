Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was quite low. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This reflects the risk I'm taking by enduring inflation.  If you decline, the value for both of us decreases.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both take a hit from inflation, but at least we'll both get something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
