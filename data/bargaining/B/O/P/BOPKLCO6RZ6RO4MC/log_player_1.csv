Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  I'm not sure how inflation affects him, but I want to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing.  Bob's offer is still significantly more than his original offer, and I don't know how much more inflation will impact him in the next round.  Accepting now is the safest option."
