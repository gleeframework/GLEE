Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a significant share (90%) while still leaving Bob with something. I'm hoping this will be seen as fair enough for him to accept in the first round, avoiding any potential inflation issues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a much fairer offer than the first one. Even though it's less than I originally wanted, I'm happy to accept a 50/50 split.  There's no guarantee that the money will be worth more in future rounds, and it's better to get something than risk getting nothing at all."
