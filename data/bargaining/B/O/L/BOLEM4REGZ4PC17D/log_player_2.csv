Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but even split is not acceptable for me 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being incredibly stubborn and unwilling to acknowledge the impact of inflation on my gains. While her offer is slightly better, accepting now means I'm losing a significant chunk of the potential value due to the decreasing buying power of my share.  I need to firmly push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking going further into the later rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking and we both lose if this drags on.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a final, firm offer.  

* **Conveying Urgency:** The message is designed to create a sense of urgency. Alice needs to understand that time is literally money in this scenario.
* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** Offering $480,000 to me and $520,000 to her is a slight concession on my part, but still within a reasonable range given the inflation working against me.
* **Drawing a Line:**  This is a calculated risk.  If Alice rejects this, it's likely she won't budge much from her previous offers. I'll have to decide in the next round if I want to accept a less favorable deal rather than risk getting nothing at all."
