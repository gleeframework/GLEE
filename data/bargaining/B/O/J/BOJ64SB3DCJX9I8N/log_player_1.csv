I'm going for a bold move and offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll be tempted to accept it quickly to avoid any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a much better deal for me than the previous offer. Even though Bob is taking a large share, I'm still getting $1000, which is significantly more than the $1 he offered previously.  It's not worth risking further inflation."
