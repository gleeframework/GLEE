"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob, considering the inflation disadvantage you'll face.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** A near-even split seems fair initially, but...
* **Inflation Factor:** Bob's money loses value faster. Offering him slightly less incentivizes him to accept *now* rather than risk getting a worse deal later.
* **Message:**  The message aims to be persuasive without being aggressive, acknowledging the game's dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split more evenly, accounting for the inflation I'll face in the next round.  This offer gives you a good amount, and it's fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Bob's offer is shifting the split in his favor, even accounting for the inflation he faces. 
* **Future Leverage:** If I reject this round, I propose in Round 3. By then, the inflation will make Bob even more eager to avoid further losses. This gives me more leverage to negotiate a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob's offer won't get much better, the potential reward of getting a larger share by waiting one more round seems worth it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this deal is better for you than what you'll get in round 4 with the inflation working against you.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Sweet Spot:** This offer is a slight improvement for me compared to Bob's offer in Round 2, while still offering him a bit more than he'd get if he waited for Round 4.
* **Time Pressure:**  By now, Bob is aware of the shrinking pie. Emphasizing the disadvantage of further delay adds pressure for him to accept.
* **Avoiding Greed:** While I could aim for an even larger share, pushing too hard might make Bob reject the offer out of principle, leading to a worse outcome for both of us."
