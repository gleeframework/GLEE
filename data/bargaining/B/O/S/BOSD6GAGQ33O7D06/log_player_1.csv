Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer, but let's not waste time. A 50/50 split seems fair and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats into the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the offer is a 50/50 split, and considering the impact of inflation on future rounds, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable decision to ensure a fair share of the money."
