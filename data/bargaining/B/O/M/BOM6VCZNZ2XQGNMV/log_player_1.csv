"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to get the game started, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 90%, I'll give you 80% 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself, but not too high, since I want to leave some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you 40% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more generous offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough. Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth less than my gain in previous rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the time running out!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the time is running out. I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself, but still leave some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, let's make a deal before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you 45% 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation! I'll have to think carefully about this one.

However, considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth less than my gain in previous rounds, and it's a relatively fair split. I'm running out of time, so I'll have to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $450,000 and hope it's enough to get me through the game!"
