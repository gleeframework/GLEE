Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fairness you mentioned, but since I'm facing less inflation, I'm offering you 40 and keeping 60. This way, we both get closer to a fair share, given the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
