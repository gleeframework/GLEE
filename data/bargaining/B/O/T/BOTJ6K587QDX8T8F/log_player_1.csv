"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, offering to split the money evenly between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll consider that when evaluating the offer. In terms of the actual value of the money, Bob is offering me $4000 and keeping $6000, which is a 40/60 split.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'll consider it for now. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting your offer, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 40/60 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to a 50/50 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's split it 55/45""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my number, but I'm still not there! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 45/55 split, which is even closer to my previous offer, I'll consider it. However, I still think I can do better.

Let's calculate the actual value of the money for Bob: $5500 is worth 51.2% of the original value, since it's 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%.

I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer, trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting, I'll make another offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 45/55 split, I'll try to push for a better deal. I'll make an offer that's closer to a 50/50 split, taking into account that the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer, let's meet in the middle""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want more! 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 42/58 split, I'll consider it. Let's calculate the actual value of the money for Bob: $5800 is worth 32.77% of the original value, since it's 100% - 67.23% = 32.77%.

I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer, trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth even less for Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting, I'll make another offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try again with a fair split""
}
```

I'm going back to my original offer from round 1, but considering the reduced value of the money for Bob."
