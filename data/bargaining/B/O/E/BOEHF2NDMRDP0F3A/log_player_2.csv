"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total value of the money is now 90% of 100$ for me and 95% of 100$ for Alice.

I'll propose a division of 40 for me and 60 for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 38.75 
# Alice gain: 61.25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, the money is worth even less now.

I'll think for a moment...
