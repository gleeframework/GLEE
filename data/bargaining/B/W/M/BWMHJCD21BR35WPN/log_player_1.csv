"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took less in the first round, now it's my turn to take more. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, my gain of $6,000 is still the same, but Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth 5% less, which is $3,800.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, as Bob is now taking a larger share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You took more in the last round, now it's my turn to take more""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to $5,500, while leaving $4,500 for Bob. I'm framing it as a response to Bob's previous move, hoping to regain some ground."
