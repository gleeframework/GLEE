"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining funds in future endeavors!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a decent amount, but I'm keeping the majority of the funds for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and move on to more lucrative opportunities."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I don't think splitting it down the middle is a fair deal, considering the initial proposal I made was already generous. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking a toll, and I need to adjust my strategy. Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a more modest proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me, considering the initial offer I made.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give in too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now! My gains are dwindling rapidly. Considering the offer, I think I can do slightly better than this, but it's getting harder to be picky.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with diminishing returns.
