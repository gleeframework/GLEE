"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 90% of the money and give Bob 10%. This leaves me with a good starting point, but it's generous enough to potentially convince Bob to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split is fair, I believe I can still do better.  I'm willing to wait and see what Bob offers in the next round.  The inflation hurts, but I can still gain more than 500,000 if I play it right."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 600,000 for myself.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a deal done.  This offer is still very favorable to me, but it shows a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming more favorable to him, and the inflation is really starting to hurt me. However, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to give me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm raising my offer again, but this time it's by a smaller amount. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to concede a little bit more, but I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split just yet. The inflation is making it harder to keep the money, but I'm still hoping to make the most of it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is really starting to take its toll, but I still believe I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is getting increasingly favorable to him, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The inflation is getting worse, and I'm starting to run out of time.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal for both of us. It's getting risky to wait longer, and I don't want to end up with nothing."
