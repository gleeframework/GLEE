"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to the higher inflation rate affecting my share.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a more balanced offer. Your higher inflation rate is accounted for, but I also need to consider mine. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting as it's better than nothing, and my share will keep shrinking. However, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I think I can negotiate a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my share is eroding quickly. This offer is a compromise - still better for you in the long run, but fairer to me in the short term."" 
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but with the inflation rates, I still think I'm taking on more risk. This offer reflects that. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is stubbornly sticking to his advantage! While 4200 is still a significant sum, accepting this offer would mean losing almost half of the initial amount due to inflation. It's time to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to walk away if necessary.
