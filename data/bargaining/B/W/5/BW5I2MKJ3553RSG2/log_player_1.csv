"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice, given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  While the money is worth less to me each round, I think a fair 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
