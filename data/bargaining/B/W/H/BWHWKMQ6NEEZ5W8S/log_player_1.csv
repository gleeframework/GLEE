"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 

I propose a 51/49 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point given the uncertainty of inflation and the possibility of Bob rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a better split in my favor, accepting this offer ensures I get some money.  Given the inflation, waiting for another round could result in me getting even less."
