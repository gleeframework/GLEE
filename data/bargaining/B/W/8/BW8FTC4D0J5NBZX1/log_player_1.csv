"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more fair split. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is worth 90% of 60, so it's a decrease of 10% from the first round.

I'm not convinced that 55/45 is a fair split, especially considering I had proposed 60/40 initially. I'd like to counter with a slightly better offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 81% of 60 (90% of 60 is 54, and 10% less is 4.7, so 54 - 4.7 = 49.3, but I will round to 49 for simplicity), which is 49.

I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. 55/45 is a good compromise.""
}"
