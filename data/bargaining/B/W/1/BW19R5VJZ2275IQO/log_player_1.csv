"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest way to divide the money and avoids the risk of inflation eating away at our gains in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
