"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70% and you can have 30%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting my end more harshly. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but still a fair offer. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances the inflation effect with a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, especially since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'll take the offer and call it a day!"
