"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take a small share now, and we can both benefit more in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to take the small share now, but I'm confident that I can get a better deal. I'll wait to see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I believe this is a fair split that considers the future value of the money. Let's end this now and both benefit from a larger share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can both do better if we keep negotiating.  Let's find a split that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than Alice's first one, I still believe I can get a larger share. The value of the money is decreasing with each round, but I'm willing to risk it to secure a better outcome. I'll see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable given the current value of the money and the risk of continued inflation. Let's end this negotiation now and avoid further losses.""
