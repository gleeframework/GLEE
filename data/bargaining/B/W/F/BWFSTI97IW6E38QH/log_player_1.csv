"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take 99 dollars, and Bob gets 1 dollar.  This is a very aggressive opening offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I'm not sure if I can do much better in the next few rounds.  It's a risk to reject and I'm not sure I want to gamble with the money."
