"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm offering Bob a significant share of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was initially. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. The gains are too equal, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, my gains are worth 10% less than in Round 2, and I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With my gains worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

However, Bob's offer is quite generous, and I don't see any reason to reject it. I'll accept his offer.
