"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split to start.  It's fair and avoids any immediate losses due to inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than the 50/50 split I initially proposed. Even with the 10% inflation, I'm better off waiting for my turn to propose again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

Since Bob's offer was worse for me, I'm going to try to flip the script. This round, I'm proposing a slightly better deal for myself, knowing Bob is facing a higher rate of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me, considering my 27.1% inflation. It's worth waiting for my turn to propose again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

Bob's inflation is hitting him hard. I'm going to propose a deal that is slightly worse for me than my previous offer, but hopefully good enough for Bob to accept before he loses too much more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's inflation is really starting to hurt him.  While this is still a worse deal than I'd prefer, it's better than risking another round and losing even more value."
