I propose that I get $900,000, and Bob gets $100,000.  I'm hoping this is fair enough for him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 400000

I'm going to try a more even split this time. Let's both get $600,000 and $400,000 respectively."

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'll reject this and see if Bob will budge in the next round."

I'll raise my offer slightly. I'll take $550,000, and Bob can have $450,000.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise."

This is getting a little risky, but I'll take the 50/50 split.  We're running out of time, and it's better than getting nothing!"
