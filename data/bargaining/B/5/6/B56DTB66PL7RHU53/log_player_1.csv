"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. Since the money depreciates quickly, I want to secure a large share in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get now. The money is losing value quickly, and Bob's offer is still a significant gain for me."
