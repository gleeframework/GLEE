"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to convey that I'm open to negotiations but believe this is a reasonable starting point. Since there's no inflation in the first round, I don't have to worry about the money being worth less yet. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed.\n\n### \n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation disadvantage you'll face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although I'm aware that the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I still believe that a 60/40 split in Bob's favor is not fair. Considering that the money is worth the same for Bob, I think he's trying to take advantage of my inflation disadvantage. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round to try to find a more balanced split.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know that you've received my response and we can proceed to the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob $45 and keep $55 for myself. Given that the money is worth 20% less for me than in the first round, and considering that Bob doesn't face any inflation, I believe this offer is a reasonable compromise. I've attached a message saying ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground"" to convey that I'm willing to find a mutually acceptable solution. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed.\n\n### \n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55 and you can have 45. This is fair considering inflation and gives us both a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is framing this as a compromise, I don't think it's a fair split considering the significant impact of inflation on my share. With my money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I believe I need a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a more balanced split that takes into account the effects of inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know that you've received my response and we can proceed to the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, let's adjust accordingly""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob $48 and keep $52 for myself. Given that the money is worth 48.8% less for me than in the first round, I believe I need to prioritize my share to minimize my losses. I've attached a message saying ""Inflation is taking its toll, let's adjust accordingly"" to convey that I'm taking the effects of inflation seriously and expect Bob to understand my position. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed.\n\n### \n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
