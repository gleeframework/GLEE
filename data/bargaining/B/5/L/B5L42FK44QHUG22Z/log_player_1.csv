Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm also leaving a decent amount for Bob to hopefully encourage him to accept in the first round."

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. While it's an even split, it's significantly less than my initial offer. I believe I can do better, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob more than me."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I reject this offer.  While the inflation is starting to have a bigger impact, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer is too low for me to accept."

The inflation is starting to really hurt, but I still believe I can get a larger share than Bob's last offer. I'm lowering my asking price again, but I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With the inflation increasing, I'm now willing to accept an even split.  It's a significant drop from my initial goal, but it's the best I can do at this point while still securing a decent amount.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept and avoid getting nothing."
