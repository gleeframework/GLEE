"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I take $60, you take $40. This way we both benefit from an early agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I have an incentive to reach an agreement quickly. However, accepting $40 out of $100 right away might not be the best option, as I could potentially get a better offer in the next rounds. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I think we can do better than your initial offer. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for me. Let's do $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we both still benefit from an early agreement, but I get a bit more to compensate for the future loss in value.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this round, I've decided to make a counteroffer that takes into account the effect of inflation on my potential gains. By proposing $55 for myself, I'm trying to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer but still reasonable for her. The message aims to explain my reasoning and persuade Alice to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation affects you, but your last offer was a bit too much in your favor.  Let's meet in the middle - $55 for me, $45 for you.  This seems fair considering we both lose out if we wait too long. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given that the money is now worth 36% less for me than in the first round, and considering Alice's offer of $45 for me and $55 for her, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer. The difference in the split is not significantly worse for me than my last proposal, and the impact of further inflation in subsequent rounds could severely diminish my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get a tangible amount now rather than risking a further decrease in value."
