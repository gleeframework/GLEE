"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can do better than your initial offer. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for me. Let's do $55 for me and $45 for you. This way, we both still benefit from an early agreement, but I get a bit more to compensate for the future loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
