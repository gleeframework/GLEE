"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to consider that Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, but I'm still considering the original value of the money.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and suggesting a counter-proposal to meet in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get closer to 50%""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, trying to get closer to the 50/50 mark, while still giving Bob a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm getting greedy 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation effect on Bob's gain, I need to consider that his 80% share is actually worth much less than it seems.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not enough for me, I'd like a bigger share to compensate for the inflation""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as I think I deserve a larger share to account for the reduced value of his gain due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get closer to 50%""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, trying to get closer to the 50/50 mark, while still giving Bob a larger share."
