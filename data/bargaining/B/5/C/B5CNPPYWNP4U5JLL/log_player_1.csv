"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with the 70-30 split, especially considering the inflation factor that's working against me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This offer is a bit more generous to you, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to a fair split, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, and Bob's offers are getting more aggressive!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 65-35 split, especially considering the significant erosion of my purchasing power due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal and preserve some value for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's aim for a 50-50 split. It's the fairest way to divide the remaining value, considering inflation.""
}
```

I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
