"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90% - 10% split in my favor, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to negotiate and find a more favorable split for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start, and we can work from there if needed. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the money is worth less now, so I need to think carefully about the offer.

I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an even split, especially with the inflation factor. I want to keep negotiating to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 75% - 25% split in my favor, with me getting $750,000 and Bob getting $250,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I need to think carefully about the offer.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 55% - 45% split in my favor, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. It's not ideal, but I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower value money."
