"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a fair deal, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's find a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still a bit too generous to him, if you ask me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

In round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in round 2. So, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can end this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to squeeze out a bit more.

In round 4, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll need to adjust my strategy accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

In round 5, the money I gain is worth 69.04% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 315000,
  ""bob_gain"": 685000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, let's settle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns.

In round 6, the money I gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so I'll need to be even more careful with my offer.

However, Bob's offer is actually a bit more generous than my previous offer, and it's getting harder to say no.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
