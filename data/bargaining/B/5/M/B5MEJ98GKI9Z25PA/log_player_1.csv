"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. My decision is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```
I'll try to get a better deal this time!"
