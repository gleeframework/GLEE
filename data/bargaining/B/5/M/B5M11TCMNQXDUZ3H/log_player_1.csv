Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair 50/50 split. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe this is a good starting point given the uncertainty of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
