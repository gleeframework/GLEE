"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. I believe it's fair given the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm not going to accept a 3:1 split in the first round, especially with the potential for inflation. It's too risky to accept such a lopsided offer so early on. I'll try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
