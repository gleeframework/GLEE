Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping to secure a quick win. Since the money loses value with each round, I want to maximize my share as soon as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous offer, and the inflation is starting to bite. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a larger share. The inflation is making it more urgent to secure a deal, but I'm hoping that Bob will realize he can't get away with such a lopsided offer."
