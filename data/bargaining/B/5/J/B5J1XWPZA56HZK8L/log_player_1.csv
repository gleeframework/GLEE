"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 5% less, this offer seems reasonable. I'll accept it.
