"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a bit more since you're getting a bigger discount on each round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, I'm getting a bigger discount per round so I can likely get a better deal later.  I'll see what she offers in the next round."
