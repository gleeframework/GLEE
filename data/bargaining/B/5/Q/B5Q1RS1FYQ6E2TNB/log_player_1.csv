  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, it's a fair start!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 40/60, a bit more balanced 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57
Bob gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36

I'll think about it...
