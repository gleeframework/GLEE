500000.0,500000.0,Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
999999.0,1.0,I still think my previous offer is fair. You get more money every round you decline. Let's not waste time.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get at least 600k to make it worthwhile with the inflation. Let's find a compromise.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
999999.0,1.0,"I'm sticking to my initial offer. Every round you reject, the money you get shrinks due to inflation.  It's in your best interest to accept.",Alice,5,

300000.0,700000.0,"I'm starting to think you're being unreasonable. I'm offering a larger share, but this inflation is hurting me. Let's agree on something before it's too late.",Bob,6,

,,,Alice,10,reject
999999.0,1.0,"This is it. One last chance to be sensible. It's the best deal for both of us. I'm not going to change my mind, but this is our last chance. Accept now.",Alice,11,
