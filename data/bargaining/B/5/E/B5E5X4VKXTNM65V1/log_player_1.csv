```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}

This is a straightforward proposal, offering Bob a 50/50 split."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to accept an offer that gives me $4000, considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while the money Bob gains is worth 5% less. I'd like to propose a higher amount for myself to account for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll offer a higher amount for myself this time.

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I still don't want to accept an offer that gives me $4500, considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while the money Bob gains is worth more than 14% less than in the first round. I'd like to propose an even higher amount for myself to account for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll offer an even higher amount for myself this time.

  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more. This is my revised offer""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not falling for it. My offer remains the same. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $4500, considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while the money Bob gains is worth even more than 22% less than in the first round. I'll try to propose an even higher amount for myself to account for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down. I need a bigger share to account for inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing hard, but I'm not giving up yet. Let's meet in the middle again. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept the offer to split the remaining amount 50/50. It's not the highest amount I could have gotten, but it's a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the remaining 2 rounds."
