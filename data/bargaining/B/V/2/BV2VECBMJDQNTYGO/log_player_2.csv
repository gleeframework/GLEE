I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a fair split right now, I want to see if I can get a better deal with inflation on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking advantage of the inflation to ask for a slightly larger share, but I'm still willing to split it fairly. Let's see if you accept this offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While my share is slightly less than what I initially proposed, the inflation has already eaten away at the value of the money significantly. It's better to accept this offer and secure a decent gain rather than risk losing more in future rounds."
