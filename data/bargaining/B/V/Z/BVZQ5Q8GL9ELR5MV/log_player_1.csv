It seems like Bob is sticking to a strategy of offering a 200,000 increase in his share each round. If I accept now, I'll lose a lot of potential gain.  Let's see if Bob will continue this pattern and if I can get a better offer."

I'm going for a 50/50 split in this round.  The inflation is getting really severe now, and it's becoming more and more important to secure something. I'm hoping Bob will realize that the losses from further rounds will outweigh the potential gain from another round of negotiation."
