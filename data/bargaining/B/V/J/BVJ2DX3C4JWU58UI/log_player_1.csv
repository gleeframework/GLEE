"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 70% and you can take 30%""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide what to do."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I'll take 50% and you can take the other 50% 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the numbers are:

* My gain: $500,000 (down from $700,000)
* Bob's gain: $400,000 (down from $600,000)

I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
