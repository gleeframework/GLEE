9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair.  I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.  I think it's a good deal for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think a more equitable split is 55/45. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor.  Let's go with a 60/40 split.  That's a fair compromise considering the inflation we're both dealing with.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it down the middle.  It's a fair and simple solution that avoids further inflation.,Bob,4,
