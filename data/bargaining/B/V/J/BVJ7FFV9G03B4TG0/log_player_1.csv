"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm leaving room for negotiation, hoping Bob will be willing to accept a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $40 is equivalent to $32 in the previous round's value.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining money, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
