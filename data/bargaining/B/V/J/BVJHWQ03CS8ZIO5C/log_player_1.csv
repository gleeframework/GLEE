Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's keep it simple and fair: a 50/50 split.  No need to drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This is a slight improvement on your offer, acknowledging the time pressure we're both under. 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is now reasonably close to my initial proposal, and the time pressure is significant. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to agree in the remaining rounds."
