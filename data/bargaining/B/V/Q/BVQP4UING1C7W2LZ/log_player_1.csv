I propose to keep 999,000 dollars for myself, and give Bob 1,000 dollars.  This is a very generous offer, considering the inflation. I hope Bob sees reason and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
