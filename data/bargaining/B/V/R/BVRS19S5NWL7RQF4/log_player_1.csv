"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures a fair distribution considering the inflation rates.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60:40 is a more reasonable ratio, considering the inflation rates are not symmetrical. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but not as large as 3:1. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
