"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I still want a decent chunk too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth $63 (90% of $70).

I'm not sure I want to give up a significant portion of the money, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
