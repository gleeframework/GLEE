"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll take the lion's share, leaving Bob with a symbolic dollar. I'm hoping he'll accept it in the hopes of getting a better deal in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and it's better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other. I'll take it."
