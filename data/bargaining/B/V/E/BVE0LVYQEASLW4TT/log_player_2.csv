"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be efficient, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point.  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth exploring if we can negotiate a better deal for myself, especially since I have the opportunity to counter-propose."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a more even split is fair. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial outcome.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. This offer is a compromise to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is a real concern.  Alice's offer is closer to my ideal than my previous offer, and it's likely she'll continue to push for a more advantageous split in future rounds. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent share of the money before the inflation significantly impacts my gains."
