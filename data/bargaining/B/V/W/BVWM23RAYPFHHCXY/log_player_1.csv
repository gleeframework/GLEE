"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get more, but Bob's offer is still a decent one. I'll accept it.
