700000.0,300000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 70:30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures we both get a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,

200000.0,800000.0,"I'm taking a risk by offering you a smaller share, but I think we can do better than your initial proposal. This way, we both get a larger share now, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money's value decreasing further.",Bob,2,

640000.0,360000.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose a new 64:36 split. This aims to balance our shares while minimizing the impact of the decreasing money value. I hope this proposal is more acceptable.",Alice,3,
