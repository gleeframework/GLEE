Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your share is losing value fast. I'm offering a deal that still benefits you greatly considering the inflation. Don't let greed cloud your judgment. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
