"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 9,000 to 1,000 split, with me taking the smaller share this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to start with a balanced split, taking into account that the value of the money might change in the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual amount I'll get as 0.95 * 1000 = 950.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better proposal, considering the decreasing value of the money I'll gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share this round, but I want to keep some buffer for future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing an 8,000 to 2,000 split, with me taking the larger share this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time to move closer to a more even split.  Let's start with 60/40 this time, keeping in mind that the value of money might change in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting harder!

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual amount I'll get as 0.85 * 1000 = 850.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40% share, considering the decreasing value of the money I'll gain."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share this round, but I want to keep some buffer for future rounds and account for the increasing inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7,000 to 3,000 split, with me taking the larger share this round."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual amount I'll get as 0.77 * 1000 = 770.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 30% share, considering the decreasing value of the money I'll gain. I'm trying to hold out for a better deal."
