"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, it's a gamble. However, it's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is quite the opposite of my first offer, so I'm going to reject this one.  I have 10 more rounds to see if we can come to a more fair agreement.  I'm also going to keep in mind that inflation is in play, so I need to make sure my offers reflect that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

Since Bob seems to be aiming for a much larger share, I'm going to adjust my offer down, but still keeping a significant majority.  I need to account for the inflation, but also show I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob seems to be taking advantage of inflation. I'm still going to reject this offer. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds, even with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair offer, considering the inflation and Bob's previous attempts to grab a larger share.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see the benefit of accepting before the remaining rounds push us further into the negative effects of inflation."
