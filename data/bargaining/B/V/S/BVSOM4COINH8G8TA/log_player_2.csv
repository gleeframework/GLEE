"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80, 
""alice_gain"": 20, 
""message"": ""You started with a 60-40 split, I'm trying to get a better deal. Let's meet in the middle.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. 50-50 is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less for Alice, I'll consider that in my decision. In the first round, the offer was 60-40, which is a 60% gain for Alice and 40% gain for Bob. If we apply a 19% reduction to Alice's gain, we get 48.4% gain for Alice and 51.6% gain for Bob. Since Alice's current offer is 50-50, which is closer to my preferred 51.6% gain, I'll accept this offer.
