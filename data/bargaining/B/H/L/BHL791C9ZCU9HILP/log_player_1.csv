"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share for now""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my calculation.

If Bob's gain is worth 10% less, that means he's offering me $5000, which is equivalent to $5000 / 0.9 = $5555.56 in the original amount.

I think I can do better than that!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less from the previous round), I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to be generous""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
