"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose taking 90 dollars and giving 10 dollars to Bob. I want to secure the majority of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to accept this offer. Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal, the inflation means that rejecting and going to the next round is a huge risk.  It's possible that we might not reach a deal by round 12 and get nothing. It's better to secure half the money now."
