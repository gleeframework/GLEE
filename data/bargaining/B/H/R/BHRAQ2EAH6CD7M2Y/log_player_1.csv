I propose to keep 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm going to propose a more even split this time. We're both losing money with each round, so I think it's time to compromise a bit."
