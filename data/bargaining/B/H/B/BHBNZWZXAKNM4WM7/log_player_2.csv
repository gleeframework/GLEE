Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  While the offer seems worse than the first round at face value, it's important to consider the inflation. 
* **Bob's Loss:** Bob loses 19% of the value of his potential gain. This means the offer is worth roughly $3,040 in Round 1 terms.
* **Alice's Loss:** Alice loses 9.75% of the value of her potential gain, making her offer worth roughly $5,425 in Round 1 terms.
* **Negotiation:**  It's likely Alice will offer even less in the next round, potentially making a worse deal for Bob.  Accepting this offer guarantees a gain, even if it's a smaller one."
