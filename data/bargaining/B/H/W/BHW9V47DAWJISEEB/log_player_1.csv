"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 55:45 in my favor.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of money is decreasing for me each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
