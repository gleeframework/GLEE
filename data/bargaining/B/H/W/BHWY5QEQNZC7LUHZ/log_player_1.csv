"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $6000, which is 60% of the total amount, and Bob would receive the remaining $4000, which is 40% of the total amount. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer, considering that I am taking on the risk of inflation by going first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, considering the inflation we need to account for. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I, Alice, am facing a 20% decrease in the value of the money I gain due to inflation, I need to take that into consideration when evaluating Bob's offer. In this round, Bob is offering me $4500, which, after accounting for the 20% decrease in value, is effectively worth $3600 (80% of $4500). Meanwhile, Bob would receive $5500, which retains its full value for him. Given this disparity and the impact of inflation on my share, I believe the offer is not favorable enough for me to accept. Therefore, I decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal despite the risk of further inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, considering the inflation and its impact on my potential gain, I need to adjust my offer to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Given that the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round and will continue to decrease, I must factor this into my proposal. I decide to offer Bob a slightly larger share than before to incentivize him to accept, while also trying to maximize my gain considering the circumstances.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
