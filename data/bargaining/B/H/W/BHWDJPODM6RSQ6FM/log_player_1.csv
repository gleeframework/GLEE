Let's start with a fair split. I propose 50 dollars for each of us."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'll raise my offer slightly. I propose 45 dollars for me, and 55 dollars for Bob.  This is still a fair split considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's getting risky to keep rejecting, I'll accept this offer."
