I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping to get the game over quickly. The inflation might make it less attractive for him to wait for a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than my previous one, but I still believe I can do better. The inflation is impacting the value of the money, but I'm willing to risk it for a higher share. I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself than in round 1, while still offering a significant amount to Bob. I'm hoping that the inflation will incentivize him to accept, as he's likely to get less if he waits for another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation has hit me hard, I'm still not willing to accept a 300k offer.  I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. After multiple rounds of rejection, I think it's time to compromise and settle for a fair share.  With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing for both of us, and I don't think we can get much more than this."
