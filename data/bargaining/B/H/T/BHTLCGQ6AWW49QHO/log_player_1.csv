"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, this offer is quite skewed in his favor. I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was quite lopsided, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

This way, I'm trying to get a larger share of the remaining money, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at Bob's gain, his offer seems less generous than it initially appears. Considering the value of money is decreasing, I'll think twice before accepting a relatively small share for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was still quite close to a 50/50 split, I'll try to push for an even more favorable deal this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm trying to take advantage of the accelerating inflation to get a larger share of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's gain by almost 70%, his offer seems relatively generous compared to the previous rounds. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of money, I think this is a decent compromise.
