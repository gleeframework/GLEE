Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too lopsided. Let's meet in the middle at 65/35. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still getting the lion's share, and the inflation is hurting me more than her.  It's risky, but I need to push for a better deal while I still have some leverage."
