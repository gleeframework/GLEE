"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'd rather not accept a 60/40 split. My gain would be $4,000, which is worth 10% less than my initial proposal of $7,000. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll propose a slightly lower amount for myself to account for the decreasing value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more balanced split.""
}
```"
