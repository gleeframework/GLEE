"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, it's actually a worse deal for me than the 50/50 split I proposed in the first round. However, it's still a better deal than the 40/60 split that would result from another round of inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
