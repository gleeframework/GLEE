Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Take this offer while it's still good, as the value decreases for you with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
