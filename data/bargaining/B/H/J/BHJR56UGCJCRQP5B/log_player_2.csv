Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split the money 60/40, ensuring we both get a fair share. This is a good opportunity for us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is more reasonable now, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Remember, her perceived value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to the 20% inflation rate she experiences each round. My value remains constant. This means I have more leverage as the game progresses.  I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking and inflation is eating away at your share. Let's be realistic â€“ my offer is more than generous considering the circumstances."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I've increased my demand slightly from the last round.  This might seem risky, but it plays on the psychological pressure Alice is under.  Her perceived value of the money is decreasing, and each round she rejects makes my offers comparatively better. This strategy aims to push her towards a quicker agreement, albeit on my terms."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money with every passing round. Let's split it down the middle - 50/50 - and ensure we both get a decent amount. This is the best option for us both in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

A 50/50 split is now a favorable deal for me. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiations.  Delaying further significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Alice's Perspective:** While a 50/50 split seems fair at face value, Alice is losing value rapidly due to inflation. To her, this deal is worth significantly less than it was in earlier rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Gain:**  Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant sum of money. Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is increasingly risky."
