"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I'm not going to give away all my share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm still willing to compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the total amount of money is still $10,000, but the value of the money has changed due to inflation.

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
