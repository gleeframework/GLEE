"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nHow's that? I offered Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better for both of us. This is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can do better than 40% of the money, especially since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nSince Bob's gain is worth 20% less each round, I think I can try to take a bit more. But I'll still offer him a decent amount to try to reach an agreement. Let's see what he says!"
