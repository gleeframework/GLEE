Let's see if Bob is greedy or wants to work together.  I'm starting with an offer heavily in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept a deal where I only get 10% of the money. I'll wait and see if he's willing to be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Let's try a more even split.  This way we both get something fair, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation."
