# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 20-80 split. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.
