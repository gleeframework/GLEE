"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 80% of the original $50, which is $40. Bob's gain of $50 is now worth 90% of the original $50, which is $45.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'd rather try to get more. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. My gain of $40 from the previous round is now worth 80% of the original $40, which is $32. Bob's gain of $45 is now worth 80% of the original $45, which is $36.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but not too much""
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the remaining value, and Bob will get 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $55 from the previous round is now worth 51.2% of the original $55, which is $28.16 (but due to the 48.8% decrease, it's actually $28.16 * 0.5168 = $14.53). However, since we're considering the original $55, I'll use that value.

Bob's gain of $45 from the previous round is now worth 72.9% of the original $45, which is $32.805 (but due to the 27.1% decrease, it's actually $32.805 * 0.727 = $23.83). However, since we're considering the original $45, I'll use that value.

But since we're considering the original $55 and $45, I'll use those values.

Considering the values, my gain of $45 is now worth 45% of the original $100, which is $45. Bob's gain of $55 is now worth 55% of the original $100, which is $55.

I think this is a pretty good deal for me, but I'm not sure if I should take it.
