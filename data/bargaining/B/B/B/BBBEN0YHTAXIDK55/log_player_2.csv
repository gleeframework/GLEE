Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk too.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a more even split. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I still need a larger part to compensate for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hitting her harder than me, so she's feeling the pressure to secure a deal. I believe I can get a more favorable outcome by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
