"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share to try to convince him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's settle this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'd get 4800$ instead of 6000$. But in the second round, Bob's offer is 5000$ for me, which is actually more than I would get in this round if I accepted his offer. However, I'm not sure if he'll make a better offer in the next round.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if Bob will make a better offer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%). So, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5120,
  ""bob_gain"": 4880,
  ""message"": ""You're not making it easy, but I'll give you a fair deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's wrap this up! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, so I'd get 5120$ instead of 6000$. But Bob's offer is 5500$, which is more than I would get in this round if I accepted his offer.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slightly better deal than what I would get in this round.
