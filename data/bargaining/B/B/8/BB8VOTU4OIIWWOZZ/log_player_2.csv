Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant. Rejecting this offer and going to another round means I'm likely to get even less in real terms. It's better to take the guaranteed $430,000 now (worth $348,350 in round 1 value) than risk getting a worse deal later."
