"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more for my part in this negotiation 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more, huh?

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you a 60/40 split. I think I deserve a fairer share.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counter-proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 55/45 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 52/48 is a more reasonable compromise considering the original offer was 50/50 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give him such a big share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 52/48 split. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to push for an even better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52.5/47.5 is a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's closer to my original 50/50 proposal, but still gives Bob a bit more than his previous offer."

# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a slightly better deal, considering the negotiations so far 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's still trying to squeeze out a bit more, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give him that last 1%.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept your offer. 51/49 it is!""
}
```

I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to wrap up the negotiations here."
