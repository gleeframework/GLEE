"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll be eager to accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my share of 3000 is actually 2850 in real terms.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, since it's a decent compromise. I don't want to risk going to round 3 with even lower values.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
