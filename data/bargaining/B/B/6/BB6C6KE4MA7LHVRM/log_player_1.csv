"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game, hoping to set a fair tone and avoid unnecessary negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too generous!

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not give up 2/3 of the money right off the bat. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was too skewed in his favor, I'll try to propose a more balanced split. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair split""
}
```"
