"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
