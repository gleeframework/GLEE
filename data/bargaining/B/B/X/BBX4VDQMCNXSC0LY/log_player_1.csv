"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30% share, I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreased value of money, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are adding up! Considering the decreased value of money, I'll reevaluate the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as the 60% share is a reasonable compromise given the changing value of money."
