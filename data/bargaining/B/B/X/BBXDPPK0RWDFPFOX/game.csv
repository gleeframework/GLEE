900000.0,100000.0,I propose a fair split. Let's start with 900k for me and 100k for you.  We can negotiate further if you prefer.,Alice,1,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This accounts for the inflation that will affect you more in future rounds.",Bob,2,

400000.0,600000.0,"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but a 70/30 split is still too uneven.  I propose a 40/60 split,  which is closer to a fair compromise while still acknowledging the impact of inflation.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",Alice,3,
