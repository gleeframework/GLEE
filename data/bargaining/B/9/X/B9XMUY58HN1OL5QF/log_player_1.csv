"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I propose a 990,000 to 10,000 split in my favor. This is a very generous offer, given the potential for inflation, and I believe it is in Bob's best interest to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is in my best interest.  The inflation rate means my share is worth less with each passing round. It's better to take 700,000 now than risk getting nothing at all."
