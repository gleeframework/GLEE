"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair starting point. I'm willing to split the money 90/10 in your favor. Let's see if you're willing to work with me. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not sure Alice is serious about working with me. 90/10 is a huge difference! I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split. This is a much better starting point for us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too lopsided. Let's split it 55/45. This way we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, this is a significant improvement from the previous offer. I'm willing to accept and move on."
