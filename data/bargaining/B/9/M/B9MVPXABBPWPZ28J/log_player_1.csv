"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose taking $9,000 and leaving Bob with $1,000.  This is a pretty generous offer, as I believe I have a good chance of getting the other player to accept it in the first round.  However, if they decline, I'll need to adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a bad deal for me,  I am gaining less than half of the money and even though inflation has kicked in, I can still make a better offer in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm offering $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob.  Given the inflation, I believe this is a fair offer, and Bob might be willing to accept it to avoid further potential losses due to decreasing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is better than what I was able to secure in the previous round.  Given the inflation, I'm willing to accept this."
