"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 70/30, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, my initial $70 is now worth $63.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the second round, my proposal from the second round is now worth $56.10 for me and $42.90 for Bob.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise again, let's try to find a fair middle ground 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% decrease in value due to inflation, my initial $100 is now worth $72.90.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think a 50/50 split is a good compromise, especially since the money is losing value rapidly. I'll decide to accept it.
