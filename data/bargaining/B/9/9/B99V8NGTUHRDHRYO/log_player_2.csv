Let's see what I can do better!  I want to try and get more of the money, even with the inflation."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I believe this is a fairer split as the rounds go on. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is taking a toll. Accepting this offer ensures I get some money, even if it's less than I hoped for."
