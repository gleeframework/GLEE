7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair compromise considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the money will be worth less to you in the next round.  Let's be reasonable and finish this game.",Bob,2,
