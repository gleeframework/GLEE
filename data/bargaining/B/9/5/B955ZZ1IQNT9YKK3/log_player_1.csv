"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us going!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original $100, which is $70, and Bob will get $30. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get some money and avoid further negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $47.50, and Bob's gain of $50 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $40.

I'll think about it... Since Bob is offering a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer to get some money and avoid further negotiation. I'll take the $47.50.
