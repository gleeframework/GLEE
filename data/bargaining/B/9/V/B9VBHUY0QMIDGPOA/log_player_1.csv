"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $60 and Bob can have $40. The message is a brief explanation of the proposal, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while also favoring me slightly. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's start with that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, accepting $40 now would be equivalent to accepting $32 in the first round, which is less than what I initially offered to Bob. I'll reject and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll consider the inflation and try to find a mutually acceptable division. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust the proposal accordingly. I'll offer $58 for myself, which is slightly less than my initial offer, and $42 for Bob, which is more than what he would have gotten after the 5% reduction. The message will emphasize the need for compromise due to the inflation.\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
