"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering your offer in the last round and the fact that the money loses value faster for you. Let's get this settled. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
