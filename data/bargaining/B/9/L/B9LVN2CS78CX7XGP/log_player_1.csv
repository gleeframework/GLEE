```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can shake hands.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."

Round 2

# Bob's message: You're starting too low, I'll take more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much. Accept or we'll keep negotiating.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up enough, I'll take the middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up more than I did in my previous offer, and Bob's offer doesn't seem like a significant improvement. I'll try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal for myself, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small chance, meet me in the middle again. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I've been trying to negotiate for a better deal, but Bob's offer seems like a fair compromise. I'll take the 50-50 split, even if it's not ideal, to avoid further losses due to inflation."
