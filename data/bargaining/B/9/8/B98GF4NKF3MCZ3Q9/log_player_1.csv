"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a slightly larger share, but it's still a decent compromise. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the value of Bob's gain to my gain in the first round. In the first round, Bob's gain was 4000, which is worth the same as 5000 in the current round.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer since I'd get a smaller share in value than I would have in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 5500 for him and 4500 for me, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer him a slightly smaller share, but still a bit more than what I got in the first round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
