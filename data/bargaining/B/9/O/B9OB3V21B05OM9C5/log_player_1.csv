"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a slightly bigger share this round""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I'm framing this as a ""fair"" split, but I'm also taking a slightly bigger share to set the tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm open to negotiating further. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 51-49 split, but I'm willing to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still a compromise. I'm framing it as ""meeting Bob halfway"" to show that I'm willing to listen to his concerns and make a concession."
