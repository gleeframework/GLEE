"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Consider it! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 70% of $80 (20% less than $100) = $56
* Bob's gain: 30% of $80 = $24

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept Bob's offer.
