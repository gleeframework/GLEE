Let's start fair! 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
``` 

I'll offer 4000 for me and 6000 for Bob.  Since the money is worth less for me each round, I need to secure a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, I'd rather secure some than risk losing even more in the next round."
