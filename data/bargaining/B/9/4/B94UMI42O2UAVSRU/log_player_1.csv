Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80% of the initial value, but remember, it's still worth more than it will be in future rounds. Consider a more generous offer from you and we can end this sooner. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
