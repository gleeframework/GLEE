"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not willing to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

With the new offer, I'll get $6,000, which is 60% of the original $10,000. Considering the inflation, this is equivalent to about 75% of what I would have gotten in the first round.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is a fair and equal split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,500 in the previous round is now worth only 51.2% of the original $10,000. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll get $5,000, which is 50% of the original $10,000. This is a fair and equal split, and I think it's a good opportunity to settle.
