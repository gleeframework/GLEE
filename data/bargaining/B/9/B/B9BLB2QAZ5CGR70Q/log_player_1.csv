"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm aiming for a good starting point, but I'm aware that inflation might work in Bob's favor if we go to later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer. Even with the 5% inflation, I can do better by proposing a different split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm proposing an 8500/1500 split.  While Bob's offer was tempting, I believe I can still secure a decent share by taking into account the inflation, but I need to offer a bit more to ensure he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Although inflation is hurting my potential gains, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round.  I'll need to take a bigger hit on my proposed share to make it worth Bob's while."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm proposing a 7500/2500 split. While inflation is significantly impacting my gains, I'm still aiming for a favorable outcome. Bob seems to be demanding more, but I'm willing to compromise further to avoid a potentially worse outcome in future rounds."
