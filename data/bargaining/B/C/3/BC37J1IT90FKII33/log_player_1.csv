"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the cash, or let's negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the current value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finalize the split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Consider this one! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that the offer is significantly better than the previous one. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the 10% decrease in value for me and the 5% decrease for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob. Let's split it down the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000, which is a compromise that should be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still want a bit more. Consider this compromise! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $500,000. It's not ideal, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal due to further inflation."
