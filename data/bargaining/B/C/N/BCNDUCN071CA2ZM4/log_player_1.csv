"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair at this stage. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more advantageous offer this time. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get a 70% share of the original $1,000,000, which seems like a good compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

  ""bob_gain"": 150000
