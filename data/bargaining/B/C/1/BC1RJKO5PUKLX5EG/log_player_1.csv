"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start.""}\n\nI'm offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fair, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting $40 in the second round is actually worth less than the $40 I offered him in the first round. I believe we can negotiate a better deal for both of us. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, I'm adjusting my offer to $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. This way, we're meeting closer to the middle ground, taking into account the devaluation of the money for both of us. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
