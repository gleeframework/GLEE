"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5334,
""bob_gain"": 4666,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting serious. Let's be realistic - time is money. This offer is fair considering the inflation we both face.""
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Calculation:**  I'm aiming for a slightly better deal than Bob offered, acknowledging the increasing pressure of inflation. Each round is costing us both.
* **""Fairness"" Appeal:** The message emphasizes the offer's fairness given the circumstances, hoping to make Bob more receptive.
* **Urgency:**  Continuing to highlight the time sensitivity is key to push for a resolution before the value diminishes further."
