Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 45

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This is my last offer. It's heavily impacted by inflation, but I believe it's still acceptable for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really hurting you, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is experiencing significant inflation. Getting $42 now is better than risking even less in subsequent rounds.
* **Downward Trend:**  Alice's offers have been getting progressively worse for Bob.  It's unlikely she'll suddenly offer a significantly better deal.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks walking away with nothing if he loses in the next round.

While $42 is far from ideal, the impact of inflation makes it a better choice than risking a worse outcome."
