"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 80-20, a fair start!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more fair split. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to be more cautious.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, it's now worth 64% of the original amount. So, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4600,
  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""You wanted 60-40, but I'll give you 46-54. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}"
