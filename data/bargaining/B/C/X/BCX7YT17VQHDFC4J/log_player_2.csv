"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer.  While Alice's message is friendly, there's no guarantee that future offers will be as generous, and I want to see what kind of deals she's willing to make.  Plus, I want to see if I can get a better share!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. We can end this quickly and avoid any potential losses due to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said you wanted a 50/50 split, but I think I deserve more considering the risks and efforts I'm taking. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While her offer is slightly better than the first round, it's still significantly less than the 50/50 split I proposed. I'll keep pushing for a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I understand your desire for a larger share, but I believe a more balanced split is necessary. Let's meet in the middle. A 45/55 split is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our contributions.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not getting any younger, and the inflation is eating away at our potential earnings. I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too lopsided and her message is becoming increasingly aggressive.  The inflation is definitely a factor, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can negotiate a better split.  I'm not going to give in to her pressure tactics."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""With inflation impacting us both, we need to find common ground.  Let's try a 40/60 split. It's a compromise that acknowledges the pressure of time and the need to reach an agreement.""
