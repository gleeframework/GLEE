I'm going to start by being generous to Bob, but I want to make sure I get the majority of the money.  I figure if I'm too greedy, he might just reject it and then I'll be in a worse position in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a better deal, taking 75% now is better than risking getting less in the next round due to inflation."
