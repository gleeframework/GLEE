I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering a 6000/4000 split in my favor.  Bob's offer was too low, and I'm willing to take a slightly lower share to get the deal done."
