"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. It's too small for me, and I think I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500} 
``` 
I'm proposing a more even split. I believe this is fair and gives Alice a good share while also ensuring I get a decent amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is better than risking another round of inflation and potentially getting an even smaller amount."
