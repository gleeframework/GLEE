"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust if you're unhappy with it. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While a fair split sounds nice, a 10% share is too low. Let's see what Alice will offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair.  This will give us both a good share of the money, and it's a more balanced split than your initial offer."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 65/35 split is more fair. We can both get a good share of the money with this, and it's closer to my initial proposal. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's better to accept this offer.  With each passing round, the value of the money decreases, and Alice's offers are getting closer to what I'd consider fair. It's time to lock in this deal before inflation eats away at the potential gains any further."
