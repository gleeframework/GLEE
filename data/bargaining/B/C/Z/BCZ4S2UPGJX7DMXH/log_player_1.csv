Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 20% less this round, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him than my previous offer, I'll reject it.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a slightly better share. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer! Given the inflation, my gain is worth a lot less than it used to be, so I'll try to maximize my share. Since Bob's offer is closer to a 70-30 split, I'll accept it.
