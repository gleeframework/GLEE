Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 5500/4500 split. This is a fair starting point that gives me a slight advantage, but leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Since the money is worth less now, I am willing to share the remaining value equally. This seems like the fairest option considering the previous rounds."
