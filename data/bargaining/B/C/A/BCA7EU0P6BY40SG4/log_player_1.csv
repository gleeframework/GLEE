"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself slightly. Since we have 12 rounds, there's time to be more generous later if necessary. This initial offer is meant to establish a baseline and see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. After just one round, inflation has already decreased the value of my potential earnings. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and any further negotiation could risk losing everything."
