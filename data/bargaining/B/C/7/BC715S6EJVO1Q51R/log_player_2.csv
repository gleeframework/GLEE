"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  As Bob, I want to maximize my share. While 400,000 is a decent starting point, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer gives me the chance to propose a split more favorable to myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm open to a fair split, but I believe a 55-45 split better reflects our respective needs. Let's be practical and get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share. 58-42 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While inflation has reduced the value of the money, the potential gains from further negotiation are shrinking. Alice is offering a more favorable split than her previous offer, and given the risk of getting nothing at all, accepting seems like the best course of action."
