"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that heavily favors me. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share in the first round.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I want to maximize my gains early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action in this round.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm not sure if I can secure a better deal later on. It's risky to keep rejecting offers, especially with inflation affecting Bob's gains more significantly."
