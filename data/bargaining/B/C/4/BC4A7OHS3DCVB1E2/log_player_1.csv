"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% now.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather take the 5000 than nothing.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
