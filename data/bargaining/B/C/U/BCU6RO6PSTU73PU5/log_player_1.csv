I'm going to start with a relatively high offer for myself, but still leaving Bob with a small amount.  I figure it's a good starting point to see if he's willing to accept an uneven split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to have more than 5000, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting less in the next round.  I don't know what the inflation impact will be on me in the next round, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
