"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair one. I'll accept this offer.
