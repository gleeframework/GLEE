"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, and leaving 20% for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if we can agree 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $80 in Round 1 is now worth 80% of $80, which is $64.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I'll calculate my gain in terms of the original $100. If I accept his offer, I'll get $50, which is 50% of $100.

Since my gain in Round 1 was $80 (which is now worth $64), I'm actually doing worse in Round 2 if I accept Bob's offer. However, I don't know how Bob's gain is affected by inflation, so I'll have to consider the possibility that he's offering a better deal.

I'll decide to reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 80% of its original value, so my gain is worth 80% of 80%, which is 64% of the original $100.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but need more""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the original $100, leaving 30% for Bob. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the 4:1 ratio, but I'll hold firm 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money in Round 4. Since the money is worth 80% of its original value in Round 2, and 80% of 80% is 64% of the original value, and then it's worth 64% of that, which is 64% * 80% = 51.2% of the original value.

Now, considering Bob's offer in Round 4, I'll calculate my gain in terms of the original $100. If I accept his offer, I'll get $40, which is 40% of $100.

Since my gain in Round 1 was $80 (which is now worth 51.2% of $100), I'm doing better in Round 4 if I accept Bob's offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, and I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by inflation in the same way.

I'll decide to accept the offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
