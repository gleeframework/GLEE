Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a similar risk as you with inflation, so I think we should split it more evenly.  Let's get this done before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000
