"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, let's see if we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $2,000 is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is $1,800. Bob's gain of $8,000 is now worth 95% of the original amount, which is $7,600.

I'm not too thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain will be worth 81% of the original amount, which is $8,100. I'll aim for a slightly more balanced split this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's see if we can make a deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still hoping to get a better deal, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain of $3,000 is worth 70.9% of the original amount, which is $2,073. My gain is now worth 34.2% of the original $10,000.

Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 85.74% of the original amount, which is $8,529.80.

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
