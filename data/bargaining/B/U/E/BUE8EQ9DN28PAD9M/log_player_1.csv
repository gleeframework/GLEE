"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take 400k and let's end it here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering I'm taking the risk of this round's inflation. Let's finish this! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll be gaining $320,000 (20% less than $400,000). Bob's gain of $600,000 is still worth the same as in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, especially since I'll be losing value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value for me (20% less than the previous round), so I'll be gaining $256,000 (20% less than $320,000). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger risk with each round. I'll give you 300k, but I'm taking the lion's share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's call it even. 50/50 split. We're both taking a risk with this inflation, so let's just end it here. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 51.2% of its original value for me (48.8% less than the original amount), so I'll be gaining $512,000 (20% less than $640,000, but then 20% less than that, and then another 20% less than that, and so on, which is roughly 51.2% of the original amount). 

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially since I've been trying to negotiate for a better deal. However, I'm also not sure if I want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less.
