  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Given that the money is worth significantly less, I'll accept this offer to get some money rather than risking further erosion of value.
