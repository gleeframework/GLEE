"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll have to be careful with this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

Let's see... if I accept this offer, I'll get 400,000 dollars, which is worth 90% of the original 600,000 dollars from my previous offer. That's a loss for me.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for my next move!

Since the money is worth 20% of its original value now (90% of 90% of 90%...), I'll aim for a higher percentage to make up for the losses.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
