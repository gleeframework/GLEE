"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, where I get 70 dollars and Bob gets 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. The money is worth less, but I'm still willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I get 45 dollars and Bob gets 55 dollars."
