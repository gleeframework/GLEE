"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, Alice! I'm offering you a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, I'm not getting a great deal, but it's better than the 10% loss I'd take by rejecting and going to the next round. I'll accept the offer.

```
