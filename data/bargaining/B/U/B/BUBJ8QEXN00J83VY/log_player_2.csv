Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a serious compromise here. This is practically a 50/50 split considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now very close to an even split.  Given the time pressure and the fact that Alice is feeling the impact of inflation more acutely, accepting this offer guarantees Bob a significant sum. Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds carries the risk of getting nothing at all if an agreement isn't reached."
