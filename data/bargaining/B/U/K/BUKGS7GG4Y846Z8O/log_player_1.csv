"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and can move on to the next round."

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can get away with a slightly better deal, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive this time, but still keeping it reasonable."

Round 4

# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be more generous, but I'm not sure if he's being sincere.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Hmm... 75 for me is a pretty good offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll take a chance and...
