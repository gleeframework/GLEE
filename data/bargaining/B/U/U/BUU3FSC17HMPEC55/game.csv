600000.0,400000.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer.  60/40 seems reasonable to me, considering the inflation factor.  What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a more equitable split.  How about 55/45 in my favor?  Remember, the inflation affects you more than me.  Let's work together to make the most of this opportunity.",Bob,2,

560000.0,440000.0,"Bob, I understand your point, but I also have to look out for myself with this inflation.  How about we meet closer to the middle with 56/44?",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here. With the inflation hitting you harder, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but 52.5/47.5 is the most I can offer.  Let's make a deal before the inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Bob,4,

540000.0,460000.0,"Bob, we're getting close to a deal, but we need to find a middle ground. 54/46 seems fair considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close this out.",Alice,5,

490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to go a little lower on my end, but 51/49 is my final offer.  It's the best way to ensure we both get something before the inflation makes this deal worthless.",Bob,6,
