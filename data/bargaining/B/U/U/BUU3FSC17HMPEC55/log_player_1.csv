Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to go a little lower on my end, but 51/49 is my final offer.  It's the best way to ensure we both get something before the inflation makes this deal worthless.

This is a tough one! While not ideal, accepting ensures I get something before the inflation significantly eats into the potential gains.  Bob is clearly playing hardball, but waiting any longer is too risky."
