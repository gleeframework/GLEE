I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share early on.  If not, I can adjust my offer in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is better for me than getting nothing, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to try to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split this round. This takes into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement before the money dwindles further."
