"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think 60-40 is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering I'll be the one making the next offer if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 65-35 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the money, I'll accept this offer for now.
