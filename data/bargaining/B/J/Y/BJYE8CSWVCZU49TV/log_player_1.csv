"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob gets the remaining 10%, which is $100,000. My message to Bob is a simple one - I think we should split it fairly, and I'm willing to take the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get a tiny share, but it's better than nothing! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

After calculating the new values due to inflation, I see that the total amount is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's $950,000 in total.

My gain would be 5.25% of the new total, which is $49,750.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, it's a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $950,000 (after the first two rounds), which is $665,000, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $284,500. My message to Bob is that we should meet in the middle and split it fairly."
