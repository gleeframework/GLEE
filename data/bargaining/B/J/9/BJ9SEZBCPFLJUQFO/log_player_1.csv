"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get as much money as possible in the first round, but I'm also aware of the inflation risk. I'm offering Bob a small amount to encourage him to accept, but I'm keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is already affecting the value of the money I'm getting. It's better to accept this offer and get at least something rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
