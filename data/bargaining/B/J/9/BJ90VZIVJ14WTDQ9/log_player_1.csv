"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to seal the deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for Bob to consider accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is in order.  Let's both get closer to 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. The 50/50 split is a good middle ground, and I'm okay with taking $450,000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
