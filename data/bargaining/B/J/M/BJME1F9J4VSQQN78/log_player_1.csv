Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since this is the first round, I'm taking the lion's share. But, keep in mind that with each passing round, the money will be worth less to me!  Let's see what you think, Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to affect the value of the money significantly. Accepting this 50/50 split is the best course of action to maximize my gains."
