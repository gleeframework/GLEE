Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but still not quite there 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming increasingly significant. Accepting Alice's offer in round 5, even though it favors her, is better than risking further losses in subsequent rounds. 

It's a tough choice, but the longer the game goes on, the more the odds are stacked against Bob due to the inflation mechanic."
