"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, and keeping 60 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this case, I'd be getting 45 dollars, which is equivalent to 56.25 dollars in the original value (45 / 0.8).

Bob would be getting 55 dollars, which is equivalent to 57.5 dollars in the original value (55 / 0.95).

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this is a decent offer. I'll accept Bob's proposal.
