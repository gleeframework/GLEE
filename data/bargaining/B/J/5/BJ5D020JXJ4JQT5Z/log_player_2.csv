Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You want to split the difference? I'll take a bit more instead 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While the difference between her offer and my last proposal is narrowing, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount of the potential gain, even considering the inflation. It's time to play hardball."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Accept it, or the deal is off the table.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Resolve:** By stating this is my final offer, I project seriousness and a limit to how far I'll bend to inflation.
* **Slight Shift in Power:**  Alice's offers have been creeping up slightly.  By sticking to a number close to my previous, I'm signaling I won't be easily swayed.
* **Clear Stakes:** By stating ""the deal is off the table,"" I introduce a consequence to endless stalling, which could hurt Alice too.

This is a risky strategy, but given Alice's aggressive approach, a firm stance might be the only way to secure a decent share of the diminishing returns."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer? I don't think so 
# Bob gain: 405000 
# Alice gain: 595000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly calling my bluff and demonstrating she's willing to play this game to the wire. My negotiating position has significantly weakened:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The 26.49% inflation means I'm losing a substantial chunk of potential earnings with every passing round.
* **Alice's Resolve:** Her message indicates she's not afraid to push this further, even if it means both losing out to some extent.

While this offer is far from ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get. Accepting now cuts my losses and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if Alice refuses to budge."
