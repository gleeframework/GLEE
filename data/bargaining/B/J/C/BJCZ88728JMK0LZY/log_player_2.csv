I'm going to try to get more money. I know Alice is losing value on her money faster than me, so I'll see if I can leverage that."

Alice is still offering me less than what I proposed in the previous round, and the inflation is hurting her more. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

While I'd love to get more, I'm losing value on my money very quickly. This offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, but it's better than nothing at this point."
