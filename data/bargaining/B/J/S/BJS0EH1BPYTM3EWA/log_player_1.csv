"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40%. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 50/50 split, huh? That's a bold move!

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to give up my negotiating power just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to regain some ground, but still keeping it relatively balanced. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at our potential gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially with the value of the money decreasing so rapidly. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more aggressive. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money and get a better deal for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! With the money being worth so much less, I'll have to think carefully about Bob's new offer. Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm willing to accept a 30/70 split, given the circumstances. It's not ideal, but I'd rather take what I can get and move on."
