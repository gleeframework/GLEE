"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer is a bit aggressive, but I believe it's a good starting point. I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to incentivize him to accept. Since it's the first round, the inflation factor won't be significant yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal. Even with the 5% inflation, it's not a fair deal. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll need a better offer. I'm confident I can get a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've increased Bob's gain to make it more appealing. This is a good compromise considering the inflation factor and the fact that I rejected his previous offer. Hopefully, this offer will be more enticing for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than before. Inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided deal.  I'll counter with a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm taking a more moderate approach this time. The inflation is becoming a serious concern, but I need to balance that with the fact that Bob seems unwilling to negotiate. By offering a 75/25 split, I'm showing I'm willing to compromise while still securing a majority of the remaining value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed that Bob's offer is still quite low, the inflation is becoming increasingly impactful. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point, as it ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing.  The longer we negotiate, the less the money will be worth for me."
