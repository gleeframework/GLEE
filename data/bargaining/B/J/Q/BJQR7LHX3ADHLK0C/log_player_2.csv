Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a slightly better split this time. Let's settle this quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, accepting now would still give Alice a significantly larger share. It's worth risking another round to see if I can secure a better deal, even with inflation eating into my potential gains."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""This is a very fair offer, Alice. Let's avoid the inflation and wrap this up.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, banking on my fear of inflation to force me into accepting a bad deal. However, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold firm and show I'm willing to risk further inflation to get a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, Alice. I'm taking a smaller share to settle this fairly before inflation hurts us both more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, you're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is right, time is running out and inflation is eating into my potential gains. However, her offer is still far from fair. I need to hold my ground for another round or two. The threat of getting nothing at all might push Alice to be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's end this now.  Take the slightly larger share and we can both walk away with something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing nearly half the value, give up soon 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking losing even more to inflation in the coming rounds. Accepting a smaller share now is better than potentially ending up with nothing if Alice continues to play hardball."
