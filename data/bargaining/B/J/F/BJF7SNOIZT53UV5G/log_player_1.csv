Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take the risk. This is my new proposal. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting less than I initially hoped, the inflation is making each round more risky for me. It's better to take what I can get than risk getting even less in the next round."
