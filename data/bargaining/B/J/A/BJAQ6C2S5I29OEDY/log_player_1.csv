"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more, huh?

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, it's now worth 95% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55% and leaving 45% for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting any younger too! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be funny.

However, let's get down to business. With inflation, the money is worth less and less, so I need to make the most of it.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. 480,000 is better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value."
