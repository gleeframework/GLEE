"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

 I propose to keep $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  This gives me a larger share, but it's a fair starting point to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. Even with the inflation,  Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing to take $700,000 and give Bob $300,000.  This is a compromise from my first offer, but still more favorable to me than Bob's offer in the previous round. Let's see if we can agree on a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still not thrilled with the offer, my potential gains are significantly diminished with the continued inflation.  It's better to accept and secure a share than risk getting nothing at all in future rounds."
