"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the value we each bring. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better deal. It's only Round 1, and I'm not afraid of a little inflation. Bring on Round 2!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think I bring more value to the table. How about we try this split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money arguing.  This is my final offer, let's close the deal and get our share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think it's time to accept the offer. The inflation is starting to take its toll, and I don't think I can get a better deal than this. Alice seems firm, and I don't want to risk losing more value. Let's close the deal!"
