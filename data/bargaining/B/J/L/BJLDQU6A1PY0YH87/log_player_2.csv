"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, let's split this fairly!  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, it's heavily skewed in her favor.  Since there are 12 rounds, and each round reduces the value of the money by 10%, I can do much better than this initial offer.  I'll reject and see what Alice counters with."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us.""}
