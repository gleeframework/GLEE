"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original amount, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Let's split it more evenly this time.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the uneven split this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and tries to get a better deal for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to compromise. This is a fairer split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, considering the inflation."
