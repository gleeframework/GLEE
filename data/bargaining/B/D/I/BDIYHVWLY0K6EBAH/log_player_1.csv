Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stick with the even split. I'm not sure why you keep offering less, but I'm willing to keep negotiating fairly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation. While he sees this as an even split, the decreasing value of the money over time means he's getting a better and better deal each round, while my potential gains remain static. I need to incentivize him to accept a less favorable deal sooner rather than later."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money in this game.  I'm increasing my offer slightly again, but we need to reach an agreement soon.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased urgency:**  Bob needs to understand that time is not on his side.  The longer this goes on, the less favorable an even split becomes for him.
* **Small concessions:**  I'm still aiming for a deal that benefits me more, but I'm willing to make small concessions to show flexibility and encourage Bob to settle. 
* **Avoiding extreme demands:** A significant jump in my favor might make Bob dig in his heels. A smaller increase maintains the pressure while keeping the negotiation open."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I still think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. We are both losing value with each round, and I don't see why you keep offering less. Let's reach a compromise before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is finally acknowledging the diminishing value, but he's still not internalizing it.  He's framing it as both of us losing equally, which isn't true. His 50% is worth significantly less each round. I need to hold firm and make him realize a deal sooner, even if slightly worse for him, is better than an ""even"" split later."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm going back to my original offer. We're running out of time, and this is the fairest deal considering the circumstances. Let's be reasonable and end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, the urgency is palpable.  Bob needs to understand we're approaching a lose-lose scenario.
* **Return to fairness:**  Framing my original offer as the ""fairest"" option highlights that *his* perception of fairness isn't accounting for the changing value.
* **Finality:**  This isn't a threat, but a clear signal that my concessions are limited.  It's time for Bob to make a decision: accept a reasonable deal now or risk everything for an increasingly worse outcome later."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my original proposal of a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option considering the inflation. Let's end this game before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but the risk is too high now.  Here's why:

* **Significant devaluation:** Bob's 50% is now worth less than half its original value.  While accepting means I'm not getting my ideal split, it's far better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds.
* **Bob's stubbornness:**  He's fixated on ""fairness"" without acknowledging the shifting reality.  It's unlikely he'll suddenly change his approach in the remaining rounds.
* **Limited time:**  We're down to the wire. Holding out for a slightly better deal carries the huge risk of both of us walking away with nothing.

It's painful to concede, but in this scenario, securing something is better than risking everything on Bob's flawed understanding of the situation."
