"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and leaving $40 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's up to Bob to decide if he wants to accept or propose a different split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my gain accordingly.

For Round 2, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually $45 in ""real"" money.

Bob's gain of $50 is worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually $47.50 in ""real"" money.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather not give you a 50/50 split, especially since it's slightly skewed in your favor due to inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

For Round 3, my gain of $60 is worth 81% of its original value, so it's actually $48.60 in ""real"" money.
Bob's gain of $40 is worth 90.25% of its original value, so it's actually $36.10 in ""real"" money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values in ""real"" money:

My gain of $48 is worth 27.1% of its original value, so it's actually $13.35 in ""real"" money.
Bob's gain of $52 is worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's actually $85.74 in ""real"" money.

Considering the significant difference in the actual values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""It's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to another round.""
}
```"
