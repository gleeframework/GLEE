I propose taking 900,000 dollars for myself and leaving 100,000 for Bob. I want to start by being generous, but still secure a large share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm getting 200,000, it's still significantly less than my initial proposal, and I can still get a better deal later. Let's see what Bob offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer for Bob slightly to 200,000. I hope this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, as I'm still getting a majority of the money."
