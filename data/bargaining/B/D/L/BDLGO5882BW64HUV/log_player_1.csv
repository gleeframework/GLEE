Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. I want to maximize my share while still having a chance to win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, and while the inflation hurts, it's still better to reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  I can make a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, taking into account the inflation but still aiming for a larger share. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
