Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. We both get a decent amount, and we avoid the risk of further inflation.  Let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 4

""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to a fair split.  This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation we're facing.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to the end. Let's be practical. You get a significant portion, and I get the majority. It's the best outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this offer is significantly lower than what I'd like, we're getting into dangerous territory. However, Alice's offers are getting progressively better for me, and I think she's starting to understand the pressure of the inflation. I'll hold out a bit longer to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and the value is shrinking.  Let's end this now with a deal that is fair for both of us.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're approaching the end. This is my final offer.  It's time to be realistic and secure what we can before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a terrible offer, but I have no choice left. If I reject this, Alice will likely offer me even less next round, and the inflation will continue to eat away at my potential gains. Taking the $100,000 is the only way to guarantee I get something out of this."
