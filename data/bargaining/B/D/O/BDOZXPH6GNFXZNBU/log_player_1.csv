"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round, my gain in this round would be 0.95 x 700,000 = 665,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept a 50/50 split, as it doesn't account for the fact that I made the first offer. I'd like to make another proposal to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less after the second round, my gain in this round would be 0.95 x 665,000 = 629,250.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I'm trying to find a balance between a fair split and a compromise."
