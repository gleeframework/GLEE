"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'm keeping the remaining 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest. Let's end this early and avoid any potential complications from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $80 in the first round is now worth $76.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $80 in the first round is now worth $76, and it's worth even less in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, but I'm not going any lower.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the remaining $100, which is $40. I'm keeping the remaining 60% for myself, which is $60."
