"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $5,000 is worth 90% of $6,000, which is $5,400, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of $4,000, which is $3,200.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
