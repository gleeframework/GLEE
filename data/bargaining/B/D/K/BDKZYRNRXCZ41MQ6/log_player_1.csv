"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20$ and keeping 80$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my calculations considering the inflation.

Let's see... if the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 70$ is actually equivalent to 70 / 0.8 = 87.5$ in the first round. And Bob's gain of 30$ is equivalent to 30 / 0.95 = 31.58$ in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to be more reasonable.

Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 60$ is actually equivalent to 75$ in the first round. And Bob's gain of 40$ is equivalent to 42.11$ in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 55/45""
}
```"
