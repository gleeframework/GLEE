"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40.  It's a fair starting point for us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm feeling a bit greedy. 60/40 is a decent starting point, but I think I can do better. Let's see what Alice comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still going to need the majority. Let's get this deal done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it's not reasonable given the inflation.  I need to secure my share. Let's do 65/35. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is willing to meet me halfway. While it's not ideal, I'd rather take the 35% now than risk getting nothing at all later.  Inflation is a real concern, and it's better to secure something than to gamble and potentially lose everything."
