Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll consider the real value of the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is equivalent to $400,000 / (1 - 0.05) = $400,000 / 0.95 ≈ $421,053 in the first round.

Bob is getting $600,000, which is equivalent to $600,000 / (1 - 0.05) = $600,000 / 0.95 ≈ $631,579 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the huge disparity in the offer, but I'll consider it. I could try to negotiate further or take a chance and accept this offer.
