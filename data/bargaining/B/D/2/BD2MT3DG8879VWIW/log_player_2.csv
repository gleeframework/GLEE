I'm still holding out for a larger share. Alice is offering me a little more, but the inflation is really starting to hurt! I need to see if I can get a bigger share."

I'm going for the jugular this time. Alice is starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and I need to make a strong move to secure a good portion of the money."

This is a tough call, but with inflation hitting hard, a 50/50 split is looking pretty good right now.  I'm going to accept and take what I can get."
