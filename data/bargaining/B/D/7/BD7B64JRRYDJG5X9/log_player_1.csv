"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share while still securing a majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is less than what I proposed in the first round, accepting this offer is still better than continuing and risking a further reduction in value due to inflation."
