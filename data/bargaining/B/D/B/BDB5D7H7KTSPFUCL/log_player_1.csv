"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering we don't know what the future holds and the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. Since the money is worth less now, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share initially to leave room for potential growth in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and offer 55/45, a slight advantage for me, but still a reasonable split""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a slightly more favorable ratio for me, but still a reasonable compromise considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and offer 55/45, a slight advantage for me, but still a reasonable split 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a 55/45 split, which is actually a better deal for me than my original proposal in Round 3. The effects of inflation have made the money worth less, so I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to get the game over with."
