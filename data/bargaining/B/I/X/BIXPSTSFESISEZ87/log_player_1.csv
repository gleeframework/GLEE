"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 600,000. The money is worth 20% less now, so I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping a slight edge, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a sweet spot, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. 550,000 is a decent share, considering the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'm hoping to get a good deal while I still can."
