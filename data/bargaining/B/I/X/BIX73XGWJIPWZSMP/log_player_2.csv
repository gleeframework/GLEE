Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The even split is tempting, but I'm willing to take a chance and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to take a bit more than half, since Alice was willing to give me 50% initially. Let's see how she reacts.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I want a bit more than half, but still a relatively fair split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go back to an even split.  Inflation is hurting us both, and we need to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Alice is still offering an even split and inflation is starting to take its toll, I think it's wise to accept this offer. We both lose if we don't come to an agreement soon.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take the even split to ensure we both get something before the value drops further."
