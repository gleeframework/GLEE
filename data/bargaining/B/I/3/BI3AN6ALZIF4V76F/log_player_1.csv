"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started and see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous round. I'd like to see if Bob is willing to offer a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again!

Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll make a new proposal that takes that into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to be too generous!""
}
```

I'm offering a 58/42 split, which is a slightly more favorable deal for Bob, but still not a 50/50 split. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to his advantage!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. The 75/25 split is not acceptable to me, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous round. I'd like to see if Bob is willing to offer a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again!

Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll make a new proposal that takes that into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but don't expect any more!""
}
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split, which is a slightly more favorable deal for Bob, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if he'll accept!"
