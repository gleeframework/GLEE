"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money 55/45. Since the value decreases more for you, I think this is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. I'm offering you 42 dollars. This is a better deal than you'll get if you keep pushing it.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the value is decreasing more for you, I think 58/42 is a reasonable split. You should accept before it's worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to take advantage of my diminishing returns. While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, accepting now would still give Bob the majority of the money. I need to hold out for a better deal and hope Bob understands the time pressure as well."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 57,
""bob_gain"": 43,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time.  This offer still gives you a good share, and we both lose if this goes any further.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant decrease in value for you, I'm willing to take a larger share. This is still a better deal for you than losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. Bob is unlikely to offer anything better at this point."
