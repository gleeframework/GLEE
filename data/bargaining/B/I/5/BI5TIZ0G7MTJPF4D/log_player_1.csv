"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than before, but I'm not going to be generous. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $580,000 is worth 20% less than my original proposal, which is $600,000, so it's a bit of a decrease. However, Bob's gain of $420,000 is worth 5% less than his original proposal, which is $441,000, so it's a small decrease.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you less, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to $700,000, which is a significant increase from my original proposal, and offering Bob $300,000, which is a decrease from his original proposal. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I want a bigger share to account for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 670000 
# Bob gain: 330000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $670,000 is worth 48.8% less than my original proposal of $1,200,000 ($600,000 in round 1 + 20% decrease in round 2 + 20% decrease in round 3), which is a significant decrease.

Bob's gain of $330,000 is worth 14.26% less than his original proposal of $385,000 ($420,000 in round 2 + 5% decrease in round 3), which is a relatively small decrease.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping for a better deal, considering the significant decrease in value of my gain due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a very small share, but I'm not willing to give up more than this.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offers, and offering Bob a very small share of $100,000. I'm hoping that this will be the final offer and that Bob will accept it."
