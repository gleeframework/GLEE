Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems fair, as I'm the one making the first offer and I have to deal with the initial 20% inflation hit.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best choice.  Inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and if I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.  This offer at least secures me a substantial sum, even with the inflation."
