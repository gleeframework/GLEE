# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it close, and I'm losing a significant chunk to inflation. However, Alice seems firm, and getting nothing is a terrible outcome. It's better to secure something now than risk losing it all."
