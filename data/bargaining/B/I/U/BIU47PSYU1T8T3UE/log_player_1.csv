"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too one-sided, I'd like a better deal""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 70% of the remaining 100$ (which is now worth less for Bob due to inflation). I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share, but still a fair split. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite aggressive now! With the money worth 27.1% less for Bob due to inflation, I'm not sure I want to give him such a large share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too one-sided, I'm not willing to give you 75%""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with giving Bob 75% of the remaining 100$ (which is worth even less for him due to inflation). I'll try to make another offer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, no more negotiations""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, offering a 50-50 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally settle the game."
