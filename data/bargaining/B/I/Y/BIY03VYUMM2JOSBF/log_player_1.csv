"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a split of 90 for me and 10 for Bob. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the risk of being rejected and having to wait for Bob's counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation effect. His 95 is worth less than my 90 in the first round.  I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 75 for me and 25 for Bob. This accounts for the inflation while still giving Bob a fair chance to get a decent share."
