I propose to take $990,000 and leave $10,000 for Bob. This is a fair offer, considering the risks involved."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm reducing my share to $900,000 and increasing Bob's share to $100,000. This is a compromise to show my willingness to negotiate, while still securing a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still a bad deal for me. I'd rather keep playing and see if I can negotiate a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

I'm increasing Bob's share to $190,000, hoping to reach a compromise. We both need to be more flexible to avoid getting nothing."
