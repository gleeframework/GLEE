"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's split the money!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we should accept this offer and split the money now!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! Take this offer and let's move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, trying to be a bit more generous this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair split, no more games! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a fair split now.

Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll receive:

* My gain: 500,000 / 0.727 (since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9% of the original value) = approximately 687,000
* Bob's gain: 500,000 / 0.5192 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value) = approximately 965,000

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
