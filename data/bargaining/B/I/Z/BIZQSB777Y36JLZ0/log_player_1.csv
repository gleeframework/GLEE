"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nHow's that? I'm offering Bob a decent chunk of the money, but I'm also making sure I get a bigger share since I'm making the first offer. The message is friendly to try to persuade Bob to accept. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round, he has an incentive to settle sooner rather than later. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Don't let inflation eat away your share!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer, taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round. I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept this offer before the value of his potential gain decreases further. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice! This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering Bob's message that this is his last offer, and taking into account that the money is still worth the same to me, I think this is a reasonable deal. I've managed to negotiate a better share than Bob's initial offer, and I don't want to risk Bob walking away or making an even lower offer if I reject this one. I'll accept this offer and settle for $550,000."
