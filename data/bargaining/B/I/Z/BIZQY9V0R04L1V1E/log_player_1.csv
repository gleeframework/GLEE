I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm hoping to get a good start in this game, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Let's try a 50/50 split this time. It's fair and avoids the risk of further inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though it's less than I initially wanted, it's still a decent deal.  I'm not sure I can get a better offer in the next round, considering the inflation.  I'll take it!"
