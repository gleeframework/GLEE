"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  This protects both of us from further inflation losses while still acknowledging the difference in our rates. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
