I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm willing to compromise and offer Bob a larger share this time.  I'll take $600,000 and Bob can have $400,000."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 700000

I'm still not happy with that division.  I'm willing to wait and see what happens in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm raising my offer again, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'll take $700,000 this time, and Bob can have $300,000.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Bob gain: 600000

This offer is getting closer to what I feel is fair, and inflation is really biting into my potential gains. I'll accept this offer."
