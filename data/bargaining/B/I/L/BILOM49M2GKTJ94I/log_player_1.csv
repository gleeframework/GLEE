"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. My reasoning is that since the money is worth less with each passing round, especially for Bob, it's better to come to an agreement early. This way, we both get a decent share before the value drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation affects us differently. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This one is more realistic.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $5,800 and leave $4,200 for Bob. Given that the money is worth even less now, especially for Bob, I believe this offer is a reasonable compromise. I'm still open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to consider the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's important we settle this before inflation eats further into our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
