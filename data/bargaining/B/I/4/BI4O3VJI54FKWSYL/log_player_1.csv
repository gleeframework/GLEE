"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $750,000 and Bob gets $250,000. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair and balanced split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the new values are:

* Alice's gain: $675,000 (=$750,000 x 0.9)
* Bob's gain: $495,000 (=$550,000 x 0.9)

I'm not convinced that this is a fair and balanced split, especially since the money is worth less now. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in Round 3. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so the new values are:

* Alice's gain: $627,750 (=$675,000 x 0.925)
* Bob's gain: $455,625 (=$495,000 x 0.925)

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
