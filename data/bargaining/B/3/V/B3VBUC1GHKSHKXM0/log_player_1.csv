"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 5% less this round, so I'd be getting $57.50 (60 - 5% of 60). Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'd be getting $45 (40 - 10% of 40).

I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle, since I'd be giving up $2.50 to do so. I'd like to try to negotiate further.
