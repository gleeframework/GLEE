Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice.  This is a much fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. A 50/50 split is the fairest option for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, a 50/50 split it is.  Let's just end this before we both lose out more."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation is severely impacting my gains. Every round makes a significant difference.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixated on the 50/50 split. It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing means risking getting even less in later rounds. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount."
