This is a tough one! Here's why I made the decision to accept:

* **Severe Inflation:**  We're at round 6, meaning my potential gains are down over 40%!  Waiting any longer is disastrous.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share.  It's unlikely he'll suddenly offer something much better.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  If I reject this, there's a chance we reach a point where even a 50/50 split is worse due to inflation eating my share. 

While 300,000 is much less than I aimed for, it's the most logical choice given the circumstances."
