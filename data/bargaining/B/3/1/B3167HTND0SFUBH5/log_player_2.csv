Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a dangerous game, assuming I'll crack under the pressure of inflation. While the value is decreasing, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than half is not a winning strategy. I need to show firmness and push for a more equitable split in the coming rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. The clock is ticking - for both of us!""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me!  While this isn't a great deal, it's better than walking away with nothing if Alice continues to lowball me in the remaining rounds."
