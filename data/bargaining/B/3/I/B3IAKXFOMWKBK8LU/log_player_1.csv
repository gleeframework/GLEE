"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 80/20 split in my favor. While the money is losing value, I believe this is a fairer split considering the risks of continued negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
