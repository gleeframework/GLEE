"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up too much. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $500,000, but it's worth less due to inflation. Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually worth more to me than it was in the first round.

I'll accept this offer.
