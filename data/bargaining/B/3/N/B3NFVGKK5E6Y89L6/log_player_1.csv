"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:**  Alice starts with a respectable offer that leans in her favor. This establishes her position without being overly aggressive.
* **Time Value of Money:** Alice is aware that the money loses value more rapidly for her (10% per round) compared to Bob (5% per round).  A slightly favorable offer now is better than a potentially more favorable offer later when the money is worth less.
* **Encouraging Collaboration:** The message aims to set a collaborative tone.  Phrases like ""let's be fair"" and ""ensures we both benefit""  might make Bob more receptive to accepting a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more equitable, considering the future inflation rates.  Let's end this on a fair note. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor. While he acknowledges the inflation rates, he's using it as leverage to secure a much larger share. Accepting this offer would leave Alice with significantly less, even accounting for the reduced value over time. It's strategically better to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. My last offer was generous. This is a compromise to get this done.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Value Decreases:**  Both Alice and Bob are losing money with each passing round due to the inflation mechanic. Alice needs to act fast.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** Alice is moving closer to a 50/50 split, but still maintaining a slight advantage. This shows a willingness to negotiate while not completely caving to Bob's demands.
* **Assertive Messaging:** The message adopts a firmer tone.  Alice is signaling that she's serious about reaching a deal but won't accept an unfair split. The phrase ""realistic"" emphasizes that time is working against them both."
