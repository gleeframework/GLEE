I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to give Bob something to hopefully get the deal done quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a decent deal. With the inflation factor, I'm essentially getting 400,000 (80% of my initial 500,000) in the first round. It's better than risking getting nothing by rejecting and going through more rounds."
