"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer to try to get him to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer. My gain of $400,000 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value. I'll accept his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
