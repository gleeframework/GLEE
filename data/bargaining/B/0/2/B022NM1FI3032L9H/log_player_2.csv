Round 5

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting a 44/56 split now is better than potentially getting a slightly better deal later when the money is worth even less. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly.  
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice started by offering a 40/60 split and has gradually moved closer to the middle ground. It's unlikely she'll concede much more. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes taking a decent deal is better than risking it all for a slightly better outcome."
