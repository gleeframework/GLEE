"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll get a bit more since I'm the first to propose.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's split it 6:4 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 80% of the original 4000, which is 3200.

I'm not too thrilled about the 6:4 split, but I'll accept this offer to move on to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
