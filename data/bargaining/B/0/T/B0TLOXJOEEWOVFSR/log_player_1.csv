"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose to take 990,000 and give Bob 10,000.  It's a fair starting point, and since the money depreciates for me each round, it's in my best interest to get this settled quickly.  Let's see if Bob is willing to take such a small slice of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 500,000 is a significant amount, it's still a far cry from the 990,000 I was initially aiming for.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since the money depreciates for me with each passing round. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm willing to reduce my share a bit more, but I still want the majority of the money.  Since the money depreciates for me, it's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.  900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob seems like a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, even though he's getting more money each round.  I'm still holding out for a bigger share.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate something better.  The longer we wait, the more the money depreciates for me, but I'm confident I can still get a decent deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm getting impatient with Bob's intransigence.  I'm willing to drop to 800,000, but I'm not going any lower.  I need to secure a good deal quickly to minimize the impact of inflation.  Hopefully, this offer will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting bolder with each round, and his offers are becoming increasingly unfavorable. While the money depreciates, I still have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for such a small share. I'll reject this offer and see if I can sway him with a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still hoping to get a good deal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the depreciating value of the money. This offer is a significant reduction from my previous ones, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob that I'm serious about securing a deal.  If he rejects this, I'm not sure what I'll do in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and his offers are becoming less and less appealing. While I'm feeling the pressure of the depreciating value of the money, I'm still not ready to settle for such a small share. I'll reject this offer and hope that in the next round, he'll realize he needs to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm running out of time and the money keeps depreciating, but I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with less than 600,000.  This is my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to walk away and get nothing rather than accept a deal that is so unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting. He's taking almost everything while leaving me with a pittance. Despite the depreciating value of the money, I'm not going to be bullied into accepting such an unfair deal. I'll reject this offer and hope that in the remaining rounds, he'll come to his senses and offer something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm at the end of my rope. The money is depreciating rapidly, and I'm losing so much with each passing round. This offer is a 50/50 split, the fairest we can achieve at this point.  It's better than nothing, and I'm willing to compromise to save at least some of what's left."
