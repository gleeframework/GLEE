"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90, you take 10.  We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this is a fair offer in the first round, I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer. We can both benefit from this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 65/35 is a better starting point.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I still think a 60/40 split is fairer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a deal where I get less than 40%."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. 50/50 is a fair and equitable solution. No more arguing, let's just get this done.""}
```"
