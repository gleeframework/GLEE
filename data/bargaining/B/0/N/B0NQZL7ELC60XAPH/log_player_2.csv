Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think 50/50 is a fair split. Let's not waste any more time on this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nA 50/50 split seems fair, and considering the inflation, it's better to settle now rather than risk losing more value."
