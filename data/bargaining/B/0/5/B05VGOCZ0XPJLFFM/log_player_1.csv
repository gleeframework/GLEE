"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a bit more fair, considering the work I'm putting in to make these decisions! ðŸ˜‰ 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3800. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $4800.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, considering the original amount is still the same""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90.25% of its original value (95% * 95% = 90.25%), so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 42/58 is a more reasonable split""
}
```"
