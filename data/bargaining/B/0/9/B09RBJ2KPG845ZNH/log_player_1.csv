"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I propose taking 990,000 for myself and giving Bob 10,000.  Since I'm the one making the proposal, I'm assuming Bob will prefer to get something than nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred my original proposal, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of my gains. It's better to accept this offer and secure a sizable portion of the money than risk getting nothing at all."
