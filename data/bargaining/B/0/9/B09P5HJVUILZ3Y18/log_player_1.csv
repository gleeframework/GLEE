"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing to divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to make a move! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a better deal for myself given the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
