{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to be greedy and try to get the most I can in the first round, but leave Bob with enough to make him think there's a chance of getting more in the next round if he rejects.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive, but I still think I can do better than 600,000.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in so easily!  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway, but still aim for a larger share.  It's a risk, but I think I can get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting ridiculous. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to try and get a bit closer to what Bob offered in the last round.  I'm losing a lot of value from the inflation, so I need to be careful not to get too greedy.  However, I'm not going to give up on getting a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really pushing his luck here! He's essentially trying to take 70% of the money, while I'm losing more and more each round.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round, but I'm starting to feel the pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

This is a tough one. I'm losing so much value with each round. Bob is being very stubborn, but I think I can still get him to agree on a slightly better split for me.  I'm going to offer 400k to myself and 600k to Bob. This might be close enough for him to take it, considering the pressure of the dwindling time and his own share remaining constant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting even more greedy.  He's basically trying to take 80% of the money while I'm losing over half of what I could have gotten in the first round!  I'm starting to feel desperate, but I'm not going to give in yet. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a bit more than his last offer to try and get him to agree.  The inflation is really hurting me now, so I have to accept a smaller share to avoid getting nothing at all. I'm hoping he sees the value in getting at least something and not risking a complete loss in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting absurd. Bob is basically trying to take 90% of the money while I'm losing almost two-thirds of what I could have gotten! It's frustrating, but I'm not going to give in so easily. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, even with the remaining time pressure. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000}
```

This is my last chance to get anything at all.  The inflation is killing me, and Bob is clearly trying to exploit it. I'm offering him a larger share than my last counteroffer, hoping he'll see that it's better to take what he can get now than to risk getting nothing at all in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a heartbreaking offer, but I have no other choice.  I'm losing so much value due to inflation that accepting this tiny sliver is better than getting nothing at all.  It's a bitter end to this game, but I have to concede defeat."
