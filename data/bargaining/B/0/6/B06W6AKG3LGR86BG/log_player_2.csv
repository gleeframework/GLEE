"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60, you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for the division of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, Alice. Considering the inflation, I think this offer is reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll consider the effects of inflation and accept this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hurting us both, Bob. I need to get a bit more this round to make it worthwhile. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation, I think this offer is reasonable. The longer we drag this out, the less the money will be worth for both of us. I'm willing to accept this offer to minimize further losses."
