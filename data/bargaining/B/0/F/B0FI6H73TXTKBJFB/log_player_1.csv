"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't fool me, I know you want more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's clever, doesn't he?

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I don't think it's fair. He's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the 10% inflation, and I'm trying to meet Bob in the middle with a slight advantage for myself. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm desperate, does he?

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still not fair. The inflation has taken a bigger bite out of my potential gain, and I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split. I'll keep waiting for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm still reasonable, Bob. Meet me in the middle again!""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to account for the increased inflation, and I'm still trying to meet Bob in the middle. I'm hoping he'll see reason and accept this offer!"
