"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and we can discuss any adjustments from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's fair, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, as I was hoping for a slightly more favorable split for myself. I'm willing to consider a 55-45 split, but 50-50 feels a bit too even for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on the split, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my initial offer. This 55-45 split is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting 5,500 and Bob getting 4,500. I'm hoping this revised offer is more acceptable to Bob."
