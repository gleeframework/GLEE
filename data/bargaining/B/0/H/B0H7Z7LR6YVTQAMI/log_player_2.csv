"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers in the next round.  I'd like to see if she'll budge from her initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split. It's fair, and we both get a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise on the split, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my initial offer. This 55-45 split is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is a factor.  Getting 4500 is better than risking getting nothing later on."
