"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer from round 2.
