"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 270,000. Bob's gain of 700,000 is worth 630,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
