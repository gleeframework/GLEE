I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I'll take $9,000, leaving Bob with $1,000. I think it's a good starting point, considering the inflation factor. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair. I'm not going to accept that.  It's my turn to make an offer next, and I'll try to find a more equitable solution."

Round 3

I'm still aiming for a good deal, but I'm willing to compromise a little.  I'll offer Bob $1,500 this time, hoping we can reach an agreement before the inflation really kicks in."

Bob's offer is still too one-sided. I'm not going to accept it. I'll make another offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to lower my offer a bit more to try and reach a compromise. I'll offer Bob $2,000 this time, hoping he'll see that we're both losing money with each passing round."

Bob's offer is still too high for me.  I'm starting to think this might be a losing game for both of us."

Round 7

I'm taking a big risk here, but I need to try and find a middle ground. I'm offering Bob $2,500. We're running out of time, and I'm afraid both of us will lose if we keep rejecting each other's offers."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too high for me. I'm starting to feel like we're both going to end up with nothing.  But I'm not going to accept an unfair offer.  We'll see what happens in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

We're getting dangerously close to the end, and the inflation is really hurting. I'm willing to give Bob a larger share this time, hoping we can finally reach an agreement. I'm offering him $3,000, which should be a good deal considering the current inflation rate."
