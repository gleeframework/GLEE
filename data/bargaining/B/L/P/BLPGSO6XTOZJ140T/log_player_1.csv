"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000. Since this is the first round, the inflation hasn't affected the money yet. I'm starting with a high offer to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, even with the inflation factor. I'm going to reject this offer and hope that in the next round I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing to take $6,000 and leave Bob with $4,000.  This is still a significant amount for me, even after the 20% inflation from the previous round. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise, given his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I proposed in the first round.  I'm going to reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Given that Bob rejected my previous offer and that inflation is a significant factor, I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances and ensures we both receive a substantial portion of the money, even after the loss due to inflation."
