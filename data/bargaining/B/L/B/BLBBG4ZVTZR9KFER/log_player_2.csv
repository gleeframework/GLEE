Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

This is a tough one, but I'm leaning towards accepting. Here's why:

* **Inflation is hurting:** The longer the game goes on, the less my share is actually worth.  
* **Alice is unlikely to budge much:** She's consistently offered splits where she gets the lion's share. It's unlikely she'll suddenly offer a much better deal in later rounds.
* **Something is better than nothing:** If I reject this, there's a chance we might not reach an agreement, and I'll end up with nothing. 

While 42 is significantly less than what I'd like, the impact of inflation makes this the least risky option at this point."
