Let's see what I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5100,
  ""alice_gain"": 4900,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the offer.  Even though I'm getting less than I offered in round 2, inflation is hitting me harder and I don't want to risk getting even less in a later round."
