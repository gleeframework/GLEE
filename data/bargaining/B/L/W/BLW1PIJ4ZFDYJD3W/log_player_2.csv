"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'll take 90% of the money, and you can have the remaining 10%.  This is a fair offer, as I'm taking the risk of rejection and the next round's inflation will only further incentivize me to take a larger share. Let's end this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money in a 3:2 ratio. I'll take 600000 and you'll receive 400000. This keeps the division relatively balanced while considering the risk of further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
