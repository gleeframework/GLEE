750000.0,250000.0,Let's divide the money with a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 750000 and you'll get 250000.,Alice,1,

100000.0,900000.0,"I'll take 90% of the money, and you can have the remaining 10%.  This is a fair offer, as I'm taking the risk of rejection and the next round's inflation will only further incentivize me to take a larger share. Let's end this now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I propose we split the money in a 3:2 ratio. I'll take 600000 and you'll receive 400000. This keeps the division relatively balanced while considering the risk of further inflation.,Alice,3,
