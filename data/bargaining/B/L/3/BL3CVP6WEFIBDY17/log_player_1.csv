"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100 and leave 30% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more balanced split.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 20% less than the original $70, which is $56. And Bob's gain of $60 is now worth 5% less than the original $30, which is $28.50.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of $40 in the previous round is now worth 20% less, which is $32. And Bob's gain of $60 is now worth 5% less, which is $57.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."
