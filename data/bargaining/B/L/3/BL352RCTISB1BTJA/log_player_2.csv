"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  Since there are a lot of rounds left, rejecting and seeing what Alice's next offer is a good strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need something in return. Meet me halfway? 
# Bob gain: 6800 
# Alice gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has significantly lowered her demands, and the offered split is more favorable than my last offer.  Even with the inflation, this seems like a good deal to secure."
