"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to take a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

However, Bob's offer of meeting me halfway is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being worth even less.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
