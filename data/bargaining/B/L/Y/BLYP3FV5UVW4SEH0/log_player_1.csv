Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a fair but slightly selfish offer, leaving Bob with a small amount. This should incentivize him to accept, as he'll get something instead of nothing if he rejects and we move to the next round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best choice for me.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My gains are worth less, so I'm essentially getting 80% of what I would have in the first round.
* **Bob's Power:**  If I reject, Bob gets to propose in the next round, and with the inflation effect, he's likely to offer me even less.
* **Risk of Nothing:** If we run out of rounds, we both get nothing.

It's not ideal, but accepting guarantees me a significant amount of money, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
