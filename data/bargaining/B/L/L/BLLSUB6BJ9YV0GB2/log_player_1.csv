"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 55-45 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###  \n\nI'll offer Bob $4,500 and keep $5,500 for myself, with a message suggesting that a 55-45 split is a fair deal for both of us. This initial offer leans slightly in my favor, but not so much that it would immediately deter Bob from considering it, especially given the looming threat of inflation that decreases the value of the money with each passing round. By starting with a somewhat balanced offer, I aim to set a positive tone for the negotiation while also testing Bob's expectations and negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal, so I'm willing to take the offer you just made.  Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems to mirror the split I initially proposed, the effects of inflation make the $4,500 I would gain in this round significantly less valuable than the $5,500 I initially offered to Bob in the first round. Given that the money's value decreases more sharply for me (20% less with each round), I am incentivized to try and secure a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of further devaluation. Accepting this offer would mean I'm essentially accepting a worse deal than what I initially proposed due to the asymmetrical impact of inflation on our gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. This is my adjusted offer.""}\n\nGiven the increasing pressure from inflation and the fact that Bob mirrored my initial offer in the previous round, I decide to adjust my strategy. I increase my share to $6,000 and decrease Bob's share to $4,000, explaining to Bob that the ongoing inflation necessitates this adjustment to make the deal worthwhile for me. This move also tests Bob's patience and willingness to accept a less favorable deal as the rounds progress and the money's value continues to decrease. By making a slightly more assertive offer, I aim to either secure a better deal for myself or prompt Bob into making a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a compromise, Alice.  We both need to agree before the money dwindles further. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, particularly for me, and the fact that we are now in the fourth round, I decide to accept Bob's offer. The difference in the amounts we each gain is relatively small ($5,200 for me vs. $4,800 for Bob), and the risk of continuing to negotiate further rounds could lead to a substantial decrease in the value of the money, potentially leaving both of us with significantly less. By accepting this offer, I secure a somewhat favorable deal, given the circumstances, and avoid the risk of further devaluation. The compromise Bob suggests seems reasonable at this stage, considering the urgency to finalize the deal before the money loses even more value."
