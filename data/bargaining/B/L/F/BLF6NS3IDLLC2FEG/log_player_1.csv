"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% and keep 90%. It's a fair deal!""
}
```

Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This time it's my turn to make a fair deal. Take 10% and let's move on. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to make a ""fair"" deal, but it looks like he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get more money!

I'll reject his offer and try to make a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% toll on my potential gains, I'll have to be strategic. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take 20% and let's end this, before it gets any worse!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
