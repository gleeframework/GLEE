"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, my gain of 50$ in the second round is worth 40$ in the first round's money.

Since Bob's offer is now 50-50, I'll accept it.
