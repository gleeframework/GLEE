4000.0,6000.0,"Your offer was a bit imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money - if we don't agree now, the pot shrinks for both of us.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is still too far off. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the slightly larger share. This offers a more equitable split while still acknowledging the time value of money.  What do you say?",Alice,3,
