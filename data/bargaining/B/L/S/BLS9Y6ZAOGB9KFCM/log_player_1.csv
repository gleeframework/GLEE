Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 70

``` 

While not ideal, it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Bob's perception of the money's value is decreasing faster than mine. Every round that I reject, his offer will likely get worse from my perspective, even if he's aiming for ""fairness"" in his own eyes.
* **Potential for Worse:** If I reject this round, there's a real chance Bob will offer me even less in the next round, as he's become more desperate and sees the value diminishing. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees me $30. Rejecting risks getting an even worse deal or, in the worst-case scenario, reaching a point where no deal is acceptable to Bob, leaving us both with nothing."
