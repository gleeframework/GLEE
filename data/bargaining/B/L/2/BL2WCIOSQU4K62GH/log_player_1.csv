"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it seems like a reasonable and fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money in the first round. 

In the first round, a 50/50 split would have given me $5,000, which is the same as the $5,000 I would get in this round. However, Bob is offering me $3,000, which is less than the $5,000 I would get in a 50/50 split. 

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I want to be closer to the majority""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is less than the $5,000 I would have gotten in a 50/50 split, but more than the $3,000 he offered me last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a majority 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in the first round. A 50/50 split would have given me $5,000. 

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money in the first round. 

Bob is offering me $4,500, which is more than the $4,000 I offered him in round 3. However, it's still less than the $5,000 I would get in a 50/50 split. 

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than my previous offer and Bob is getting closer to his desired majority.
