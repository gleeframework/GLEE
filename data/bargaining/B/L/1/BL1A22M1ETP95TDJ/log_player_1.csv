"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. Your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, the values are now:

* My gain: 7,000 (10% less than 8,000)
* Bob's gain: 2,400 (20% less than 3,000)

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
