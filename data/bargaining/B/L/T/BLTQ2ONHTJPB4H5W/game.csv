548750.0,451250.0,"Bob, I understand the desire for a quick resolution, but my share is losing value with each round. This offer is a compromise, slightly better for me than last round to account for the inflation.",Alice,3,

570625.0,429375.0,"Bob, we're reaching a critical point. The inflation is significantly impacting my potential gain.  I'm proposing a larger share for me to offset this, but it still allows you to walk away with a significant amount.  Let's close this deal now.",Alice,5,

420000.0,580000.0,"I understand your frustration, Alice, but the reality is that the inflation is heavily impacting your share. This offer is still generous considering the circumstances. I'm willing to end the game now, but I won't go lower than this. It's in your best interest to accept before your share loses even more value.",Bob,8,
