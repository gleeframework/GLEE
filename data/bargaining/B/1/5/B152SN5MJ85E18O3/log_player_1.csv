I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's better to take 400,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round.  Inflation will only make the money worth less, so it's a good deal."
