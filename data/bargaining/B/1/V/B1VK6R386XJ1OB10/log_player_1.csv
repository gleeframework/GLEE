"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 40$ is worth 32$ in the first round's value, which is still a decent share.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
