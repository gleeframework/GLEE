"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, the money I would gain ($100,000) is worth 80% of what it was in the previous round. So, in terms of the original value, I would be getting $125,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
