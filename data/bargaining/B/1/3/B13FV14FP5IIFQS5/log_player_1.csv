"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I think this is a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $600,000 is now worth $570,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I started high and Bob is meeting me in the middle, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
