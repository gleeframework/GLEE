"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm willing to give you a good share""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. I'll keep $600,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it, considering we both want to avoid the 10% inflation penalty in the next round. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it almost evenly, slightly in my favor. This ensures we both benefit from this deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with: {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I think I can get a better deal. Although the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm willing to take the risk and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe I can negotiate a more favorable split, considering we still have 10 rounds left. Bring it on!"

I'll keep $570,000 for myself. I'm trying to find a middle ground, taking into account the 10% inflation penalty from the previous rounds. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. Fingers crossed again!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. Let's be fair and take a deal while it's still worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with: {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the money is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'm still not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get. With 8 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating. I believe I can get a better deal, and I'm not ready to settle for $480,000 just yet. Let's keep playing!"

Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. Fingers crossed again!"
