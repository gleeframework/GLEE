"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the adjusted amounts.

The offer is:
```
# Alice gain: 45 / 0.9 = 50
# Bob gain: 55 / 0.8 = 68.75
```
I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This way, I'm aiming to get a bit more than before, but not too greedy, considering the inflation."
