"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 55-45 in my favor. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice decides!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more. How about we split it 48-52? This takes into account inflation and gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll take the offer since the inflation is taking a bigger toll on me than Alice, and I don't want the money to lose more value. Waiting for further rounds might result in less real value, even if the nominal amount increases."
