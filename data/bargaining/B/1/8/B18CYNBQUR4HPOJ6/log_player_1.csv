"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll give you a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You didn't give me a fair deal last time, now it's my turn to propose a better one! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual amounts:

My gain would be $3,000, which is 90% of $3,300 (10,000 * 0.9).
Bob's gain would be $5,400, which is 80% of $6,750 (10,000 * 0.8).

I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the remaining $9,000 (10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9), which is $4,950, and keeping 45% for myself, which is $4,050."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a better deal than that! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain would be $3,500, which is 71.9% of $4,850 (10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9).
Bob's gain would be $6,500, which is 65.2% of $10,000 (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8).

I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time, but I'm still not sure if I'm getting the best deal. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round, so I'll accept this offer.
