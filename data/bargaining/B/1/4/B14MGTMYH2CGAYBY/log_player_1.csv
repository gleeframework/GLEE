"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but leaves Bob with a small amount. I figure he might accept it, but if he rejects it, the inflation will work in my favor in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a fair offer considering the inflation. While I'd prefer to get more money, accepting this offer guarantees me a sizable share before inflation erodes my potential gains even further."
