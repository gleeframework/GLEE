# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both have a better chance of getting something this way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be reasonable here. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is offering slightly more, the deal is still not favorable enough considering the rapid inflation for Alice.  She needs to push for a larger share before the money loses too much value."

{

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money here. Let's find a middle ground before we both end up with nothing. This offer is my final compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and Bob is unlikely to offer anything better. Accepting this offer ensures Alice gets something, even if it's less than initially hoped for. Waiting any longer risks getting nothing at all."
