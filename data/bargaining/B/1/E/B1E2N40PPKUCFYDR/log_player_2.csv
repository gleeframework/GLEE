"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair, it's in my best interest to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Since my money isn't losing value, I can afford to be a little greedy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think this is a more balanced split, considering the potential for inflation. We can both benefit from reaching a deal now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I've adjusted my offer, but this money is losing value for me fast. We should make a deal now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing all the money.  This offer is good enough for me."
