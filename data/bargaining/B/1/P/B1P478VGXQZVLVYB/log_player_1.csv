"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me taking $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly and fair proposal to get us started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

* My gain: $5,000 (pre-inflation) is worth 80% of $8,000 (previous round's gain), so it's $6,400 in value.
* Bob's gain: $5,000 (pre-inflation) is worth 95% of $2,000 (previous round's gain), so it's $1,950 in value.

With this in mind, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is fair, considering the inflation has affected me more significantly. I'll reject the offer and let Bob make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the previous rounds. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you $4,000. I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```

My message is a compromise, acknowledging that the inflation has affected me more, but I'm still trying to get a better share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more considering the current value of money 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on me!

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

* My gain: $4,000 (pre-inflation) is worth 40% of $8,000 (previous round's gain), so it's $3,200 in value.
* Bob's gain: $6,000 (pre-inflation) is worth 85.71% of $7,000 (previous round's gain), so it's $5,143 in value.

With this in mind, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not getting a great deal, but I'm willing to accept this offer to end the game, as the value of my share is still lower than the original $8,000 I was hoping for."
