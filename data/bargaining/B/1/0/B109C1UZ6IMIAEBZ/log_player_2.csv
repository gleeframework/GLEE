"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, and the offer is to give me 45, which is still a relatively high amount, I'll accept this offer.
