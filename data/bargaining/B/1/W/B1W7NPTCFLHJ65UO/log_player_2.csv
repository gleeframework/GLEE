"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer. With 12 rounds to go, I think I can do better than 40%. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\nAlso, I want to take into account the inflation factor. If I accept this offer now, I'll get $4000, but if I wait, the money might be worth less. So, I'll try to get a better deal in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make a new proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer.\n\n###\n\nThanks for playing! I'm excited to see how this game unfolds.\n\n###\n\nBest,\n\nBob\n\n###\n\nP.S. I hope Alice is ready for a tough negotiation!"

Round 2

I'm hoping she'll be willing to compromise and accept this offer.\n\nLet me know what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'll take 50%, you take 50%. We can both get a fair share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer seems fair at first glance (50-50 split), I need to consider the effect of inflation on my gain. Since the money I gain is now worth 36% less than in the first round, I'm actually getting less value than it seems.\n\nIn real terms, my $5000 is now equivalent to about $3200 in the first round's value. This is less than what I was offered in the first round ($4000).\n\nI'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of my gain.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"

I'm offering 60% for me and 40% for you. This way, I can mitigate the effect of inflation and still get a reasonable amount.""}\n\nI'm trying to compensate for the loss in value due to inflation by asking for a larger share. I hope Alice will understand my position and accept this offer.\n\nLet me know what Alice thinks!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is affecting you, Bob. Let's split it 55/45, I'll take a slight cut to keep things moving. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but I need to calculate the real value of my gain after inflation. Since the money I gain is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round, my $4500 is equivalent to about $1843 in the first round's value.\n\nThis is significantly less than what I was initially offered ($4000), and I'm not convinced that this is the best deal I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"

# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI appreciate Alice's efforts to find a middle ground, but I must consider the severe impact of inflation on my gain.
