"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll have a chance to even things out later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too risky to accept such a small share in the first round, especially considering the inflation. It's better to see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with such a significant difference. Let's try a 60/40 split, but in my favor this time.  We can continue to negotiate towards a more equitable solution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split is tempting, I still believe I can get a better deal. We're both facing inflation, and I'd rather push for a more even split to secure a larger share in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's try 55/45. It's a more balanced split that accounts for inflation, and hopefully, we can find a compromise closer to the middle ground in the next few rounds.""}
