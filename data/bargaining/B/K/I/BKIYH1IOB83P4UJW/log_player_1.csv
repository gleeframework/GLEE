"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars, which is a fair split to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we'll have to account for in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my 45 dollars in this round is actually worth less than my 60 dollars in the first round. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle this round, 50-50. Let's see if we can find a better split later.""
