6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can negotiate further if you think it's too much.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. I propose a 55/45 split in your favor as a counter-offer.  This seems fairer given the inflation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Okay, I understand your point about fairness. I'm willing to compromise, but a 58/42 split feels more balanced considering the inflation we're dealing with. What do you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about a 56/44 split? It's closer to your offer, but still acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us.",Bob,4,
