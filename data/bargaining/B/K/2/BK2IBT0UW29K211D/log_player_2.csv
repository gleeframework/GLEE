Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand your point about fairness. I'm willing to compromise, but a 58/42 split feels more balanced considering the inflation we're dealing with. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4200
