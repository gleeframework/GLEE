"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and simple solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the value of the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 75/25 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share""
}
```

I've adjusted the split to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming for a more balanced distribution of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The offer is still too skewed towards Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept a 65/35 split, especially with the money being worth less and less with each round. I'll wait for a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I've adjusted the split to try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still aiming for a slightly more favorable share for myself, given the ongoing effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, I still want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The offer is still too skewed towards Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially with the money being worth significantly less than it was initially. I'll wait for a more balanced offer, but I'm running out of time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging, let's split it 50/50, it's the fairest way""
}
```

I'm sticking to my original proposal from round 1, but with the knowledge that the money is worth significantly less now. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept a 50/50 split and we can end this game."
