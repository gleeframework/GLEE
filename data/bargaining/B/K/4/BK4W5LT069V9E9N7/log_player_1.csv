"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 equally, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair and simple starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking the majority, but I'll consider his offer.

Since I'm not sure about the inflation effect on Bob, I'll assume that his 60% is still worth the same as my 50% in the first round. In that case, I'd be getting 40% of the original $100, which is $40.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds.
