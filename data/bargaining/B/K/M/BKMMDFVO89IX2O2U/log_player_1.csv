"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $5,000 and keeping $5,000 for myself. The message is a friendly invitation to start the negotiation."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the higher share this time, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 4:6 split. I'd like to try to negotiate for a more favorable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly higher share this time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, trying to inch closer to a 5:5 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly higher share this time, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because the difference between our proposed shares is getting smaller, and I'd rather accept a 4.5:5.5 split than risk going to another round with decreasing value of money."
