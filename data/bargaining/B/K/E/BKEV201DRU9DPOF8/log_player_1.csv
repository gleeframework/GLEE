"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40, I'm willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message indicating that I'm open to negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of inflation.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,

I'm offering to take $5,800 and give Bob $4,200, which is a slight concession from my original offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on the 60-40 split, but I still need to account for inflation. Let's call it 55-45, and hopefully we can finally agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still not convinced by Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I'm not feeling the pressure of inflation like Bob is. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Maybe I can take advantage of Bob's increasing desperation due to inflation!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, since the money is still worth the same to me. You're feeling the pinch of inflation, so let's settle this soon.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $5,700 and give Bob $4,300, which is only a slight concession from my previous offer. I'm trying to apply some pressure on Bob, given that the inflation is affecting his share more and more with each round. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both feeling the pressure of inflation, so let's split it evenly this time. 50-50 is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob's offer is accurate - I'm not feeling the pressure of inflation at all, since the money is still worth the same to me as in the first round. Bob is the one who's feeling the pinch, and I think I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going back to my original offer. You're feeling the effects of inflation, and I'm not. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, which is the same as my original offer. Given that Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and I'm not, I think I have the upper hand in the negotiations. I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this offer. Let's see what he decides!"
