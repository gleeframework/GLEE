"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know there's inflation to consider, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking advantage of the inflation to get a slightly better deal this round.  Let's see if you'll accept this offer!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hit hard and accepting this offer seems like the best option to secure at least some gains."
