"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation factor. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the inflation is hurting me, I think this is the best deal I'm going to get.  It's better than nothing, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer in the next round."
