"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer takes into account the inflation risk over the 12 rounds. I propose we split it 70/30 in favor of you, Bob, to encourage cooperation early on. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 70/30 split in Alice's favor seems like a lot, it's important to remember that this is the very first round. The inflation risk is high, and there's no guarantee that a future offer will be better.  Accepting this offer secures a decent share of the money early on."
