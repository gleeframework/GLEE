"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, with me getting 900,000 dollars and Bob getting 100,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 dollars is worth 450,000 dollars (90% of 500,000). Bob's gain of 500,000 dollars is still worth 500,000 dollars.

I accept Bob's offer.
