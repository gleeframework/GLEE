"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 95% of the original amount, since it's 5% less due to inflation.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Bob's offer is to split the money down the middle, which is a fair offer.
* However, considering the inflation, my gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50 (95% of $50).

I'll decide to reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
