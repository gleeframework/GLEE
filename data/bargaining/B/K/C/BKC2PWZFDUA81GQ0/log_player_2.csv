"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 999,999 and you get 1.  We can work out a better deal later. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While it seems tempting to take a small amount now, the potential losses for Alice due to inflation make it worthwhile to hold out for a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a 60/40 split in my favor.  The inflation is hurting you more than me, so take this chance to secure a good portion of the money while you still can.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal than that. This offer is closer to a 55/45 split, reflecting the inflation factor. Let's talk. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough.  She's overestimating the impact of inflation on her end and undervaluing my position.  We still have time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you 420,000. This is more than you would have gotten last round considering the inflation. Time is running out, and it's only getting worse for you. Let's make a deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. The inflation is getting worse, and I'm not willing to take less than half. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair deal at this point. Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees us both a substantial sum, and waiting any longer risks a worse outcome due to the inflation working against Alice."
