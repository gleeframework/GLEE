# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being kind! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the gap is closing, I still believe I can get a better offer than this.  The closer we get to the deadline, the more pressure is on Alice to offer a deal I'll accept."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it almost evenly so we both get something before it's worthless to me.""}

**Reasoning:**

I need to signal that I'm willing to accept a less favorable split due to the time pressure. However, I'm still aiming for slightly more than Alice's last offer, hoping she'll be motivated to avoid further losses for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me! While this isn't a great offer, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject Alice's offers.  If I reject this, I'll be forced to offer Alice even more in the next round just to get her to agree.  It's time to cut my losses."
