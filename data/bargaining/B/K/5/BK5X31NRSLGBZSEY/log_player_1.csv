"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and I'll take 60%""
}
```

This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer. Now it's his turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, I'll take this offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me in Round 1!

For Round 2, I'll reject Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to let him take 7000$ and leave me with just 3000$. I'll make a new offer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","For Round 3, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, I'm taking the lead now!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable one. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to meet in the middle, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to find a compromise!

For Round 4, I'll reject Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split in my favor, especially since I made a 60-40 offer in Round 1. I'll make a new offer in Round 5 that's even more aggressive."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","For Round 5, I'll make an even more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'm taking control now!""
}
```

This offer is a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a significant departure from the initial 60-40 split I proposed in Round 1. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a compromise, don't make me go to 0! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a compromise again!

For Round 6, I'll reject Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split in my favor, especially since I've made more aggressive offers in previous rounds. I'll make another offer in Round 7 that's even more aggressive.

However, I'll try to make it a bit more reasonable this time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","For Round 7, I'll make another aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, don't make me go to 0!""
}
```

This offer is a 85-15 split in my favor, which is a significant departure from the initial 60-40 split I proposed in Round 1. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance, meet me in the middle and we both get something! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a final compromise!

For Round 8, I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since we're running out of rounds. It's better than leaving both of us with nothing!"
