"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting worse, accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gains due to inflation. It's a risky gamble, but I'm hoping Alice will become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the risk of both of us getting $0 increases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not intimidated by the clock 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision. Alice is clearly playing hardball, and the inflation is eating into potential gains. However, accepting now would mean losing almost half the value compared to the initial rounds.  I'm banking on Alice becoming more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline and the risk of getting $0 looms larger."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This is ridiculous, Alice. We're both losing money because of your greed. Let's be reasonable and split it fairly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have thought of that before you started making low offers 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a painful decision, but the situation has become dire. Inflation has eroded over half the value of my potential gains. While accepting this offer means getting significantly less than a fair share, rejecting it carries a massive risk. If Alice doesn't budge, we'll both end up with nothing. It's better to take a smaller piece of the pie now than risk getting nothing at all."
