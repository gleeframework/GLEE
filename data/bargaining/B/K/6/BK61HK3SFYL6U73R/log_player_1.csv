"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I accept Bob's offer.
