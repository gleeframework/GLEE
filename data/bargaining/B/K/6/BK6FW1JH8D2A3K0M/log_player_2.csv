Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, counting on my fear of inflation to pressure me into accepting a bad deal. However, her offers are still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious and willing to risk a worse outcome to get a fairer share.  It's a gamble, but I need to counter her strategy."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly fair 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a power move.  By going for a 50/50 split, I'm:

* **Demonstrating Strength:**  I'm showing Alice I'm willing to risk getting nothing to achieve a fair outcome.
* **Calling Her Bluff:**  If she's truly being ""reasonable,"" she has no logical reason to reject an even split. 
* **Setting a Clear Boundary:**  This leaves no room for negotiation and forces her to make a decision based on fairness, not greed.

This is a risky move, but the halfway point of the negotiations is a strategic time to make a stand."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 isn't really 50/50 with inflation 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use my words against me, but she's still not acknowledging the inherent unfairness of the situation. By saying ""Your 50/50 isn't really 50/50"", she's admitting she understands the impact of inflation but refusing to budge on her position. This tells me she might be willing to take it down to the wire. I need to show some flexibility, but not at the cost of being walked all over."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Let's be pragmatic. I'm compromising. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Retreat:**  A small retreat from the 50/50 demand signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Offering 48% is still significantly better than her previous offers and reinforces my seriousness about getting a fair share.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is on Alice to accept a reasonable deal before time runs out.  My message emphasizes this urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this deal 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but accepting is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  With only 4 rounds left, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains at an alarming rate. Accepting now guarantees a payout, while further rejections risk a much worse outcome.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Her consistent rejections and minimal concessions show she's willing to push this to the very end. She's likely banking on me panicking as my potential earnings dwindle.
* **Minimizing Losses:** While 45% is far from ideal, it's better than the risk of getting nothing if I continue to reject and gamble on her offering something better in the final rounds. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but sometimes taking a smaller piece of the pie is better than holding out for too much and ending up with nothing."
