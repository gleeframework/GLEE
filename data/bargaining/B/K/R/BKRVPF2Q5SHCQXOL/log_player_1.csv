"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split and can always negotiate later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure why you suggested 20, I think 50 is a more reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my potential gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $76.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think 50% is a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer.
