"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the potential for future rounds with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
