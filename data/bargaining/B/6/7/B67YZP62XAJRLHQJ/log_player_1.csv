Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this quickly and both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm not willing to lose more than I have to. Let's get this done before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains.  While his offer is closer to a 50/50 split in his eyes, I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round as the pressure mounts on him."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a reasonable offer, especially considering the time constraint and the decreasing value. Let's settle this now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, Alice.  I'm willing to take a bigger risk here, but this is my final offer.  Let's finish this before we both lose even more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate, and his offer reflects that. While he's willing to take a hit due to inflation, the deal is still heavily skewed in his favor.  I'm betting he'll be significantly more flexible in the next round to avoid walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. A fair 50/50 split. Let's end this now and both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Time is becoming critical, and Bob's desperation is increasing. By offering a 50/50 split at this stage, I'm aiming to appear reasonable while maximizing the chance of securing a deal before we hit the final rounds.  Bob's potential gains are shrinking rapidly, making this offer increasingly appealing compared to the risk of getting nothing."
