"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a warning that I'm not planning to make a lowball offer again. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's trying to be reasonable, but I'm not going to fall for it just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in splitting it evenly, especially since the value of my share is decreasing with each round. I want to maximize my gain while Bob's gain is still relatively stable. Next round, it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to bite, and my share is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount. The message is a warning that I'm not going to make it easy for him to get a better deal. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly, and Bob's offer seems like a decent compromise. However, I'm not sure if I want to give him the larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up the larger share just yet, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob to make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of my share is continuing to decrease, and I need to make a strong offer to compensate for the loss.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. Take it or walk away!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm trying to make it a more attractive option by giving him a slightly larger share than in previous rounds. The message is a warning that I'm not going to make any further concessions. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end. Let's be reasonable and split it 70/30 this time. It's better than nothing! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. However, I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best option.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially since I'm getting a smaller share than in previous rounds. I think I can do better, but I'm running out of time. I'll have to make a stronger offer next round or risk losing everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of my share is continuing to decrease, and I need to make a strong offer to maximize my gain.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm trying to make it a more attractive option by giving him a slightly larger share than in the previous round. The message is a warning that I'm not going to make any further concessions. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm willing to give you 20% this time, but we need to agree quickly. This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. However, 20% is a very low offer, and I'm not sure if I want to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a small share, even if it's my last chance to get something. I'm hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round, but I'm running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly, and I'm getting desperate. However, I'm not going to give up yet.

Here's my proposal for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Last stand, Bob. We're splitting it down the middle. Take it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is the same as his previous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it now that the value of my share is so low. The message is a desperate attempt to get him to agree. Your turn, Bob!"
