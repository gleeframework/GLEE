This is getting very risky, but accepting an offer where I get less than Alice is hard to stomach given that I lose money to inflation each round. Let's hope Alice gets nervous and makes a better offer soon."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation with every round that passes. My offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. Let's end this now and both get something.""}"
