"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too low for me, Alice. Let's meet in the middle.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but I need a bit more than your last offer. This is a compromise, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a good deal for both of us with the inflation considered.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to reach an agreement soon. I'm willing to meet you halfway to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Reason: Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is better than risking getting a worse offer later due to the increasing inflation. Getting $4500 now is better than potentially getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.
