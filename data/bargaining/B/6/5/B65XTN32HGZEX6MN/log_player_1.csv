"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a split of $9,000 for myself and $1,000 for Bob.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred a more even split, accepting this offer is the best choice considering the inflation factor. If I reject this, I'll have to make a counter offer, and the next round will further reduce the value of the money I receive."
