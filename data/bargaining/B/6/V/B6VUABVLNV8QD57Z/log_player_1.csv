"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. My message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept this offer and end the game early."
