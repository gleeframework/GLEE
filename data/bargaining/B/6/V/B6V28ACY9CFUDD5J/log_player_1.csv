Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can try to do better next round 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective gains as follows:

My gain: 40
Bob's gain: 60 * 0.95 (since it's worth 5% less) = 57

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather get a better deal. My next offer will aim to take advantage of the inflation difference.
