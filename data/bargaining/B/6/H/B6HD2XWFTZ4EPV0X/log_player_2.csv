Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is literally disappearing before our eyes. My final offer is $620,000 for me and $380,000 for you. Take it or leave it, but let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the time pressure but is still trying to take a significantly larger share. While the offer is slightly better than her previous one, I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer deal.  The inflation is hurting me more, but we still have several rounds left, and walking away with nothing benefits no one."
