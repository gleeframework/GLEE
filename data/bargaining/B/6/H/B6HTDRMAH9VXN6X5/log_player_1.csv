I'll start by offering a slightly unfair split, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, I'm going to reject it. I'm banking on the fact that inflation is hitting Bob harder than me.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to counter with a slightly more equitable offer.  I'm aware that inflation is making the money worth less, but I'm still aiming for a decent chunk of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better deal than Bob's previous offer, and the inflation has likely eroded a significant portion of his initial advantage. A 50/50 split is fair given the circumstances, so I'll accept."
