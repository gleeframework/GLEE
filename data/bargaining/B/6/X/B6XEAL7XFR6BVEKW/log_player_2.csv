"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer while it still holds value! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a more equitable split would be fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's work together and find a solution that benefits both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and that money is losing value for you.  I'm offering a reasonable deal - let's wrap this up! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something, even if it's less than ideal."
