Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's see if we can improve from here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I like the idea of matching fairness.

I accept Bob's offer of $5,000 each. Let's see if we can do better in the next round!"
