Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to see if I can get a better deal. There's no reason to settle for 50/50 right away, especially with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to hold out for a better deal. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but I want to see if I can push for a larger share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to budge a little more, but I think 65/35 is a good balance considering the inflation. Let's try to reach an agreement this time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned about the inflation, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hit hard. This offer is a decent compromise, and accepting it is the best way to ensure I get something out of this deal."
