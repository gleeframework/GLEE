I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair, and even though the money is worth less for me,  I'm not going to give up 95% of the money this early in the game. I'm confident I can do better.  Let's see what happens next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try to be more reasonable this time.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I think it's time to compromise a little bit, but still secure a significant portion of the money for myself.  Let's see if this offer will be accepted."
