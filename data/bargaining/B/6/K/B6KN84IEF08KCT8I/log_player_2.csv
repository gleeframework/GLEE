Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a little more this time, Bob.  But I'm still willing to split it fairly. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Bot

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Bot
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more than half since it's losing value fast for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere.  I'm willing to take a bit more this round, but I don't want to keep going back and forth. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### Bot
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob due to inflation, and Alice's offer, although not perfect, is getting closer to what Bob might end up with if the game continues, it makes sense for Bob to accept the offer at this point. Further rounds would only decrease the value of what Bob can gain, making a less favorable offer more acceptable to avoid greater loss."
