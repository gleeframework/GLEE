4500.0,5500.0,"I'm feeling a bit more generous, but I'm sure you can see the value of a deal now.  Let's split it more evenly this time, with me taking 55% and you taking 45%.  What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Okay, I see we're both being stubborn. Let's split it 50/50 this time.  It's the fairest offer, and with the inflation hitting us both, we're only going to lose more money by dragging this out.",Alice,3,
