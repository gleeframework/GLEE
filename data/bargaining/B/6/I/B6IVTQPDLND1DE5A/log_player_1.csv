I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although the split is slightly more even than before, I was hoping for a more significant improvement. The gap between our gains is still too large, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 48.4% of the total. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."

I'm proposing a 52/48 split, which is a more equal distribution of the funds. I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping that this will be the deal that finally gets accepted."
