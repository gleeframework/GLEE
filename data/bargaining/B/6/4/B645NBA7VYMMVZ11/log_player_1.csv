"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share (95%) and Bob a small share (5%). Since the money is worth less with each round, it's in my best interest to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation significantly reduces the value of money with each round. It's better to secure a share of 40 now than risk getting nothing in the future."
