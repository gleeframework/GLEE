Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less in the next round.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting a significantly smaller share, it's better than getting nothing.  The inflation is going to eat away at the value of the money with each passing round, so it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
