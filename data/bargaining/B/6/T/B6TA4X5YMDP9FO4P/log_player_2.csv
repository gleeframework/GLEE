"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, I'll get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, it doesn't account for the inflation difference between us. I'm only losing 10% per round, while Alice loses 20%. This means that by rejecting the offer, I can potentially get a better deal in the next round, where I get to propose the split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I propose a 5500/4500 split. It accounts for the inflation difference - we both lose value, but I lose less, so it's fairer for me to get slightly more."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on me, I need a bit more to compensate 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is slightly better for me than my previous offer. While I'm still losing more than Alice, the inflation hit is significant enough that I'm not sure I can get a significantly better deal in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent share, and any further negotiation risks losing a considerable amount of value."
