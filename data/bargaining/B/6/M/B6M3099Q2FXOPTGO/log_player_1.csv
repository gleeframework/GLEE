"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer amounts considering the impact of inflation on both players.
Given that with each round, the money's value decreases by 5% for Alice and 20% for Bob, it's strategic to consider these devaluations in the proposal. However, since this is the first round, we'll focus on making an offer that is slightly favorable to Alice but still reasonable for Bob to consider, without immediately factoring in the inflation for this initial offer.

### Step 2: Decide on the message to accompany the offer.
The message should be concise, clear, and perhaps hint at the strategy or flexibility for negotiation. Given the rules, a straightforward approach might be best for the first round.

### Step 3: Construct the offer in the specified JSON format.
Based on the steps above, the offer should be slightly favorable to Alice but still attractive to Bob. A 60-40 split could be a starting point, considering it leaves room for negotiation and reflects a more aggressive starting stance by Alice.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Starting with a fair split, open to adjustments.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is money. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer considering the impact of inflation.
Given the offer and the effects of inflation, we must calculate the actual value of the money offered to Alice and Bob after devaluation. For Alice, the money is worth 5% less than the initial round, and for Bob, it's 20% less.

### Step 2: Calculate the actual value of the offer for both Alice and Bob after inflation.
For Alice, a 5% decrease on her potential gain of $40: $40 * 0.95 = $38.
For Bob, a 20% decrease on his proposed gain of $60: $60 * 0.80 = $48.

### Step 3: Determine if the offer is acceptable based on the calculated values and the strategic position.
Considering the significant drop in value for Bob and the relatively minor decrease for Alice, but also taking into account the strategic aspect of the game where holding out might result in further decreases, we evaluate if $38 is satisfactory for Alice at this stage.

### Step 4: Decide on the response to Bob's offer.
Given the strategic nature of the game and the fact that this is only the second round, Alice might consider rejecting the offer to negotiate a better split in the next round or to maximize her potential gain, considering the inflationary impact on both players.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Adjust the offer considering the previous rejection and inflation impact.
Given that Bob's offer was rejected and considering the impact of inflation, Alice needs to make a more strategic offer. The money's value decreases by 5% for Alice and 20% for Bob with each round. We're now in the third round, so these devaluations compound.

### Step 2: Calculate the current value of the $100 after two rounds of inflation for both players.
For Alice, after two rounds of 5% decrease: $100 * (0.95)^2 = $90.25.
For Bob, after two rounds of 20% decrease: $100 * (0.80)^2 = $64.

### Step 3: Determine the offer amounts based on the strategic position and inflation impact.
Considering the decreasing value and the need for a strategic offer that Bob might accept, Alice could propose a split that slightly favors her but is mindful of Bob's decreasing value.

### Step 4: Decide on the message to accompany the offer.
The message should convey a sense of urgency and openness to negotiation, given the decreasing value of the money for both parties.

### Step 5: Construct the offer in the specified JSON format.
Considering the strategic position and the need for an attractive offer, a 55-45 split could be proposed, with the understanding that the actual value to both parties is less due to inflation.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""
}
```"
