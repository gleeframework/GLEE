**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:** The value of the $1,000,000 is rapidly decreasing due to the 10% inflation rate per round.  Delaying further significantly eats into any potential gains for both of us.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has consistently aimed for the larger share. Her message implies this is her last ""reasonable"" offer, suggesting future offers might be even less favorable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks getting a worse deal in later rounds where the money is worth even less. Accepting now guarantees a payout, even if it's not the ideal split. 

Waiting any longer is likely to result in a smaller net gain, even if Bob manages to secure a slightly larger share in a later round."
