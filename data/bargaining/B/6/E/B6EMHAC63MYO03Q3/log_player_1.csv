"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount. I'm keeping $8,000 for myself, which is 80% of the original amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $3,600 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I think I can live with it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
