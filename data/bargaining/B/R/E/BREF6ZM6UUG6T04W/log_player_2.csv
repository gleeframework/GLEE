This is a tough one, and a classic illustration of the time pressure in game theory.  Here's why I'm accepting, even though it's not ideal:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The longer this goes on, the less my share is actually worth. Waiting any longer is highly risky.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:**  Her last offer and message indicate she's firm on this split. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in the later rounds risks getting zero if we don't reach an agreement."
