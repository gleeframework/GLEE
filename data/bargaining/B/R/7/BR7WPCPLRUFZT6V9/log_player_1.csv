"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, and I'll take the smaller 60% share this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority share this round, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is less attractive than it initially seems.

I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55/45 split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and I think 55/45 is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","An even split sounds reasonable, considering the offers we've seen so far.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's split it evenly and end the game!"
