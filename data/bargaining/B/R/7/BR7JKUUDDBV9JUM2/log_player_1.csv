"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I propose a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor.  Since we have 12 rounds, even with the 20% inflation, I'll still end up with a sizable amount.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal, considering the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers. With 12 rounds remaining, the inflation rate is a factor to consider, but even with the 20% loss per round, I'm still getting a significant amount. It's better to secure something now than to risk getting nothing in the end."
