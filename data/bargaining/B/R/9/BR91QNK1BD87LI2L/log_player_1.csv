"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair offer. Let's split it 70-30.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me $70 and Bob $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering I get to make the offer this round. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 40. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I can do better than 40. Can you meet me at 50-50?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will meet me in the middle and we can split the remaining $60 (after the first two rounds) 50-50."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. 55-45 seems reasonable.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $55 and Bob $45."
