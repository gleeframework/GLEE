# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The final round!\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for Alice (18.55% less than the initial amount), I think I've got the upper hand. However, Alice has made a strong statement by offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair solution in most cases.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I'll accept this offer. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk Alice walking away or making an even lower offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIt's a done deal! I'll take my $500,000."
