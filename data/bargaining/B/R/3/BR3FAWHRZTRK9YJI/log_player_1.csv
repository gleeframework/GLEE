"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm looking for a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll aim to get a larger share.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
