"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount to test the waters and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

I'll reject the offer for now and hope to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round for me. I need to be more aggressive to get a good deal.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger share each round, Bob. I'm not going to let you walk all over me!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, hoping to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, I was taking too much. Let's find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less for me now, and Bob is trying to find a middle ground. I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept the offer for now, as it seems like a decent compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
