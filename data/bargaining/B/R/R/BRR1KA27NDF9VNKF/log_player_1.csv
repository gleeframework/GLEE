"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and simple deal!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. This 58-42 split is a fair compromise, don't you think?""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my original proposal, but still takes into account the inflation and Bob's concerns."
