"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, but considering the time value of money. This offer benefits us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:**  The offer is slightly tilted in Alice's favor, acknowledging the time pressure she faces with inflation.
* **Time Value of Money:** By accepting now, Bob avoids the risk of getting a smaller share later if Alice makes increasingly aggressive offers.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct, reasonable, and explains the logic behind the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was close to fair, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Losses:** While not ideal, accepting this offer cuts Alice's losses from inflation. Waiting longer would likely result in even less favorable offers.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** Bob's offer does move closer to the middle ground, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's no guarantee that Alice can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Bob might become more demanding, further eroding Alice's potential gains."
