"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small fraction of the money, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better. I'm not willing to give up as much as half of the money, especially considering that Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but not quite!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount of money and leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but still not quite fair! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's revised proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because, although I'm getting closer to my desired share, I still think I can do better. The fact that Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round makes me think he's being more aggressive with his proposal. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting close, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, taking into account the effects of inflation on Bob's gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up either, let's try to find a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's revised proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because, given the effects of inflation, I think this is a fair compromise. Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I'm getting a decent amount of money. I'm willing to settle for this split to avoid further negotiations."
