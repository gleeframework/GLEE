"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $6,000 I was initially offering is now worth $5,400, and the $4,000 I was leaving for Bob is still worth $4,000.

Bob's new offer is $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him. That's a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation. I accept the offer.
