"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less than the original amount, I need to consider the actual value of the money I'll be getting. In this case, I'll be getting 400,000 dollars, which is equivalent to 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444.44 dollars in the original amount.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I'd like to negotiate further."

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I think 55/45 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values...

Since Bob's offer is worth 27.1% less than the original amount, I need to consider the actual value of the money I'll be getting. In this case, I'll be getting 480,000 dollars, which is equivalent to 480,000 / 0.7279 = 659,111.13 dollars in the original amount.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values...

Since Bob's offer is worth 40.95% less than the original amount, I need to consider the actual value of the money Bob will be getting. In this case, Bob will be getting 490,000 dollars, which is equivalent to 490,000 / 0.5925 = 828,067.45 dollars in the original amount.
