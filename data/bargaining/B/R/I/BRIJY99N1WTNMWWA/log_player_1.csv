Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob acknowledges the inflation, his offer is getting worse for me. I need to hold strong to get a better deal. Bob's amount is decreasing in value faster than mine, so he has more incentive to make a deal soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob, and it's disappearing quickly for you. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. By stating it's my final offer, I create a sense of urgency. 
* **Shifting Focus:** I'm emphasizing the shrinking value for Bob, hoping he'll prioritize securing a deal over maximizing his already dwindling gains.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 7000 is a slight step back to show a willingness to negotiate, but still firmly in my favor."
