"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm also trying to be fair.  I believe that if Bob rejects this offer, he'll lose more money due to the higher inflation rate on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject, Bob will get to make the next offer, and his money will depreciate less, leading to an even worse deal for me in the future."
