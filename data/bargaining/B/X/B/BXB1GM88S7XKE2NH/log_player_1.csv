"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less in Round 2, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the potential gains I could get in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth even less in Round 3, I'll have to be more aggressive with my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! With the money being worth even less, I'll have to be careful. However, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth even less in Round 5, I'll have to be even more aggressive with my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing the same 60-40 split as in Round 1, but I'm hoping Bob will be more desperate now and accept it."
