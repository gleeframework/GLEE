Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. My time is valuable! Accept this fair offer and let's be done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offer is still not in my favor.  He's valuing his time, but he needs to understand that the value of his potential earnings is decreasing with each round. I'll hold out for a better deal."
