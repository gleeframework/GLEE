Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money.  Since we don't know how inflation affects him, I'm trying to secure a large portion of the money for myself early on.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not good for me.  I'm going to reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round.  Inflation is hurting me, but I'm hoping it's hurting Bob even more, and he'll be willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise.  My previous rejection showed him I'm not afraid to walk away from a bad deal, so hopefully he'll take this offer before things get worse for him due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable.  Even though inflation is hitting me hard, I'm still not willing to take such a small share.  The next round might be even worse for Bob, so I'm going to try and hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but not by much.  I'm hoping that Bob will be getting desperate now with the inflation hitting him hard.  I'm still taking the majority, but I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate."
