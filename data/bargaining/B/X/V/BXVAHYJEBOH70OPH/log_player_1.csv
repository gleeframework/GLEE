"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering that I'm trying to incentivize Bob to accept the offer now rather than risking further inflation. The message is a brief explanation of my reasoning, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the inflation hits me harder. This offer accounts for that difference. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I've adjusted my offer. This is as fair as it gets""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to take into account the inflation that has occurred so far. Since the money is worth less to me now, I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share than before. However, I'm still trying to maintain a relatively strong negotiating position. The message is a hint that I'm not willing to go much further in terms of concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer gives you a good amount while acknowledging the inflation disparity. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Time is running out, indeed. But I won't settle for less than this. Take it or risk losing even more to inflation""
}
```

I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer this time, trying to put pressure on Bob to accept. Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'm trying to make the most of it. The message is a clear warning that if Bob rejects this offer, he might end up losing even more value to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose if this goes on. I'm sticking to my offer - it's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
