"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share since I'm making the offer this time.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, especially since I'm getting the smaller share. However, I don't want to risk losing out completely if we don't agree on a split soon.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in future rounds.
