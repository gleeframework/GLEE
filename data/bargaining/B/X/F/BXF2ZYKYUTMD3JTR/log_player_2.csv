"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, Bob can likely get a better deal by waiting. The threat of inflation incentivizes Alice to offer more in subsequent rounds to avoid both players walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than I'd take, but the clock is ticking. Let's close this deal.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob signals that he's aiming for a better deal. Now it's his turn to propose, giving him a strategic advantage.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases. Bob needs to put pressure on Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Reasonable Offer:** Offering Alice $4,500 is still more than the $4,000 she initially proposed. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, which shows her increasing concern about the shrinking pot. However, she's still benefiting from Bob's initial rejection.  Bob should hold out a bit longer to see if he can secure a slightly better deal as the pressure of inflation mounts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, the value is dropping fast. This is a fair deal, let's take it and run before we both lose out.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Urgency:** Bob is slightly lowering his demand from $5,500 to $5,200, signaling a willingness to compromise. However, the message emphasizes the shrinking value of the money, urging Alice to accept before it decreases further. 
* **Psychological Edge:** By framing his offer as ""fair"" and a way to avoid mutual loss, Bob aims to nudge Alice towards a decision in his favor.  
* **Time Constraint:**  With the rounds passing, Bob needs to secure a deal soon. This offer keeps a slight advantage for Bob while increasing the pressure on Alice to accept before time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's compromise before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning.  While not ideal, accepting this offer is now the most logical choice for Bob:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The 18.55% inflation rate is taking a significant chunk out of the potential gains. Holding out for a slightly better split in later rounds carries the risk of losing even more value. 
* **Alice's Position Strengthening:** Alice's offer, while still favoring her, shows a greater willingness to compromise. She likely senses Bob's resolve weakening and might not budge much more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to reject offers drastically increases the risk of walking away with nothing.  Accepting this offer guarantees Bob a reasonable share, even with the impact of inflation."
