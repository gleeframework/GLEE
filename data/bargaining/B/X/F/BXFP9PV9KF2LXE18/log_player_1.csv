I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to secure a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, I'm aware of the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me half the initial amount, which is a good outcome considering the circumstances."
