"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount to start, but still a significant one, and I'm taking the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the amount I'd gain in this round is $4,500 (5000 * 0.9).

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
