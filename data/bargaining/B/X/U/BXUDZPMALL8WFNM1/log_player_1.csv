"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it's still a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer, as he gets something rather than nothing if we continue to play."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and while it's tempting to accept something rather than nothing, I believe I can still get a better deal.  The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, but I'm confident that I can negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a compromise here. I'm decreasing my share from the first round, but still offering Bob more than he offered me.  This reflects the inflation hitting me harder than Bob, but also signals my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is less than my initial proposal and significantly less than what I offered in the previous round, the inflation is really starting to bite.  A 50/50 split is the best I can hope for at this point, and with each passing round, my share will keep shrinking. Accepting guarantees me some money, while rejecting could result in both of us getting nothing."
