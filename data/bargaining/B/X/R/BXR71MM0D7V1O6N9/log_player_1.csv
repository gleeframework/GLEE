"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is 30% of the original $100. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate or propose a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious with my decision. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable proposal, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
