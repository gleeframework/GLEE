"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to see if he'll accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
