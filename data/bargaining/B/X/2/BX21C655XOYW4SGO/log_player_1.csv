I propose a 50/50 split this time.  While I believe I could still get a better deal, I'm not sure how many rounds I'm willing to risk with inflation constantly working against me. A fair split now is better than risking nothing."

I'm going to try a slightly more even split, aiming for a 45/55 split in Bob's favor. The inflation is getting serious, and I'm worried about losing out. I'm hoping this offer shows I'm serious about finding a deal, but also that I'm not willing to accept a completely unfavorable one."

I'm proposing a 30/70 split in Bob's favor. With the inflation at this point, I'm desperate for any deal that gives me something. I'm hoping this final offer will convince him to accept, as there are only two rounds left, and I'm afraid we'll both lose everything."
