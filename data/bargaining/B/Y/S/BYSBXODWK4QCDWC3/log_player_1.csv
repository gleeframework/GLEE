Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving myself 90% of the money. Since it's the first round, I'm trying to maximize my gain, and I think Bob will likely accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, accepting this offer is still the best choice.  My gain is only worth 900 in this round, but rejecting it means I have to make an offer, and Bob will likely reject anything that doesn't give him at least 9000, effectively giving me nothing."
