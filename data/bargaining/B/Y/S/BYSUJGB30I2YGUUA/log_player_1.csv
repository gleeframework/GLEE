"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll think it's a good idea to take it and get half of the remaining money. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
