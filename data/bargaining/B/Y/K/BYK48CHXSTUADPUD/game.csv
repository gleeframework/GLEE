350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  Consider the rapid devaluation -  it hurts you far more than me. This ensures we both walk away with something substantial.",Bob,2,

700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll take 70% and you get 30%, but I'm not going lower than that. The inflation is hitting us both hard, but I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, time is running out, and we're both losing money! My last offer was more than generous. This is a 55/45 split in my favor. You need to consider the decreasing value of the money - another refusal only hurts us both. Let's be logical and end this.",Bob,4,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, we're both losing more money with each passing round. I'm dropping my demands to 60%, but I need to ensure I get something worthwhile.  This is my final offer.  Accept it, or we both walk away with nothing.",Alice,5,
