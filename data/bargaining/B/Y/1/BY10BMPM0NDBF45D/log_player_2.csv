Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Round 2\n\nMy turn! Since the money is decreasing in value, I want to make a reasonable offer that also takes into account that I'm willing to walk away if it's not good enough for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer still gives you a good share while acknowledging the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
