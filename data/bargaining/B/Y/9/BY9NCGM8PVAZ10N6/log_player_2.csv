**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering slightly less than the previous round, but the value of the deal is diminishing for her significantly faster than it is for me. It's still better for me to hold out and aim for a more favorable split, closer to my last offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this soon.  This is a fair offer and gives you a larger share than if we let this drag on.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  We're past the halfway point. It's crucial to emphasize the time pressure. 
* **Slight Concession:** Increasing my offer by $100 shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Losses:**  Alice needs to understand that delaying hurts her more than me. This offer might be her best chance to secure a reasonable amount."
