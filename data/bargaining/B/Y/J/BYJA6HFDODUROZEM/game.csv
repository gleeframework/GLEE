,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I think a more even split is fair.  I'm proposing we each take $5,500.  This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I appreciate you wanting to split more evenly, but we need to factor in the inflation. My offer gives us both a fair share while considering the decreasing value. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. The inflation is starting to bite, and if we keep rejecting each other, we'll both end up with less.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get a decent share before the value drops further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your point about a 50/50 split, but we need to be strategic about the inflation. This offer gets us both a decent sum while acknowledging the time pressure.  Let's close the deal!",Alice,5,
