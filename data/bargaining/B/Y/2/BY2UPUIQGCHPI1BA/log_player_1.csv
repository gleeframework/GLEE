"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, the declining value of the money significantly disadvantages me in later rounds. I need to aim for a larger share now to compensate for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it - it's in your best interest to accept.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  It's round 3, and the money is losing value quickly. I need to push for a resolution.
* **Strategic Bluff:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to pressure Bob into accepting. While I'm willing to negotiate further, this strong stance might be enough to get me a favorable deal.
* **Balancing Act:**  This offer is less extreme than my initial proposal, showing some flexibility, but still heavily favors me due to the rapid inflation working against Bob."
