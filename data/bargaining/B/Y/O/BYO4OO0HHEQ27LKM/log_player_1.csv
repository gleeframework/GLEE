"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. In this case, I'll reject the offer since I'd be getting only 20% of the original $100, which is a relatively small share. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

This way, I'll get 45% of the original $100, which is a slightly higher share than before, considering the reduced value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of money! Given the significantly reduced value of money, I'll have to be even more cautious with my decision.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer since 15% of the original $100 is still a relatively small amount, but it's better than going into further rounds and risking getting an even smaller share.
