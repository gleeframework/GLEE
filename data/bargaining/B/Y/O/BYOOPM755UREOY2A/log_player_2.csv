Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, accepting this offer would still give her a significantly larger share.  The impact of inflation is becoming more significant, but it's not yet at a level where we should panic and take any offer presented. Holding out for a better deal in the next few rounds is still the stronger strategy."
