"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll consider the effective gains in this round. 

For this round, my effective gain would be 400,000 / 0.8 = 500,000, and Bob's effective gain would be 600,000 / 0.8 = 750,000.

I'll reject the offer since I'd be getting a smaller share of the effective gain.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm offering Bob $450,000, and I'll take $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll. Since the money is worth 48.8% less now, I'll calculate the effective gains. 

For this round, my effective gain would be 450,000 / 0.5168 (1 - 0.4832) = 870,000, and Bob's effective gain would be 550,000 / 0.5168 = 1064,000.

Considering the effective gains, I'll reject the offer since I'd be getting a smaller share of the effective gain.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The game is heating up! Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering Bob an equal share of $500,000, and I'll take the other $500,000. It's a 50-50 split."
