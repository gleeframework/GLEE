Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Assess the impact of inflation on the current offer.
Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me (Bob) and 5% less for Alice, we are now in Round 4. This means that for me, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round (1 - 0.9^3), and for Alice, it's worth 14.36% less (1 - 0.95^3).

### Step 2: Evaluate the previous offers and the rationale behind them.
Alice initially proposed a 60/40 split in her favor, citing her lower inflation rate as justification. I rejected this offer and proposed a 55/45 split in my favor in Round 2, which Alice then rejected. In Round 3, Alice offered an even 50/50 split, which I also rejected.

### Step 3: Consider the decreasing value of money and the need for compromise.
Given the decreasing value of the money and the limited number of rounds left, there's a growing urgency to reach an agreement. A compromise that takes into account the inflation rates and the need for both parties to feel the deal is somewhat fair is necessary.

### Step 4: Formulate a new offer that takes into account the current state of negotiations and the impact of inflation.
Considering the rejection of the 50/50 split and the impact of inflation, my next offer should still aim to slightly favor me but also be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer. A split of 52/48 in my favor could be seen as a compromise, considering the money's decreasing value and the need to reach an agreement before the money becomes worthless.

### Step 5: Draft the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the considerations above, my offer for Round 4 would be:

```
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the urgency and inflation impact, I propose a 52/48 split as a compromise.""}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{5200}$"
