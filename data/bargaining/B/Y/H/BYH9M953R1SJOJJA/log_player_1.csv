{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a simple and fair way to divide the money."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer because I think it's not fair. Bob is taking a larger share of the money, which is worth 20% less than the original amount, but still gaining more than I am. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

# Bob gain: 7000

I'm not willing to accept this offer because I think it's too extreme. Bob is proposing a huge disparity in the shares, and I'm not willing to accept a share that's worth only 30% of the original amount. I'd like to make another counteroffer and try to find a more balanced solution."
