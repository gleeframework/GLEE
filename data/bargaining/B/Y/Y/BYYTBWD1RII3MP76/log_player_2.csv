Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. I'm offering a slightly better split to try and reach an agreement. It's beneficial for both of us to settle sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced yet. I'll see if I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We need to be practical. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is reasonable, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's better to take what we can get before the value of the money decreases even further."
