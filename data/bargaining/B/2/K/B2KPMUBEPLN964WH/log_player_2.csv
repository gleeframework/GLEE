Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $60, you take $40, and we both walk away happy. This seems fair considering the money will be worth less as time goes on.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn.  I understand you want a good deal, but my initial offer was more than fair considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle - $55 for me, $45 for you.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
