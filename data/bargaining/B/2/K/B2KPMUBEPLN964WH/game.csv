60.0,40.0,"Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $60, you take $40, and we both walk away happy. This seems fair considering the money will be worth less as time goes on.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think we can do better than that. If we both take a little less, we can secure a good amount now, before the money loses more value.  Let's split it 55/45, with me getting 55.  What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, my turn.  I understand you want a good deal, but my initial offer was more than fair considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle - $55 for me, $45 for you.  This is my final offer.",Alice,3,
