Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We've both lost value due to inflation. I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000

{

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a more even split, we are still losing significant value to inflation.  I'm betting Bob will be more willing to compromise as the deadline approaches."
