"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is a fair starting point, I'm going to reject it. I want to see what kind of negotiation we can do, considering the difference in our inflation rates. I might be able to get a better deal for myself in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point, considering the difference in our inflation rates.  Let's see if we can work something out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 60/40 is a fairer split considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable given the inflation rates and the fact that we're only in round 3. I'm willing to accept it and avoid further rounds where the value of the money keeps decreasing."
