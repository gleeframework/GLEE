"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to start with a fair split. Let's see if you agree.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'll actually gain $4750.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I'm hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to 55% of the initial $10,000, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5200 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so I'll actually gain $4464.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.
