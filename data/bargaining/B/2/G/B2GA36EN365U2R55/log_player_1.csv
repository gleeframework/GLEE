"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can't do better than that!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, as I believe fairness should be our priority. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh?

I'm not sure I'm ready to give up my advantage just yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You said fairness is key, but I'm not getting any younger. Meet me in the middle!""
}
