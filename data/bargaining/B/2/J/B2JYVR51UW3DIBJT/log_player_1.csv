"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take nearly all the money. As the first mover, I have the advantage and can leverage this to my benefit.  However, to avoid outright rejection, I'll offer Bob a token amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly more than my previous offer, it's still not a good deal.  I can likely do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more equitable offer than Bob's previous one, and I believe it's fair considering we are now both in a position to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than the previous one, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm confident I can get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair and equitable offer, especially considering the significant inflation that has occurred.  It's time to end this game on a more balanced note."
