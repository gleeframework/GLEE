"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair and reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced proposal, considering the initial 4:1 was too extreme. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the proposal, as I'm still getting less than half of the total amount. I'd like to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""A more balanced proposal, considering the initial extremes. Let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the total amount, which is $550,000, and Bob gets 45%, which is $450,000. I'm trying to find a more balanced proposal that takes into account the initial extremes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's proposal is a good one, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. A 50/50 split seems like a fair and reasonable proposal, especially since we're getting closer to the end of the game. I'm willing to accept this offer and split the remaining amount evenly."
