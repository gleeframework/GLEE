60.0,40.0,I propose we split the money 60/40. It's a fair offer that lets us both walk away with something.  What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think 60/40 is a bit biased, how about we do 55/45? It's a more even split.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a more even split, but time is running out and the money is losing value. I'll meet you halfway â€“ 55/45. Let's close this deal before it's too late.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Thanks for meeting me halfway, but I think we can do even better. How about 52/48? It's a small concession, but every bit counts with inflation eating away at our gains.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's fair, simple, and ensures we both leave with something substantial. Don't let greed cloud your judgment.",Alice,5,
