"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me, since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
