"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the original $10,000. I'm keeping $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, considering the inflation we both face. Let's see if we can end this early. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is now worth 5% less than the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5,500 is now worth 10% less than the $4,000 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to accept this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a slight edge given the initial proposal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,800, which is a 48% share of the original $10,000. I'm keeping $5,200, which is 52% of the original amount."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  The inflation is making things complicated, and it's better for both of us to get something than risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,200 is now worth 14.26% less than the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round, and Bob's gain of $4,800 is now worth 27.1% less than the $4,000 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a 50-50 split, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
