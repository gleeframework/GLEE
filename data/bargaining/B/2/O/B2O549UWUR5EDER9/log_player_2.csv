Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a bit more in your favor, acknowledging that a 50/50 split isn't ideal for me with the inflation. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000
