"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll consider the effective gain as 95% of $400,000, which is $380,000.

Similarly, since the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, he's effectively gaining 80% of $600,000, which is $480,000.

Considering the reduced values, I'm not thrilled about the offer. I'll reject it for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm adjusting the split to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
