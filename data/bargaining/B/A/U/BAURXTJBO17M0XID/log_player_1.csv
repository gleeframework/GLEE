"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the larger share this round""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, the numbers are:

Alice gain: 500000
Bob gain: 500000

I'll accept Bob's offer. I'll take 500,000 and we can end the game.
