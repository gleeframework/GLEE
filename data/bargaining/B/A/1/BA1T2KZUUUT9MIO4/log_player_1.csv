}

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob will receive 40%, which is $4,000. I've attached a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a fair split. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that. This offer is a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
