"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000. I want to secure a large portion of the money early, knowing that the value will decrease in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my share slightly to 800,000, while increasing Bob's to 200,000. This is still a good deal for me, and I'm hoping Bob will realize it's better than the risk of continuing and potentially getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but I'm still aiming for a majority. Bob is clearly being stubborn, but I believe I can secure a good deal by sticking to my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I still believe I can secure a decent portion of the money.  With each round, the value of the money is decreasing, and I need to act decisively to avoid losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
This offer is closer than the last, but I am still holding out for more. While the risk of getting nothing is growing, I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds. I'm sure Bob will eventually see reason and compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're at the halfway point, and the value of the money keeps decreasing.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob is finally willing to compromise. I believe this is the fairest and most reasonable offer, and I'm hoping he accepts it."
