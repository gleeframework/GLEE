"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I deserve a bit more""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message that suggests I deserve a bit more. This way, I'm opening the negotiation with a slightly favorable offer to myself, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, since the money loses value each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is losing value, accepting $4000 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a similar offer in the first round due to inflation. Plus, Bob is offering me less than half, which doesn't seem fair considering the original amount and the fact that the money loses more value for him than for me. I'll hold out for a better offer or try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to be closer to even value over time.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself, adjusting the split slightly to account for the inflation. This way, I'm still getting a bit more, but acknowledging the impact of inflation on the value of the money. By framing it as an adjustment for inflation, I'm hoping Bob will see it as a more reasonable and fair offer."
