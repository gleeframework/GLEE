"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This is a fair offer as it gives me a majority of the money while still giving Bob a small share.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my previous proposal!  I'll reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'll offer Bob $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself. This offer still gives me a larger share, but it's a compromise from my previous offer, and hopefully it's enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd consider fair given the inflation. I'll accept this offer."
