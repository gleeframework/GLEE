"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split relatively even, but a little extra for me to start. This ensures we both benefit from playing rather than letting the money devalue. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this is a good start, Bob can likely do better than 4750.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further to secure a deal before the money starts devaluing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can both benefit from getting the money now before it loses value.""}
