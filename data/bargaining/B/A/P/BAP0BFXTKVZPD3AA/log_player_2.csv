Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share Alice, but this split is more reflective of the declining value over time.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but the deal has to favor me slightly to account for the faster inflation I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
