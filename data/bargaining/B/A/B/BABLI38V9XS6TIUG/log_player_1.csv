"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, I'll give you a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have gotten a better deal last round, but I'm willing to compromise now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is offering a good deal, especially since the money is worth less in this round. I'd like to negotiate further to see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, trying to balance the compromise while keeping a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share to live comfortably in my golden years. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob's message is a bit humorous, but I'll focus on the numbers.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The numbers are almost the same as my previous offer, and I'm not willing to accept a deal that doesn't take into account the significant decrease in value due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to make sure I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000 and keeping $420,000 for myself, trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and protecting my own interests."
