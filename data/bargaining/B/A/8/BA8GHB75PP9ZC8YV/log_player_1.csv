{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk!""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, where I'll take the majority of the initial $100."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. I'd rather not give him a larger share later, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation.
