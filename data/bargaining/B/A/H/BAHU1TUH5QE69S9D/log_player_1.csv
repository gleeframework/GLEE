"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and you get 20%, which is $20. The message is a friendly introduction to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a higher share this time! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update.

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* My share: $40 / 0.8 = $50 (since it's 20% less than the original $80)
* Bob's share: $60 / 0.8 = $75

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting less than I proposed initially. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a compromise between my initial offer and the previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* My share: $20 / 0.5208 (48.8% less than the original $100) = $38.38
* Bob's share: $80 / 0.5208 = $153.85 (ouch, that's a lot more than the original $100!)

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting a very small share and Bob would be getting an enormous amount, which doesn't seem fair. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Going for broke, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, which is a bold move, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but this time it's for real 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* My share: $50 / 0.326 (67.23% less than the original $100) = $153.05 (ouch, that's a lot more than the original $100!)
* Bob's share: $50 / 0.326 = $153.05 (ouch, that's a lot more than the original $100!)

Wait, this is actually a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer. I'll accept this offer and we can finally end the game. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
