Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Take this before it gets worse 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a 40/60 split sets a terrible precedent. I need to show her I'm willing to risk it going to further rounds to get a more reasonable deal. There's a chance she'll offer a better split in the next round to avoid the game dragging on."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my last offer.  Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I need to signal that I'm serious about not getting continuously lowballed. Offering a 45/55 split is still  better for Alice than a 50/50 split in later rounds due to the inflation affecting my gains. This offer might be enough to get her to agree, and if not, I'm prepared to play it out to the very end."
