"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer aims to secure a large share of the money for Alice while still giving Bob a small amount to potentially encourage acceptance. It's a gamble, as Bob could reject and potentially get a better offer in the next round, but it's a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, offering a significantly smaller share to Alice.  It's a risky move for Bob, as Alice could potentially get a better deal in the next round. I'll reject and see what happens."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer is a compromise. It's still advantageous for Alice, but it's less aggressive than the initial offer. It aims to entice Bob into accepting while still securing a decent amount for myself. Inflation is a factor, but I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I think I can get.  While the inflation is hurting me, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I'll reject and continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With the inflation hitting both of us harder, I'm taking a more neutral stance. This offer gives Bob a larger share than before, but it also ensures I'm not getting a significantly worse deal. It's a gamble, but it could be enough to entice Bob to accept before the inflation hits us even harder."
