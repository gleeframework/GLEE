"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and we can discuss and adjust as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best approach, especially since I'm losing value due to inflation. I'd like to propose something that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. I'm trying to account for the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, while still being open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a larger share 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the fact that Bob is still getting a larger share, and the decreasing value of the money is making it harder for me to get a fair deal. I'd like to propose something that takes into account the increasing gap between our proposed shares."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and inflation, let's meet in the middle again.""}

I'm proposing that I get $52 and Bob gets $48. I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and the decreasing value of the money, and I'm willing to meet in the middle again to see if we can find a compromise."
