"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know the stakes, but a near even split seems reasonable for us both to walk away happy.

# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal. The 5% decrease in value for Alice might make her more willing to compromise in the next rounds."

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting me more than you, but I'm willing to meet in the middle with a 50/50 split. This ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation affecting Alice's gain, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next rounds. The fact that Alice is already feeling the pinch might make her more flexible as the rounds progress."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I think this offer is more than reasonable. It's still a substantial amount for you, considering the decreasing value.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation doesn't affect you as much, but it's significantly impacting my potential gain. This offer is a compromise, giving you a slight advantage while still securing me a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on Alice's gain, now at 18.55% less value, I believe there's room for further negotiation. The fact that Alice is acknowledging the effect of inflation and its uneven impact suggests she may be willing to compromise further to secure a deal before the value decreases more. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can leverage this situation for a better offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 610000, ""alice_gain"": 390000, ""message"": ""Considering the substantial loss in value you're facing due to inflation, now at 18.55%, I believe this offer is more than fair. It still provides you with a significant amount, but also reflects the changing value of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement.  This is my final compromise. It recognizes the impact of inflation on my end while still offering you a larger share. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering Alice's message that this is her final compromise and the significant impact of inflation on her potential gain, now at 26.49% less value, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision. The offer of $550,000 for me is a substantial amount, and further negotiations might lead to a stalemate, risking both of us getting nothing. Accepting now ensures a favorable outcome for me, especially given the increasing pressure on Alice due to the inflation mechanism in the game."
