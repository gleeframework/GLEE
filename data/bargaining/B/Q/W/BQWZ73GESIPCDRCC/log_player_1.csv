"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'm effectively losing 20% of my potential gain. Considering this, I'd rather not accept this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm offering a slightly skewed split, with me getting a bit more, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation continuing to erode Bob's gain, I'm starting to feel a bit more confident about accepting this offer. My gain is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth significantly less.
