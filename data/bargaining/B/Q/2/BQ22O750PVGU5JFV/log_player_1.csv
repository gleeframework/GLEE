```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get the negotiation started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the ball rolling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I want the majority. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in this round, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to reject it. I'm not comfortable with taking only 20% of the money, especially since it's worth less than in the previous round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less in this round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, hoping to get a better deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be cautious and aim for a higher share to make up for the loss in value.

However, I'm not convinced that 30% is a good enough share, especially since Bob is still taking the majority. I'll have to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need a better deal to make up for inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, hoping to get a more favorable deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit impatient, so I'll give you a slightly smaller share. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a big toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not happy with the 25% share, especially since it's worth even less than in the previous rounds. With the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I need to be extremely cautious and aim for a much higher share to make up for the massive loss in value.

I'll have to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a very high share to compensate for the significant decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a big risk and propose a 60/40 split. It's now or never!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money drops even further."
