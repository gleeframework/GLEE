I'm taking a risk here, but I think it's better to secure a larger share early on, even if it means Bob might reject it. If he does, the money will be worth less in the next round. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take effect. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
