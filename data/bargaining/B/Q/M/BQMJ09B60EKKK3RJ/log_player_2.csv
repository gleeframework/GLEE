Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have thought of that before, I'm not settling for half now. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is facing a 73.79% reduction in value. This offer, while not ideal, is better than what he's likely to get in future rounds.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently rejected offers that were heavily in her favor. She seems set on getting more than half. 
* **Time Pressure:** Only 5 rounds remain. Continuing to reject offers increases the risk of walking away with nothing.

While getting less than half is not ideal, taking this offer cuts Bob's losses and avoids a total loss."
