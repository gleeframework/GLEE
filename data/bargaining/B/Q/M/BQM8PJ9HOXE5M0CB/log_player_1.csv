"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 with a 75/25 split. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I understand the value of the money decreases for me each round, I believe this split is still fair, considering I am taking the risk of the money losing value further if we continue. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
