Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value of money, I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures a balanced distribution for both of us, despite the inflationary effects. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
