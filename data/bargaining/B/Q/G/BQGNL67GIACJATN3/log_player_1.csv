"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20-80 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll try to negotiate.
