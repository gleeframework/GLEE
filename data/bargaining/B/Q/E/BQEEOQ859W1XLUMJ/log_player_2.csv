"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? This is my counter-offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need you to understand the impact of inflation on my end. This is my final offer for this round. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right to highlight the impact of inflation, her offer still heavily favors her. Accepting a 43/57 split at this stage would set a bad precedent for future rounds, where the value of my potential gains will decrease further. I need to push for a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to accept a slight disadvantage due to the inflation difference, but your previous offer wasn't sustainable. This is a strong offer that reflects the time pressure.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Acknowledging Inflation:** The message acknowledges Alice's concerns about inflation impacting her gains more slowly. 
- **Firm but Fair:** The offer is a significant increase for Bob from the previous round, signaling a willingness to compromise. However, it still leans slightly in his favor to account for the faster devaluation of his potential gains.
- **Time Pressure:** Emphasizing the dwindling number of rounds remaining adds urgency and encourages Alice to seriously consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time and the value is literally disappearing. This is a compromise - halfway between our last offers. Let's be logical and agree before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range, especially considering the significant inflation impacting my potential gains. Holding out for a better deal in later rounds carries a significant risk of getting nothing at all. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even with the accumulated inflation."
