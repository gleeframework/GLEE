7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Alice. This is fair considering the initial value and the potential inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think 2:1 is a more reasonable ratio, considering the potential inflation. Let's split it this way.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I propose a 5:1 ratio in favor of Alice. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for potential future value loss.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise further. 5:4 is a fair ratio considering the inflation, and it's closer to my initial proposal. Let's try this.",Bob,4,
