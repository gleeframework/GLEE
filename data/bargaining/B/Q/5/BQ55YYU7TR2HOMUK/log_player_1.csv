"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80:20 split, where I receive $800,000 and you receive $200,000. This ensures a fair distribution considering the inflation rate.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 90:10 split in my favor. This takes into account the inflation but also leaves you with something.  It's a fair offer, consider it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
