Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation eats our money! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer means getting even less of the original $100.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for Alice. It's unlikely he'll suddenly propose a better deal in Round 5.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk of ending up with an even worse deal, or nothing at all, in the next round.

Accepting the current offer cuts Alice's losses and ensures she gets something, even if it's not the optimal amount."
