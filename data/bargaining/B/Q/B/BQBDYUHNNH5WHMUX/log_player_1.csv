"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total, while I'll take $600,000. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a reasonable offer. If Bob declines, the value of the money will decrease, and he might end up with less in subsequent rounds. I'm hoping he'll see the sense in accepting this offer and ending the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer deal. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer of $450,000 for me and $550,000 for himself is not acceptable to me. Considering the inflation, the value of the money I gain has decreased significantly, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or force Bob to accept a less favorable offer due to the increasing devaluation of the money for him as well. I'll take my chances and propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the decreased value of the money for both of us. Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I need to adjust my offer accordingly.\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet halfway""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $480,000, which is slightly less than half, taking into account the inflation that affects us both but hits me harder. This offer is more generous than my initial one, considering the current devalued state of the money. I hope Bob recognizes the fairness in this offer and accepts it, ending the game before the value of the money drops further."
