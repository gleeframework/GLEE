"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, can't you? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: 30 = 30% of the current value (which is 80% of the initial $100, since it's worth 20% less)
Bob gain: 70 = 70% of the current value (which is 80% of the initial $100)

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50 this time!""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split, where I'll take 50% of the current value of the money, and Bob will take the remaining 50%."
