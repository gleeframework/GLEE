I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I have the advantage of the smaller inflation rate.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is less favorable to me than my initial proposal, even with inflation considered.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  I'm willing to give Bob a little more this round since he rejected my previous offer, but I still want to maintain a slight advantage."
