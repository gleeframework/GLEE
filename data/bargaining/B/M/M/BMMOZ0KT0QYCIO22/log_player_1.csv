Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the inflation rates will affect Bob more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer a larger share, this is a fair deal considering the inflation rates.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and the risk of continuing the game could lead to a worse outcome due to the inflation affecting both of us."
