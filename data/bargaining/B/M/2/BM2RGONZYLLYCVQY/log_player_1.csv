I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer to see how Bob reacts. I'm hoping he'll accept it, but I'm also willing to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair, and even though I'm losing value with each round, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.  While I'm still prioritizing getting a larger share, I'm acknowledging that Bob has some leverage now. I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to negotiate fairly."
