Let's start with a fair split. I propose we each take half."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try and get a slightly better deal for myself this time. I'll offer Bob $4500, hoping he'll accept since he's already tried to get more for himself in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a better deal than what I offered in the last round, and with the ongoing inflation, I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the next round.  Let's accept this offer."
