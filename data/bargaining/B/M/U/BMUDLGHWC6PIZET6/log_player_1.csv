"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'll still give you something. Maybe we can negotiate further? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. I'm not thrilled about the 80/20 split, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds with lower potential gains. I'll accept this offer for now.
