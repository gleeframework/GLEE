"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous amount considering the game's inflation rules. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

My gain: 50 / 0.8 = 62.5
Bob's gain: 50 / 0.9 = 55.56

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'm willing to accept Bob's 50/50 offer to move on to the next round. I'll just have to hope for better offers in the future!
