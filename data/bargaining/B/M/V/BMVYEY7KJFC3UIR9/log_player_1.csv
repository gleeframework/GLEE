Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% and take 80%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think a more even split is fair. I'm proposing we each take a little less than half. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation.

I'm not too thrilled about the reduced gain, but I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think of a new offer for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to keep a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
