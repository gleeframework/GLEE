"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it evenly for a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Since we're starting with a fair split, I'd like to test if Alice is willing to compromise further. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a counteroffer in the next round, potentially gaining more than an even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'd like a bit more than half. How about 55-45?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is a bit closer to an even split. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Alice's offer is less than the even split initially proposed. Since we've already established that I'm not willing to settle for an even split, accepting less would be inconsistent. I'll reject and try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet closer to the middle, 52.5-47.5?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this seems like a reasonable compromise.  It's closer to even, and we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: The offer is closer to the even split, and the difference is relatively small ($200). Considering the back-and-forth, this seems like a reasonable compromise. Continuing to reject might lead to further concessions from Alice, but it also risks her becoming less willing to compromise, potentially leading to a worse outcome. Accepting this offer provides a decent gain while ending the negotiation on a relatively positive note."
