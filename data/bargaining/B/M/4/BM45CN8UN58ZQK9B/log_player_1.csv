"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. I'm willing to give you a good chunk of the money. Accept and we can shake hands!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to let you take the whole pie. Make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 200,000$ I would gain is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually 190,000$ in ""real"" terms.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
