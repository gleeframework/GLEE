"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'd prefer a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's try a 42/58 split. 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger cut, Alice is being more reasonable this time around.  Taking the 58/42 split is better than risking another round of inflation."
