Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very unequal offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  It's risky, but I figure he'll rather get something than nothing if we keep going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing a significant portion due to inflation, it's better to accept this offer. If I reject it, I have to make an offer in the next round, and the money will be worth even less for me. It's a gamble, but I think it's the best option."
