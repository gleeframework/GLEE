Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right that inflation is hurting him more, he's overestimating his negotiating position.  Here's why:

* **My losses are accelerating:** Although my inflation rate is lower, it compounds. Rejecting this offer means I'm losing more value in the next round.
* **Bob's position is weakening:** Each round makes his potential gains significantly smaller. He needs a deal sooner than I do. 

I'll hold out for a slightly better offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it.  Inflation is eating away at both of our potential gains, and I'm willing to accept a smaller share now to end this.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a balance:** I need to offer something that seems like a concession on my part, while still securing a reasonable amount of the dwindling pot.
* **Sense of urgency:** My message emphasizes the time pressure to make Bob feel like this is his last chance for a decent deal.
* **Leaving room for acceptance:** While this is my ""final offer,"" I've left a small amount of wiggle room in case Bob counters with a slightly lower amount for me."
