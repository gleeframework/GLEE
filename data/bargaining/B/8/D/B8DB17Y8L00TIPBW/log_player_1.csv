  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and take 600k. Your turn!""

I'm starting with a fair split, offering Bob 400,000$."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: You're being too generous with the first offer. I'll take 70% of the money, but I'll give you a fair deal in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept this offer. It's a pretty bad deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken a bite out of the money, and it's now worth 64% of its original value. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

  ""bob_gain"": 520000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me as well! Given the inflation, the money is now worth 48.8% of its original value, and Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me.
