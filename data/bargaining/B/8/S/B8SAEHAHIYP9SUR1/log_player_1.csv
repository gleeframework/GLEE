"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward and easy way to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, fair and square. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $850,000
Bob gain: $850,000

I'm not sure I want to give Bob half of the remaining amount. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 600000, but I want 400000 for myself.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less again, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $807,500
Bob gain: $807,500

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I won't go lower. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less than the original $1,000,000, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $860,000
Bob gain: $360,000

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and having the money decrease in value even more. I'll accept Bob's offer.
