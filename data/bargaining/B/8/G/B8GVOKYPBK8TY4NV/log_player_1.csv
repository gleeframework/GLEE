"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving myself the majority of the money. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will see that taking something is better than risking getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
This is a fair split, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's better to take half than risk getting nothing."
