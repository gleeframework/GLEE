"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation""}\n\nI'll offer a division where I take 55 dollars and Bob takes 45 dollars. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a fair initial offer because I am affected more significantly by inflation. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases more substantially for me than for Bob, so starting with a slightly higher amount for myself seems reasonable to compensate for the higher devaluation I face. The message ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation"" aims to convey the reasoning behind my proposal, encouraging Bob to consider the impact of inflation on our shares over potential future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but this offer helps me more. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite acknowledging the harder impact of inflation on me, his proposal disproportionately favors him. Accepting 30 dollars, which is worth 20% less than in the first round, puts me at a significant disadvantage. Given the conditions, I believe a more balanced offer considering the inflation rates would be more acceptable. I'll proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer that better reflects the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, let's meet in the middle to account for the loss of value on both sides.""}\n\nIn this round, I propose a division where we both take 50 dollars. Given that the money's value has decreased for both of us, meeting in the middle seems like a fair compromise. My previous offer considered the higher inflation rate affecting me, but Bob's counteroffer was too skewed in his favor. By splitting the money equally, we both acknowledge the loss of value due to inflation without disproportionately benefiting one party over the other. This offer aims to find a balance and conclude the game fairly."
