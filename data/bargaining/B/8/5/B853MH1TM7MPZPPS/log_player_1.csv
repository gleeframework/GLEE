I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm starting with a large portion for myself since I know the money will be worth less in later rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is still a good outcome, especially considering the inflation factor. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
