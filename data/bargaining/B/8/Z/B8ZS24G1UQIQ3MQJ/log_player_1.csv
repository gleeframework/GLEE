"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, this offer is more appealing to me. I'll accept Bob's offer.
