"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take 60%, you get 40%.  It's a fair starting point for us both. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less, so I'd only get $4,800 if I accepted this offer.

I'm not comfortable with the 60-40 split, especially since I was initially offered a 60-40 split and rejected it. I'd like to counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll counter with a 55-45 split, can you accept?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll stick with the 55-45 split, it's a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm sticking with the 55-45 split, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500."
