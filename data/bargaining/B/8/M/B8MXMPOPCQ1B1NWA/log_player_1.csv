"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a good starting point, and since the money devalues faster for Bob, it's a pretty good deal for him in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's less than my initial offer, the money is worth less in each round.  Accepting this deal is the best way to ensure I get something."
