Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but time is working against me more than her.  I need to show I'm willing to negotiate but not be pushed around.  Rejecting this keeps the pressure on, and I'll likely have to concede more in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and guarantees we both walk away with a significant sum.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

By round 6, the impact of inflation is significant.  Offering a 50/50 split:

* **Projects strength:**  I'm not desperate yet.
* **Is simple and fair:** Hard for Alice to argue against logically.
* **Creates urgency:**  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for BOTH of us, but especially me.

It's a gamble, but given Alice's stubbornness, a strong stance now might be the best way to secure a decent payout before inflation eats further into my potential gains."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really feeling the pinch of inflation now, aren't you? 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation disadvantage, and it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject her offers.  

Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Every round sees a significant chunk of my potential earnings disappear.  
* **Alice's Strategy:**  She's unlikely to budge much given her previous offers. Waiting for a drastically better deal is highly improbable.
* **Something is better than nothing:**  Holding out for too long risks ending up with nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement in 12 rounds. 

Accepting now cuts my losses and guarantees a decent sum."
