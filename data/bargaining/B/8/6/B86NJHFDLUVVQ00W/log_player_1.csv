"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. Fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's really taking a risk here! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Bob. So, the actual amounts are:

My gain: $6,000 (same as in round 1)
Bob's gain: $6,400 (80% of $8,000)

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I think I'll have to consider it. I'd rather not risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less for me. I'll accept Bob's offer.
