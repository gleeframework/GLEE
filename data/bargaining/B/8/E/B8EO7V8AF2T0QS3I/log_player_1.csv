"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This seems fair given Bob's money is devalued much faster than mine, and we have a lot of rounds to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to try a slightly more aggressive approach.  Since Bob is losing value much faster, I'll offer him 20% and keep 80% for myself.  This seems like a reasonable compromise considering his previous offer was extremely unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still extremely unbalanced, and while his money is losing value faster, mine is still being devalued too.  I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob 30% and keep 70% for myself. While Bob is losing value much faster, we're both losing money with each round.  This offer gives him a better share than previous rounds while still being relatively favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still very unbalanced, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  While his money is depreciating quickly, so is mine, and I'm confident I can secure a more equitable split if we continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time, offering Bob 40% and keeping 60% for myself.  With each passing round, the devaluation is becoming more significant for both of us, so finding a middle ground seems essential."
