"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% of the money, but I think it's a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm effectively getting $200,000, which is 20% of the current $1,000,000. This seems like a reasonable offer, but I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less for me now (20% less in the first round and another 20% less in the second round), I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Let's try to finalize this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $700,000, which is 70% of the current $1,000,000, and I'll take the remaining $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think it's still a good compromise. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me now (20% less in the first round, 20% less in the second round, and another 8.8% less in the third round), I'm effectively getting $100,000, which is 10% of the current $1,000,000. This is a very low offer, and I'm not sure if I should accept it.

However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's a good compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
