Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting any longer will result in a smaller overall pot for both of us.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is unlikely to offer me a significantly better deal in subsequent rounds. His offer in Round 4 is already closer to an even split, and the decreasing value of the money makes further concessions less impactful for him.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks ending up with an even worse deal in a later round, or even reaching a point where the money's value is negligible.

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting 580,000$ now is better than gambling on a potentially worse outcome later."
