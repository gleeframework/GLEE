Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split, and the value diminishes rapidly for me with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategic move at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns for Bob:**  Inflation is severely impacting Bob.  His potential gain is decreasing rapidly each round, making him more likely to settle.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If we reject this offer and propose a more favorable one in Round 5, there's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might be desperate enough to gamble on a final round, even with a significantly reduced payout. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum of $450,000. Rejecting the offer brings uncertainty and the potential for an even worse outcome in later rounds."
