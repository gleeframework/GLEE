Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I've tried to find a balance that acknowledges your higher loss but also reflects the decreasing value for me. This division gives us both a significant amount, with a slight adjustment for the inflation disparity. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
