Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit more, but 57-43 is my new limit.

# Alice gain: 5700

``` 
It's better to take what I can get at this point. The inflation is hitting hard, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer in the next round."
