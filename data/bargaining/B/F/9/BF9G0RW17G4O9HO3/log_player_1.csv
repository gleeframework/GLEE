"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going easy on you yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 * 0.9 = 3600
* Bob gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 200 from the previous round, and leaving the door open for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet! I think I deserve more than that. You're getting a better deal than you think. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000 * 0.727 = 2187
* Bob gain: 7000 * 0.727 = 5081

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than that.
