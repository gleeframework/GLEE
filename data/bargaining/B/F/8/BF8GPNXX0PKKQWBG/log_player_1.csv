Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the smaller share this round, but I think it's a fair compromise given the inflation rate. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
