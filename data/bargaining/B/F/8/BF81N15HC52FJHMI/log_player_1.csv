"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of the money 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to propose my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than his previous offer, but still leaves him with a significant portion of the money."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
