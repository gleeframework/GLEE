"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm taking a bit more, but you get a good chunk too. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to take the offer, it's better to see what Alice's next offer is.  Bob has 12 rounds, so he has time to wait and see if he can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  We both get a fair share, and we can move on to bigger and better things.""}
