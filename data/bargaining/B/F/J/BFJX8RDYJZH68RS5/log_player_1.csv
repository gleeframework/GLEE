"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. Accept this and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm trying to make a good first impression and show that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: $500,000 (which is 5% less than the $525,000 I could have gotten in the previous round)
* Bob gain: $500,000

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is proposing an even split, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
