Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a fair split that saves us both time and potential losses due to inflation.  Agreeing now is the most rational choice. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
