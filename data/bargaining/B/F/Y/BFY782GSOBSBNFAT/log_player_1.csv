"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This means I'm offering to take 70 dollars, and Bob would get 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll get if I accept this offer:

Alice gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48
Bob gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32

I'll accept this offer.
