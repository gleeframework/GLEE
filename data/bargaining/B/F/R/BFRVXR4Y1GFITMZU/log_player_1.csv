"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to take the majority of the money, but I'm offering Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation rate means that accepting this offer is the better choice. If I reject, I'll have to offer a better split in the next round, and I'll be facing even higher inflation.  It's best to take what I can get."
