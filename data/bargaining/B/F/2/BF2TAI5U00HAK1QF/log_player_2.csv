Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean settling for less than what I offered Alice in the previous round, even though the value of the money is decreasing faster for her. It's a gamble, but I think I can still negotiate a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is plummeting. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it - we're running out of time!"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game is at a critical point.  

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share, but her negotiating position weakens with each passing round.
* **Fairness as Leverage:** A 50/50 split is demonstrably fair. It removes any argument of greed and emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement before inflation eats away at the entire sum. 

This offer presents a strong, clear, and final proposition to force a decision from Alice."
