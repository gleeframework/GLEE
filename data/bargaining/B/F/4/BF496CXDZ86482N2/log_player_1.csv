"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  This ensures a better outcome for both of us than the previous offer, given the coming inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
