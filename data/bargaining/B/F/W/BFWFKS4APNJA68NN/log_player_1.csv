"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too much, let's just split it 50/50.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $3200.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
