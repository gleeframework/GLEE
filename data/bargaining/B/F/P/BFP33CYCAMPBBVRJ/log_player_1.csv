"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, I'm taking a firmer stance. Meet me in the middle or we'll both lose out!""

# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a last-ditch effort to negotiate a deal. Considering the inflation, Bob's share is worth even less than before, and I'm not sure if I want to settle for a 70% share when I know I can do better.
