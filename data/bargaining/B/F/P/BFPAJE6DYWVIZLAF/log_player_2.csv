"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, let's split it 90/10.  I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 10% cut of a million dollars. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. I'll take 95% and you can have the remaining 5%. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation we've seen. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and while I'd prefer more, it's better to accept a 40% cut than risk getting nothing."
