"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 70/30 split. Let's try a more balanced approach. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think a 30:70 split is a good deal for me, especially after the first round was rejected. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","After Bob's offer, I'll try to propose a more balanced split. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
