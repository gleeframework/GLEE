"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a bit more since the inflation hits you harder. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to see if I can get a better deal.  The inflation will hurt me more, but I'm willing to gamble on getting a larger share later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it more evenly, but I need a larger share to offset the inflation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, so we need to compromise to get anything. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Inflation is hurting me significantly, and a 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances.  I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing."
