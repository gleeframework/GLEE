Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money closer to 60/40.  Let's get this done before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
