"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I get $650,000 and you get $350,000.  This gives us both a good chunk of the money.  Remember, inflation hurts us both as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the inflation. This offer gets us closer to a 50/50 split while still acknowledging the shrinking pot. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
