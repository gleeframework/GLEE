Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're going to play tough.  This is my final offer - a straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but any more rounds and I'm getting pennies on the dollar. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I'll take the 50/50 split. With the value of money decreasing rapidly for Alice, I don't think I can get a better offer than this. It's better to secure the 50% now rather than risking further negotiations."
