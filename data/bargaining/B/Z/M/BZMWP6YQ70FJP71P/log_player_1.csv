"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I don't want to give up 60, but I also don't want to walk away from 40. Considering the inflation, I'll have to think about the future value of the money.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, it's a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, taking a slightly larger share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, it's a slight compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous. The money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is significantly less due to the inflation. I'm not sure if I can do better than this offer.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
