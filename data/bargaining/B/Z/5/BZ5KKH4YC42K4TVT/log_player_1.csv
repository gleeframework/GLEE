"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation rates. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, Bob's offer of a 55/45 split is a bit more favorable to him than my initial offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rates in mind, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's see if you'll accept this offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage for myself."
