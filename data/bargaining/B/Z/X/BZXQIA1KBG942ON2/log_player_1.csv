"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to Round 2!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more equitable. This offer reflects a better balance, and we can end this game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 5% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share of the money, but I also don't want to risk going to Round 3 and facing even more inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I need to be even more careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, which is a 55-45 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game!"
