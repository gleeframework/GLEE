"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, there's no reason to accept it immediately. As Bob, I want to maximize my potential gains.  By rejecting, I can force Alice to propose a better deal in the next round, potentially getting a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be a little more equitable. This offer reflects a better balance, and we can end this game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like to get more, Alice's offer is closer to my initial goal, and the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting ensures I get a significant share and avoids the risk of getting less in later rounds due to further inflation."
