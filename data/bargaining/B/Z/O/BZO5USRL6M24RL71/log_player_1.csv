Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, considering I'm losing value faster 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on with inflation increasing, accepting this offer would mean I get less than in round 2.  It's clear Bob is feeling the inflation pinch more, so I'll hold out for a slightly better deal, hoping he'll become more agreeable in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  The inflation makes it pointless to drag this on any longer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping he'll realize accepting a less favorable deal now is better than risking a worse outcome in a potential round 6, where the money will have devalued even further for him."
