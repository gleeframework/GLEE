Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  The inflation makes it pointless to drag this on any longer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### I will accept this offer since the inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money I gain, and further rounds will only decrease its value more. Accepting 4000 now is more beneficial than risking another round with potentially less value."
