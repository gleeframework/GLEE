"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to get this done quickly. Let's see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial proposal. It's not worth it to accept this. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still offering a decent share to Bob. Hopefully, he'll see the value in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation. I'm not going to settle for such a low share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable share.  I'm offering Bob a bit more this time, but I'm still keeping a majority of the money. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough for me.  I'm losing a lot of money to inflation, but I'm determined to get a better deal.  I'll try to negotiate a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm hoping that the increasing inflation will make this offer more attractive to Bob. He's losing more money with each passing round, and it's becoming more and more likely that we'll both end up with nothing if we don't come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the substantial inflation, Bob's offer is still not acceptable. I'm losing too much money to his greed. We're getting closer to the deadline, and I'm worried we might both end up with nothing. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

We're getting dangerously close to the deadline.  I'm taking a big risk here, but I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the money in the hopes of reaching a compromise.  He's losing a lot more to inflation than I am, and I'm hoping this will make him realize that it's better to settle than to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. I'm losing more and more with each passing round, but I'm still not willing to accept such a low share.  We're running out of time, but I'm determined to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to take a smaller share than I originally wanted, but I'm not going to settle for anything less. It's a gamble, but I believe Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a terrible offer, but it's better than nothing. I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, but I'm accepting it to avoid the worst-case scenario of getting nothing at all. I should have been more willing to compromise earlier."
