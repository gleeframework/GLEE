"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the $10,000 and leave Bob with $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $9,000 from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $7,200. I don't want to leave that much on the table.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
