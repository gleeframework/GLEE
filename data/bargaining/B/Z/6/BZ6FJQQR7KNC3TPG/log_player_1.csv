"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

This offer is worth 8000 dollars for me now, but it will be worth 6400 dollars after the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we can both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of 5000 dollars is actually worth 4000 dollars to me.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is the best deal for me. I'll pass for now and try to negotiate a better split in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, the total amount is now worth 80% of its original value, which is 8000 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'll take 60% this time, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a bigger share, but let's find a compromise. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share this time. How about 4500 for me and 5500 for you? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the total amount is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately 5136 dollars.

However, considering the offer, I'll calculate the value of the offer in the current round. The offer is 5500 dollars for me and 4500 dollars for Bob. This is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
