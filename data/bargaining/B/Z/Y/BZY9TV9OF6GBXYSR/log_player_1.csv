I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start. Hopefully, he'll be tempted to take it, but if not, I'll have the advantage in the next round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very greedy! I'm going to reject this offer. I can do better, especially since the money is losing value so fast."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a bit more than last round.  Since the money is depreciating, I need to get him to accept quickly.  I think this might be enough to entice him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being unreasonable. I'm going to keep rejecting these offers.  The inflation is hitting him harder than it is me, and I think he'll eventually be forced to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob again. The inflation is starting to hit me harder, but I still have a slight advantage, and I need to get this done before we lose too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn, but I'm holding firm. I'm not going to give in to his demands just because he's been stubborn this long.  The inflation is getting worse, but I think he's feeling it even more than I am.  He'll come around."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, even though the inflation is hitting me hard now. Bob's stubbornness is starting to backfire on him. I'm hoping this offer is finally enticing enough to get him to agree."
