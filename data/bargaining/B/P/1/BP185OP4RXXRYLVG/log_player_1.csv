"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's see if Bob agrees!""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20:80 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""A compromise, let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a 40:60 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is really losing its value quickly! With the 48.8% reduction, I'm not thrilled about the 10:90 split. However, I don't want to risk getting stuck with even less if I reject this offer and Bob makes an even worse proposal in the next round.
