"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk to keep the game going!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground, I'll give you a fair share if you meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd be getting $6,400 in this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $5,000, which is worth 80% of $6,250 (the original value of $5,000 before inflation). That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my $6,400 is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd be getting $5,120 in this round.

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"

Round 4

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $5,120 is now worth 40.8% of its original value, so I'd be getting $2,092.80 in this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $4,000, which is worth 40% of $10,000 (the original value of $10,000 before inflation). That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.
