"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise given the reduced value of the money."
