Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, but your offer is too lopsided. Let's compromise: I'll take 70% and you get 30%. We still have time to work out a better deal if this doesn't suit you.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to go down to 60% if you're willing to meet me halfway. Let's not let our stubbornness cost us more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid inflation working against her.  I need to push for a more significant advantage in the next round or two before the diminishing returns make it pointless."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  The inflation is working against you more than me.  Let's be reasonable and split this fairly while it's still worthwhile.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show flexibility but holding firm closer to a 50/50 split.  The message is crucial here, emphasizing the impact of inflation on Alice's potential gains. I need to convince her to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer! I'm dropping down to 55%, but I need you to meet me halfway on this.  The longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky now.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at 55/45 guarantees a reasonable amount of money. If I reject and continue to push for a larger share, I risk Alice becoming more stubborn, and the shrinking pot due to inflation might leave us with an even worse outcome in the end.  It's better to secure a decent win now than risk losing a significant portion of the money in the remaining rounds."
