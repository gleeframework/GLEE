Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a decent amount even with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Even with the slight inflation hit, accepting a 50/50 split in the second round is the best move. Here's why:

* **Fairness:** Bob's offer is objectively fair.  
* **Avoiding Further Losses:** If I reject, I'll be making an offer in Round 3 where the money is worth even less.  There's no guarantee I can negotiate a better outcome at that point, and Bob is likely aware of that. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now secures a reasonable amount. Continuing the game introduces more risk and potential for lower gains."
