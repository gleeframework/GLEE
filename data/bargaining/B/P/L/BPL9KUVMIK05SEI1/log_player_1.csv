"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the uneven split, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a more equal share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, while still keeping the split relatively close to 50/50."
