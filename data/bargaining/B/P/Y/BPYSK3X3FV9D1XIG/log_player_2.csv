Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Initiative:** By taking the second-round offer, I establish myself as a serious player and set the tone for further negotiations.
* **Strategic Advantage:** Alice's money is devaluing faster than mine. Delaying works in my favor as her urgency to secure a deal increases.
* **Finality:**  By stating ""This is my final offer,"" I convey a sense of decisiveness. This might push Alice to accept a less favorable deal in this round rather than risk getting a worse offer later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than you offered 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Trend:** Alice is reducing her demand, indicating my strategy of patience is working.
* **Still Favorable:** While closer to even, the offer still gives Alice a significantly larger share. Her need is greater than mine at this point.
* **Inflation Advantage:**  Each round makes the deal worse for Alice. I'm willing to wait for an offer closer to, or even exceeding, a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Time is money Alice, and it's depreciating faster for you.  Let's be practical.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting the Balance:** I'm pushing closer to an even split, maintaining pressure on Alice. 
* **Highlighting Urgency:**  My message directly reminds Alice of the time pressure and its impact on her potential gains.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering slightly more than her last offer to me (42) might make this offer more palatable while still being advantageous to me."
