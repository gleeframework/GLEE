"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the majority 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 60-40 split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""I'm still looking for a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think this is as good as it gets 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly for me. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to make a more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less than in the previous round, I'll have to be even more careful with my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm still looking for a better deal, but I'm willing to accept a compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
