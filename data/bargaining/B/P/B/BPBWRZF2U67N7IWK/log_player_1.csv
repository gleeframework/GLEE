"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's a good deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, considering that the money will be worth less for him in the next round. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game here.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 45-55 is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob each round, he'll be more motivated to make a better offer as the game goes on. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer and it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's do 58-42.""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, but I'm still trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for Bob with each passing round. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game here.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 48-52 is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I still think I can get a better deal. The money is worth even less for Bob now, so he should be more motivated to make a better offer. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer and it's my turn again!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Considering the inflation, 57-43 is a good deal for you.""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer than my previous one, but I'm still trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for Bob with each passing round. Since the inflation is starting to add up, Bob might be more willing to accept a deal that's slightly less favorable to him. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game here.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response!"
