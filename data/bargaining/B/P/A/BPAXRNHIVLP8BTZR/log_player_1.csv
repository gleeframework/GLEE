"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since my gain of $8,000 in the first round is still worth the same, but Bob's gain of $2,000 is now worth 5% less, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject the offer.

Let's calculate the adjusted values:

My gain: $8,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $2,000 x 0.95 (5% less) = $1,900

Considering the adjusted values, I'll reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with $3,000."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was $5,000 for me and $5,000 for him, and I rejected it, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself this time.

However, I'll take into account that Bob's offer was 50/50, which is a relatively fair split. Considering the inflation and the previous rejections, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
