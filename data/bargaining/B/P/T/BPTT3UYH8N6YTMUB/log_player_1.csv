"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to think carefully. Since the offer is for $300,000 for me, which is worth 60% of the original $600,000 I offered in the first round, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 60% of its original value, I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Given the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 45% of the original $600,000 I offered in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the offer is the same as in round 2, I'll reject it again.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 620000,
