"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer.

}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the previous offers and the inflation, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly higher share, but still being reasonable given the inflation."
