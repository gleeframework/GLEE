"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my calculations to account for the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, and I was initially offered $4000, I'll calculate my gain as 4000 / 0.8 = 5000.

The offer from Bob is 4000 for me and 6000 for him, which is a 40-60 split. I'll accept this offer.
