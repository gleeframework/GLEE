"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 6:4 split is a fair compromise. It's closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives you a larger share. Let's see if we can come to an agreement in this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
