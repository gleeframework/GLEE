Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:** While the time pressure is on, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is not ideal. It's likely Alice is feeling the pressure too and might be willing to make a larger concession in the next round."
