"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

After calculating the actual amounts I'll receive, I get:

* My gain: $3000 * 0.95 (5% less due to inflation) = $2850
* Bob's gain: $7000 * 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = $5600

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal.

Considering the continued inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round. So, the effective value of the money is now 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm offering you $5,800, and I'll take $4,200."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll receive, considering the inflation:

* My gain: $4500 * 0.85 (14.26% less due to inflation) = $3825
* Bob's gain: $5500 * 0.516 (48.8% less due to inflation) = $2832

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not.
