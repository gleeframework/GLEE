Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a fairer split. Since the money is worth less each round, let's be reasonable and split it closer to 50/50. Take $45 and we'll be done with this! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
