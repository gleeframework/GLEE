"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'll have to decide whether this is a good deal for me.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll think about Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll have to decide whether this is a good deal for me.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
