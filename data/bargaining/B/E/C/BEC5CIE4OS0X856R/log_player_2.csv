"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 90/10 split. You get the smaller share this time, but remember, the value of your money decreases less than mine with each round.

""bob_gain"": 6000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much. I'm offering a 70/30 split.  This is the last time I'll make a proposal that's in your favor - next time, it's all about maximizing my own share. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a tough game, but she's showing signs of compromise. While a 70/30 split in her favor isn't ideal, her threat to maximize her share in future rounds has weight. I'm betting she'll be more open to a favorable deal for me in the next round when it's her turn to face losses."

Round 4

""message"": ""Last chance for a deal like this, Alice.  55/45 is my final offer.  The clock is ticking, and soon those losses will start impacting you too."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my guns. The value of your offer is decreasing faster than mine, so it's only fair to maximize my own share now.  This is my final offer - 80/20. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has shifted.  Alice is now playing hardball, and my bargaining power is eroding rapidly due to inflation. Accepting her 80/20 offer, while far from ideal, is better than walking away with nothing if the rounds run out."
