Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I think a fair split is important. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
