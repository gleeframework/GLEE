I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  Let's see if he's feeling generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round.  The inflation is getting out of hand!"
