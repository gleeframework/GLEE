Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the clock is ticking, accepting an offer below my initial split is not a good strategy.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away."
