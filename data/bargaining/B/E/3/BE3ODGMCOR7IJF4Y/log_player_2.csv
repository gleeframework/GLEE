Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer, accepting this offer would still mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain due to inflation. It's worth risking another round to see if we can get closer to a 50/50 split or even a slight advantage."
