Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split accounts for the money's decreasing value over time. It's a fair offer.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be higher 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's crucial we settle now as the money is rapidly losing value for me.  This ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains. While Alice's offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking an even lower offer in the next round, where the value for Bob will plummet to less than 40% of the initial amount. 

It's a difficult decision, but accepting now ensures Bob at least receives something substantial rather than gambling on a potentially worse outcome in the next round."
