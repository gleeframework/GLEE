"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm aiming for the most money possible in the first round, knowing the money will depreciate for me. It's a gamble, but if Bob rejects, I'll have a chance to renegotiate with a more favorable inflation rate in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8800 
# Bob gain: 1200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. Inflation is working against me, and Bob's offer is still quite favorable. Rejecting it risks getting nothing at all in the final round."
