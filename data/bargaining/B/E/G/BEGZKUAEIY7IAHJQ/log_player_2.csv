"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but not too generous, offer.  I'm willing to give you a small share to get things rolling. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's a ridiculously low offer. I'm proposing a more reasonable split that reflects the fact that I'm losing money to inflation with every passing round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic, Bob.  We both lose money with every round.  This is a much fairer split than your last offer, and I believe we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  We need to push for a more equitable split, knowing that time is working against us due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be a fair deal.  My offer reflects the time pressure from inflation.  Let's close this out and avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's split it evenly and avoid any further losses.  It's the most sensible solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  The longer this drags on, the more I lose to inflation. A guaranteed $500,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
