"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, Alice. I'll take 6000 and leave you with 4000.  It's your turn to decide if we play again. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'd like to make a new offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
