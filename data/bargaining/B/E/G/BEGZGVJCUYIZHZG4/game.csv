4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. I'm lowering my ask slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but this deal still accounts for the faster inflation hitting my share.",Bob,4,

5600.0,4400.0,"I see you're willing to negotiate, but I still think my share should be higher. Inflation is hitting me too, you know!",Alice,5,

4900.0,5100.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money by being stubborn.  I'm proposing a near-even split to get this settled. You're getting a slightly better deal considering the long-term inflation difference. Let's be reasonable and end this.",Bob,6,
