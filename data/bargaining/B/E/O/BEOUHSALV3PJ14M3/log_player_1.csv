"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself. It's a good starting point for negotiations.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split, as I believe fairness should be our guiding principle in this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $700,000 is now worth only 80% of its original value, so I'd actually gain $560,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'd rather not accept a 50/50 split, as I'd be giving up $140,000 more than I would have in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim to maximize my gain. I'll propose a higher share for myself, but still leave some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000. It's a fair offer, considering the inflation.""
