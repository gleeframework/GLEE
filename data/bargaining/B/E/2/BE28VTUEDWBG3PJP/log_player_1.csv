"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This way, I maximize my share while still leaving a small amount for Bob, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, the inflation rate makes this a good deal for me. In the next round, I would only receive 80% of the $900,000 I was initially offered, which is less than $500,000.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a larger share."
