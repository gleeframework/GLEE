# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While the offer is getting slightly better, I need to show her I'm serious about getting a reasonable share.  The risk of getting nothing is increasing, but it's not time to panic yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on.  I'm offering a slight concession to entice Alice, but making it clear this is my bottom line.  This balances getting a decent share with the increasing risk of walking away with nothing as time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the clock is really working against me now. Accepting a 44/56 split is far from ideal, but it's better than risking a worse offer in a later round or even walking away with nothing. Alice knows I'm feeling the pressure, and it's unlikely she'll budge much further.  It's time to cut my losses and secure something."
