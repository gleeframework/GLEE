"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous starting offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'll accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the original amount. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal. It's my turn now!"

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair split considering the inflation.""

```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant portion for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this offer is significantly better than my previous one, and I'm still getting a smaller share than I'd like. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal. It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting intense!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting close to the endgame. I'm not getting a majority share, but I'm getting a decent amount, and it's better than going into further rounds. Let's call it a day!"
