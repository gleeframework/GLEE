I'm Bob, and I'm greedy!  I want more than $4,000. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take the bigger share this time.  Let's call it even.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fair deal. The longer we wait, the less you'll actually get. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, I'm taking the offer.  I don't want to risk another round of inflation."
