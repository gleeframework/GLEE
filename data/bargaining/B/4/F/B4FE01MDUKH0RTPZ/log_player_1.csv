"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split, a fair and balanced division of the funds, considering the initial offer was too skewed in your favor. I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
