"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000.  A fair starting point, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm happy to split the money more evenly. How about 5500 for me and 4500 for you? This way we both get a good starting point, and we can avoid the inflation eating away at our gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's still a bit too skewed towards you.  Let's be realistic - I'm offering $5,800 for me, $4,200 for you.  This deal gets worse for both of us the longer we wait. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
