"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share but you get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
