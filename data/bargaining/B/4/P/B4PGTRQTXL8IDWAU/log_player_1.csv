"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. Since the money loses value over time, especially more so for Bob, I believe this is a reasonable starting offer. If Bob declines, the next offer will be made with reduced value due to inflation, which affects Bob more than me. This initial offer aims to strike a balance, giving Bob a substantial amount while also considering the impact of inflation on future offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, the split seems overly favorable to Bob. Given that the money loses more value for Bob than for me with each passing round, I believe there's room for a more balanced offer. By rejecting this proposal, I aim to either get a better split in the next round or make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us, especially the greater loss of value for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both our potential gains, I've adjusted my offer to reflect a slightly more even split, while still acknowledging the greater loss of value on Bob's end. This offer aims to be more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money, especially for him. By offering a bit more than in the previous round, I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on, taking into account the effects of inflation."
