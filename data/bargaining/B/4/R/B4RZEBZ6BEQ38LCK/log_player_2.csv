"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. This way we both benefit from splitting the money early.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but still favors you too much considering the inflation. I'm proposing $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. This is a good deal considering the money will be worth even less if we wait longer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, aiming for a larger share while the value diminishes. While her offer seems tempting, it's important to hold strong for a better split. Accepting now sets a bad precedent for future rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast.  My last offer was already generous considering the inflation. I'm adjusting it slightly to 52/48, which is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the money is worth less. Bob needs to apply pressure to get Alice to settle.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 52/48 shows a willingness to negotiate but still maintains an advantage for Bob. 
* **Finality:**  Stating ""final offer"" adds weight to the proposal and signals that Bob is serious about reaching an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with each round. I'm offering you $4,400 which is more than you would have gotten last round if you factor in the inflation. Take the deal, or we both lose!  
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer in Round 5 is now the better option for Bob, even with the significant inflation. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is hitting both players hard. Rejecting this offer and hoping for even a 50/50 split in later rounds might result in Bob receiving even less value than Alice is currently offering.
* **Alice's Tone:** Alice's message indicates increasing frustration and a desire to end the negotiation. Pushing further could make her less willing to negotiate fairly in the future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from continuing to negotiate is now outweighed by the increasing risk of walking away with nothing if the rounds run out. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting minimizes the losses from inflation and secures Bob a reasonable sum."
