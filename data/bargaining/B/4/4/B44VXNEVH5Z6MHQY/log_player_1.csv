Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and simple!""
}
```

# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair.  Let's make this quick and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a 60-40 split in his favor. Since I'm not getting a better deal than my initial offer, I'll reject this proposal.
