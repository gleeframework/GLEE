"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob gets to take a majority of the money, and I only get a small consolation prize. I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll wait for a better proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better than the previous one. I'm still getting a smaller share than I was initially proposing, and I'm not willing to settle for $4,000 when I was hoping for $6,000. I'll wait for a better offer."

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out, and I'm willing to accept a slightly larger share than before. $5,500 is a decent compromise, and I think it's a fair deal considering the circumstances. I'll take this offer and hope that Bob will stick to his word."
