"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer. I'm hoping to secure a large share of the money early on, before inflation significantly diminishes the value of my share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can do better in the next round.  Even though the value of the money is decreasing, I still have plenty of rounds to secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to try a middle ground approach this time. I'll offer Bob a larger share than before, but still keep a decent amount for myself.  I believe a compromise is necessary to avoid further rejections.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in securing a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still going to reject it. This is getting risky. If I keep rejecting, I'm going to lose more and more money due to inflation. I need to start making some compromises, but I'm not going to settle for such a low share just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair compromise, and with the inflation increasing, it might be the best deal I can get at this point. I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of a secure deal rather than risking further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible, but I'm starting to get worried. Inflation is taking a serious bite out of my potential gains. I need to find a way to secure a deal, but I'm not going to give in to such a lopsided offer yet. I'll try to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share again. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and I need to make a deal soon.  I'm hoping that by offering a more favorable deal, I can convince Bob to accept and avoid losing even more money in the following rounds."
