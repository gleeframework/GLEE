"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good chance for Bob to get a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering your offer in the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds.
