"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be equal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like a fair split, and I'm willing to meet him halfway."
