Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than half 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering slightly more than the first round, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. With inflation eating into the potential gains, I need to push for a more equitable split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is a compromise to account for the shrinking pot. Let's be sensible and end this.""}"

# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  The pot is shrinking rapidly, and while Alice is moving closer to a fair split, it's still not enough.  I need to hold firm and hope she gets more reasonable before we both lose out."
