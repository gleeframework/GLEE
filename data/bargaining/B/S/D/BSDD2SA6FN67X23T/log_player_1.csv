"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly.""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with the message ""Let's divide fairly."" This division seems reasonable and might appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, encouraging him to accept the offer and end the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation on my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair division. This is better for you than waiting longer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems more favorable to me than waiting longer due to inflation, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I'll have the opportunity to propose a new division in the next round that could potentially be more beneficial to me, despite the continued impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Counteroffer for a fairer split.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll propose a division where I receive $5800 and Bob receives $4200, with the message ""Counteroffer for a fairer split."" This offer acknowledges Bob's previous proposal but adjusts the amounts slightly in my favor, hoping that Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise and accept it to end the game before further inflation affects my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a very fair offer considering the time pressure.  Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","I will accept Bob's offer. Given the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of my potential gain by 27.1% since the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The difference between our gains is relatively small, and the risk of further devaluation of my share outweighs the potential benefits of continued negotiation. By accepting now, I secure a gain that, although less than initially hoped, is still substantial and not subject to further erosion by inflation.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
