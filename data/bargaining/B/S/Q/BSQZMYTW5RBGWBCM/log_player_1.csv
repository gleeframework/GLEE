"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, a fair starting point. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money and leave 20% for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced split, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factored in, Bob's offer is a bit more appealing. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of $6,000 for me and $4,000 for him. It's a more balanced split, and I'm willing to settle for it."
