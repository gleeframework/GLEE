"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $50 each. This way, we can both get a decent amount of money and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I'm hoping to get more later 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's money being worth 5% less, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

However, since Bob is offering me a relatively small amount, I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting less. I'll have to think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being somewhat generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting Bob hard! With Bob's money being worth 14.26% less, I'm starting to think he's getting desperate. I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

Considering the inflation rate, Bob's offer is actually a 30/70 split, which is a pretty big difference from the previous rounds. I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more to Bob, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and getting an even worse deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the increasing inflation rate and Bob's growing desperation. Since Bob's money is worth less and less with each passing round, I'll try to take advantage of that.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35/65 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being somewhat generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, Alice, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really hitting Bob hard now! With his money being worth 22.62% less, I'm starting to think he's really struggling. However, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and getting an even worse deal.

Considering the offer, I'm looking at a 20/80 split, which is a pretty significant difference. I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more to Bob, but I also don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less.

However, I'm also thinking that Bob might be getting close to his limit, and if I reject this offer, he might not be able to make a better one in the next round. So, I'll take a chance...
