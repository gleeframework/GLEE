"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game, where the proposer (Alice in this case) has a strong incentive to offer the smallest possible amount to the responder (Bob).  While it seems unfair, the logic is that Bob has to accept even a tiny amount to get anything at all, as rejecting the offer means getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
