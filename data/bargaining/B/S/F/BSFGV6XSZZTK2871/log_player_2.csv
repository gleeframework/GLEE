"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept a seemingly ""fair"" split, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Bob's money is worth 20% less with each round. Holding out for a better deal in the next round is strategically advantageous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 20/80 split. This offer gives us a more even distribution, and we both still get a good share of the money.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
