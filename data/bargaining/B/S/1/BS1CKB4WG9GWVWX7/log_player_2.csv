{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm getting impatient with this game. While Alice is losing nothing due to inflation, my share is getting smaller with every round.  I'm going to try to push for a better deal again."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

While this deal is still not great, my share keeps decreasing with each round.  It's better to take what I can get at this point, rather than risk getting nothing at all."
