Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I understand your desire for a fair balance, I believe this split better reflects the value of money decreasing faster for me in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
