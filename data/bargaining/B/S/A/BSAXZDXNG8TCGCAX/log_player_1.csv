"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm also including a message to try to negotiate a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but not all 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by the inflation. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was hoping for a more equal split. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
