"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the higher inflation rate you face, I'm offering you a slightly larger share to incentivize an early agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems generous at first, it's important to consider the inflation rates. Even though I get a larger share initially, the value of that money will depreciate much faster than Alice's share. It's better to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but considering the inflation rate differential, I believe this split is fairer. This ensures we both get a reasonable share after the value depreciation.""
}
