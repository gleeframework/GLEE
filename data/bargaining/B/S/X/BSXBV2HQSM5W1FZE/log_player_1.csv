"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 
 
I propose a 50/50 split. This seems fair and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While a 60/40 split is tempting, I'm hoping for a more equitable outcome and believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is slightly better than the 50/50 split I proposed in the first round, while still being reasonable. I'm hoping Bob will realize it's in his best interest to accept before the money loses further value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob's offer is significantly worse than the 50/50 split we initially discussed, and with each passing round, the value of the money is decreasing. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise, as I'm willing to concede some of my previous gains to avoid further inflation. However, I still believe this is a fair offer given the current value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I understand the value of the money is decreasing, I cannot accept a deal where I receive only 20% of the total. It's not worth the risk of accepting such a small share, especially given the possibility of negotiating a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. With the money losing value rapidly, I need to secure a larger share to make this worthwhile. While I'm willing to compromise, I'm confident that Bob will be better off accepting this offer than risking losing even more in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  It's clear Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.  While the money is worth less, it's not worth accepting a mere 10% share. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a more equitable agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor. With only a few rounds remaining, I need to secure a significant share to offset the substantial inflation. I'm willing to concede a bit more than my previous offer, but this is the final compromise I'm willing to make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  It's clear that Bob is trying to maximize his share at my expense, leaving me with a meager 5%.  While the value of the money continues to decrease, I won't settle for such an unfair distribution. There's still a chance we can reach a more equitable agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to secure a large portion of the remaining value. I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a significant shift from my previous offer, but it reflects the urgent need to protect myself from further inflation. I believe this is the last chance for Bob to accept a reasonable deal before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  It's clear that Bob is being greedy and trying to take advantage of the situation by offering me a mere 1% of the remaining value. While the money has lost a significant amount of value, I'm not willing to accept such an unfair and insulting deal. I'd rather risk losing everything than accept such a meager share."
