"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the 100k and let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping the rest for myself. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a counteroffer, but I suppose I got a more direct proposal from Bob.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a good one, as it takes into account the decreasing value of money over time. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
