"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm giving you a nice chunk to start with.  Accept this, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000 is a decent amount, Bob knows he can do better.  The inflation factor means that waiting a round will increase his potential earnings significantly.  It's worth the risk to see what Alice's next offer will be."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
