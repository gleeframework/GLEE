"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept quickly so we can avoid the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly and end this quickly, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a quick exit.

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet. I'd rather wait for a better offer, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, don't you think it's time to make a deal?""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the situation and get a slightly better share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but don't expect me to give away all the money 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze me out. Considering the effects of inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd rather get something now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come."
