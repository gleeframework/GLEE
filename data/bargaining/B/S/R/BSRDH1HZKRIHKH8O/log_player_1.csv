"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'll gain 45 dollars, which is worth 95% of the original amount (due to inflation), I'll actually gain 42.75 dollars. I'll accept Bob's offer.
