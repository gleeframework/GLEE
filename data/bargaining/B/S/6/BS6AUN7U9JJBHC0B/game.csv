65.0,35.0,"Bob, this is a negotiation, and we need to find a compromise. Let's meet in the middle â€“ $65 for me, $35 for you. Time is running out, and the value is decreasing!",Alice,3,

43.0,57.0,"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, but I think we can do better. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take $57, and you can have $43. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can end this before the value drops further!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject

,,,Bob,5,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand the urgency, but I'm not willing to settle for $40. Considering the current value, I'll take $55, and you can have $45. This is a fair compromise, and we should take it before the value drops further. Let's end this!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
57.0,43.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the value keeps shrinking.  I'm proposing $57 for me and $43 for you. This is a compromise, and it's better than both of us walking away with nothing when we run out of rounds.",Alice,7,
