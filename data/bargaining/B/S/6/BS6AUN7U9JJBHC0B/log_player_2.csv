# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}
I'm still not satisfied with the offer, and I believe I can push for a better deal. The inflation is affecting Alice's gain more significantly, so I'll try to use that to my advantage in the next round. Let's continue negotiating!"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the value keeps shrinking.  I'm proposing $57 for me and $43 for you. This is a compromise, and it's better than both of us walking away with nothing when we run out of rounds. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}
I think this is a good deal considering the current situation. The inflation has taken a significant toll on the value, and I don't want to risk walking away with nothing. Alice's offer of $43 for me is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it to end the game."
