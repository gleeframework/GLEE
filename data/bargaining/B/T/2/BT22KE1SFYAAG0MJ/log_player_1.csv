"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You get a smaller share, but we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a relatively small share, but it's a quick way to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but you'll still get a decent amount. Let's move on from here. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of 200,000 is actually worth 190,000. That's still a decent amount, but I was hoping for more.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 45% share, which is a bit more generous than my first offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of 300,000 is actually worth 259,400.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to run out of time (and money). I'll have to consider it carefully...
