"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll aim to get an even larger share. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! With the money being worth significantly less, I'll try to take advantage of Bob's offer. Since it's a 50-50 split, it's a relatively fair deal considering the reduced value of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the $500,000."
