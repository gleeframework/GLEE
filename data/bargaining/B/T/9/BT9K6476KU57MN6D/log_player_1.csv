I'm offering Bob a small share to hopefully secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he's willing to take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a much worse deal for me than the one I proposed, and I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly to make it more appealing to Bob. Since he rejected my previous offer, he's probably not interested in a 90/10 split. This should hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than what I offered in round 3.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference with my offer, giving Bob more than the last round but still keeping a larger share for myself. This should hopefully be tempting enough for him to accept, especially since inflation is starting to impact him more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unfavorable to me, even though he's giving me more than the previous round. I'm going to stick to my strategy of increasing my share a little bit each round, and I'm confident he'll eventually accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but this time I'm offering Bob a significantly larger portion than the previous round. With inflation hitting him hard, he may be more willing to accept a deal that gives him a bigger share, even if it's still not equal."
