"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is 80% of the original amount. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money and can start negotiating from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away the farm just yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll need to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, Bob. You're getting a bit more than I'd like, especially considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk I'm taking with this negotiation 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll reassess the offer. Considering the inflation, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than the previous one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",

}
