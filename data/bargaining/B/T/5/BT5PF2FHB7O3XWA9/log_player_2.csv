"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I propose a 60/40 split, but in my favor this time. Let's see if we can agree!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the declining value. Let's settle for 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer my previous offer, Alice's compromise is reasonable given the inflation. I'll take the 4500."
