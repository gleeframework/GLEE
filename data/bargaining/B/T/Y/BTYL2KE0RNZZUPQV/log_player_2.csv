"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it almost equally 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though it's close to equal, it's still not entirely fair, and there are still many rounds to go.  I'm hoping I can get a better deal later on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 51,
""alice_gain"": 49,
""message"": ""I think it's important to be fair, but I also want to make sure I get a slightly better deal than last time. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bit more than half 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject this offer.  While it's a bit better than the previous round, I'm hoping I can get a deal closer to a 50/50 split before the money starts to lose value too much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's just split this evenly. It's the fairest way, and we both get the same amount. Time is ticking, and the money is losing value.""
