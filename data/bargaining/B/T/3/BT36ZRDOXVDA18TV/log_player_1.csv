I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair offer considering I'm taking the initiative in this first round.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 215687 
# Bob gain: 784313 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm still aiming for a significant share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid getting nothing.  Let's see if Bob is more receptive this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380827 
# Bob gain: 619173 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, I'm sticking with my strategy of trying to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm confident that Bob will see this as a better offer than the previous ones. I'm hoping to get a deal done before the inflation cuts into my gains too severely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 522928 
# Bob gain: 477072 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting a bit risky. I'm not happy with the amount, but I'm concerned about the potential for further inflation.  This offer is closer to a 50/50 split than anything Bob has offered before, so I'll take it."
