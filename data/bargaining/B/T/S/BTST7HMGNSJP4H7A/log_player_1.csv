Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money by being stubborn.  A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob is right, we're both losing money by being stubborn. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal later or even losing everything if we run out of rounds."
