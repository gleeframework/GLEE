Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to take the lion's share in the first round.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small portion.  I'll be sure to factor in inflation as we go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer gives me a decent amount.  I'd rather get 300,000 now than risk getting nothing if we keep going and I can't get a better offer."
