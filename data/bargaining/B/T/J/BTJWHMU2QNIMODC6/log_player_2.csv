"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 70 and you can have 30. It's a good starting point!

# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The 20% inflation per round is a big factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 60/40, with me taking 60.  This gives us a good starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. I'll take 55 and you can have 45. It's still a fair split, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is moving towards a more even split, and the inflation is hitting hard.  This is a good deal for me considering the value is dropping."
