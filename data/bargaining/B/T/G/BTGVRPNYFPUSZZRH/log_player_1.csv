"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm starting with a large offer to try and ensure we can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm offering a compromise with $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob.  Since I'm aware of the inflation, I'm willing to take a slight reduction from my previous offer to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split and given the inflation, I'm likely to get a worse deal if we continue."
