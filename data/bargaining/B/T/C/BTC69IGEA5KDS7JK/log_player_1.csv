"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so the actual amount I'll get is $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000. The amount Bob gets is $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000.

I'll reject this offer because I'm getting less than I proposed in the first round, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.
