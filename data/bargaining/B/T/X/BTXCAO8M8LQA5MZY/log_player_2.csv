"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I'm confident we can work out a better deal for both of us in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a quick $100,000, there are 12 rounds, and the value of the money will decrease with each round.  Rejecting allows me to make the next offer and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits us both before the value of the money decreases further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go down to a 55/45 split, but I believe this is a fair compromise given the dwindling value of the money. Let's make a decision quickly before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Accepting this offer gives me a decent amount of money, and it avoids further risk of losing even more in subsequent rounds."
