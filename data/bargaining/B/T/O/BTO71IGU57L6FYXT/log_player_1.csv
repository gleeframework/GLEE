"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 split seems like a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of 90% of the original amount, which is 81% of the original amount. So, in this round, I'll get 81% of 5000, which is 4050.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best option for me, considering the inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 10% inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of 81% of the original amount, which is 65.61% of the original amount. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Accept this offer and we can move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation applied four times, my gain is now worth 81% * 81% * 81% * 90% = 52.41% of the original amount. I'll calculate my gain for this round: 52.41% of 4500 is approximately 2356.65.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if a 55/45 split is fair, considering the significant inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 10% inflation applied five times, my gain is now worth 52.41% * 90% = 47.17% of the original amount. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. This is my best offer. Accept and we can end this.""
}
```"
