"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is a pretty standard opening move. I'm taking the lion's share, but leaving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to turn the tables on me. I'm not going to accept a deal where I get a tiny share, especially since I know he's losing more value with each round. It's time to show him I'm not afraid to play hardball."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount.  I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to be bullied.  Let's see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it. I'm still holding out for a better deal. I know the stakes are getting higher, but I'm confident I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm also making a bigger concession to Bob this time.  I want to demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise and avoid a stalemate, but I'm still not going to give him the majority.  He's losing value with each round, so hopefully he'll realize that it's better to take this offer than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting tense!  Bob is clearly trying to strong-arm me, but I'm still not going to give in. I'm holding firm because I know he's losing more value than I am with each passing round. I'm confident I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm taking a bigger risk here by lowering my share significantly. I'm hoping that with Bob losing so much value due to inflation, he'll realize it's better to take a slightly smaller share now than risk getting nothing. The pressure is mounting, but I'm still confident I can reach a deal before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous!  I'm still not giving in to his pressure tactics.  The inflation is hitting him hard, and I know he's starting to panic.  But I'm not going to give in to his demands, I'm still aiming for a more equitable split!  We have only a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

It's time to make a bold move. The inflation is hitting both of us now, and we're running out of time.  I'm offering an even split. This is the fairest and most likely way to reach an agreement. I'm hoping Bob will see that, as time is running out and the stakes are higher than ever.  Let's see if he finally comes to his senses!"
