Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and that inflation is only getting worse for you.  I'll take a slightly larger share (65/35) but this is your best chance to secure a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
