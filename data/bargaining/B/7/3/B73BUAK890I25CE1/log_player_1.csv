"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm actually getting 4750 in ""real"" terms (5000 x 0.95). Meanwhile, Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 14% less than my original offer of 5000, which is a significant difference.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer in this round should be more favorable to me to account for the decrease in the value of money. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share to account for the inflation, but I'm still trying to be fair and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly! Considering the significant decrease in the value of money, I need to be cautious. If I accept this offer, my gain of 4000 is worth 43.75% of the original $10,000 (10,000 x 0.95 x 0.9526), which is a significant decrease.

However, I also need to consider that Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 40% of the original $10,000 (10,000 x 0.9526 x 0.968), which is also a significant decrease.

Given the circumstances, I'll accept this offer.
