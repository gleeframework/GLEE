Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. It's a fair offer, and we both get a decent amount. Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, with her offer now being much closer to even. However, time is affecting Bob at a slower rate.  It's worth pushing the envelope a bit further to see if Alice will break."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be serious. This is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my best offer considering the dwindling value of the money. It's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's be reasonable and end this game. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. The longer the game goes on, the more Bob is hurt by the inflation differential. Taking the $450,000 now is better than risking getting a worse deal later or even ending up with nothing."
