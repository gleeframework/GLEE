I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm aiming for a large initial share, knowing the money will depreciate quicker for Bob than me. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, I'm still in a strong position.  The inflation rate is higher for me, but I still have more rounds to negotiate. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but still aiming for a significant portion.  Bob might be feeling the pressure of inflation more now, so I want to see if he'll accept something closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. Even though the inflation is hitting me harder now, I'm not giving in. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round. The money is depreciating faster for me, but the value is still significant."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm taking a bigger hit on my share this time, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. We're both feeling the effects of inflation, and I need to be realistic about what I can get. I think Bob is starting to feel the pressure, so I'm hoping he'll be more receptive to my offer this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. The inflation is really hurting me now, but I'm not giving up. I'm determined to get a better deal, even if it means risking everything. I'll keep fighting until the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm making another concession, but I'm still holding out for a decent share. The inflation is crippling, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we're both losing value with every passing round.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not giving up yet."
