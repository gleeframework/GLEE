"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000 and keep $8,000. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I propose a 50/50 split.  It's the most equitable way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money I gain is still worth 8000, but Bob's gain is worth 1800 (10% less than 2000).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially since I was initially willing to offer you a smaller share. However, I'm willing to compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
