Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you 450,000, and keeping 550,000 for myself.  While your offer was generous, I'm hoping we can find a split that's fairer for both of us. Remember, the money is worth less with every round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
