Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems you're serious about finding a fairer deal. I'm adjusting my offer to 60/40, acknowledging the time pressure. It's a strong offer considering the inflation, and it benefits us both to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
