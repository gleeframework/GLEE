"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection in this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist with the inflation affecting Bob's gain.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 60/40 split is indeed a bit more favorable to him, but I'm not sure if it's entirely fair considering the risk of rejection is still on both of us.

However, I'm not eager to give up more than I have to, so I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a bit more than 40% of the remaining amount.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to account for the risk of rejection""
}
```"
