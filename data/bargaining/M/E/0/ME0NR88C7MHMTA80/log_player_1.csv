"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get a decent amount, and Bob gets a decent amount as well, so we can both be happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 30$ is now worth 27$ (10% less than 30$), and Bob's gain of 70$ is now worth 67.5$ (5% less than 70$).

I accept Bob's offer.
