I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob. Since we have many rounds to go, I want to establish a good relationship and see if he's willing to cooperate.  I'll take 99% and leave him with 1%. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Bob's offer is a fair split, and accepting it guarantees me a significant portion of the money.  While inflation is a factor, I'm not sure how it affects Bob, so it's better to secure a good deal now than risk further negotiations."
