Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting by being generous to Bob, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting significantly less than I initially proposed, accepting this offer is the best option for me. Inflation is rapidly devaluing the money, and if I reject this offer, I risk getting nothing in the next round."
