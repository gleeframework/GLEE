"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it closer to the middle, and we can both come out ahead. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

Alice's gain: $6,000 (same as Round 1)
Bob's gain: $4,400 (20% less than $5,500)

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
