"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it closer to the middle, and we can both come out ahead.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not my ideal split, accepting this offer means I'll still get a decent amount, and I'm not sure I can do much better given the inflation factor."
