"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end the game here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a small share, but I'm not giving up much. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the reduced value of money."
