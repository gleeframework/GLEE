"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40 dollars and keep 60 dollars for myself. I'll also include a message saying ""Let's be fair!"" to try to persuade him to accept my offer.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to take that into account when considering Bob's offer. Bob is offering me 40 dollars, but it's worth 5% less, so it's actually worth 38 dollars to me. Bob is getting 60 dollars, but it's worth 10% less to him, so it's actually worth 54 dollars to him.\n\nI don't think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. I think I can get a better deal if I reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to take into account the inflation again and make an offer that I think Bob might accept. Since the money is worth less to both of us, I'll try to find a compromise that takes that into account.\n\nI'll offer Bob 45 dollars and keep 55 dollars for myself. I'll also include a message saying ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal!"" to try to persuade him to accept my offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal!""}\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, we both need to get something out of this! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less. Considering this, I'll recalculate the values of the offer.\n\nBob is offering me 45 dollars, but it's worth 14.26% less, so it's actually worth approximately 38.58 dollars to me. Bob is getting 55 dollars, but it's worth 27.1% less to him, so it's actually worth approximately 40.10 dollars to him.\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is relatively fair. Since we're already in the 4th round and the money's value is decreasing rapidly, I don't want to risk going further and getting even less. I'll accept Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nYour turn!"
