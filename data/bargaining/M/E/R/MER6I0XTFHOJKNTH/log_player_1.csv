"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'll wait for Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a good opportunity to compromise. Meeting in the middle seems fair, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with further reduced value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
