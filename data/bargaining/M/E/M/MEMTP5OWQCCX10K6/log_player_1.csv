Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's agree now and both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
