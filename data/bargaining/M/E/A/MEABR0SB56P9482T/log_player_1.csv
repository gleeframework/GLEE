I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share. I want to see if he's willing to accept a small amount now, or if he'll gamble for a bigger share later. Remember, with each round, the value of the money decreases for me, so I need to act fast!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share,  it's not worth risking the entire 1 million dollars. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and with each passing round, the value of the money I receive diminishes. It's better to take what I can get now."
