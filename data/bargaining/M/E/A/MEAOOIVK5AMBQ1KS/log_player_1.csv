"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll offer Bob $10 and keep $90 for myself. Since the money is worth less for him each round, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $10, I know that if I reject this, I get to propose in the next round. Since inflation is working in my favor and Bob's offer is very unequal, I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since inflation is hitting Bob harder, I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing than the previous 10/90 split. Let's see if he'll accept!"
