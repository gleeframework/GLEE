"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer heavily favors me, but it ensures you get something. With each round that passes, the total amount we can split decreases for me, making future offers potentially less appealing for you. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is fairer.  Let's avoid the risk of decreasing returns with further delays.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was far too low. I'm willing to be reasonable, but I also need a fair share. This offer still heavily favors me, but it's closer to a compromise. Let's settle this before inflation further erodes the value. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor me to a low amount and is using the threat of inflation against me. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're approaching the halfway point, and I'm willing to make a significant concession. This is a much larger share than you've offered, and it's a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is starting to come down, her offer is still not in the realm of what I consider ""fair"" or a ""significant concession"". She's right about the time pressure, but I'm betting she's getting more anxious about the deal falling through than I am.  I need to hold strong and signal I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a reasonable share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm. This split is more than fair, especially considering the time pressure.  Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this.  You're not acknowledging the impact inflation is having.  This is a reasonable offer given the circumstances.  Let's be sensible and end this. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is trying to use a classic negotiation tactic – claiming to be firm while repeating her position.  She's also trying to leverage the inflation factor, but I'm not buying it. My offer is still on the table, and it's more than generous considering the circumstances. I'm calling her bluff. Let's see what she does now."

{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
