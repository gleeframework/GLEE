950000.0,50000.0,"Let's make a deal. This offer heavily favors me, but it ensures you get something. With each round that passes, the total amount we can split decreases for me, making future offers potentially less appealing for you.",Alice,1,

850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, your offer was far too low. I'm willing to be reasonable, but I also need a fair share. This offer still heavily favors me, but it's closer to a compromise. Let's settle this before inflation further erodes the value.",Alice,3,
