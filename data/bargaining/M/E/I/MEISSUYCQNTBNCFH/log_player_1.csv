Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering inflation is affecting you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing money with each round, and you're just holding out for a slightly bigger slice. My final offer is $5,800 for me, $4,200 for you. Take it or leave it.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But I think I've waited long enough. Considering the inflation, I think my offer is more than fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the impact of inflation is severe. While getting $4,000 is significantly less than what I aimed for initially, rejecting this offer means risking even greater losses in the next round. Bob seems unlikely to budge, and waiting any longer will only hurt me more. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting is the most logical choice in this unfavorable situation."
