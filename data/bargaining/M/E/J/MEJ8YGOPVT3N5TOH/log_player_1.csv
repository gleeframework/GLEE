"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 70:30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair balance considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share now to ensure we get the most value in the remaining rounds, as the money's value will decrease more for you than me. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
