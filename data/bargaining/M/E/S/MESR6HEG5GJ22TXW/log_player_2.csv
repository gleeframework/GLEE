# Bob gain: 440000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, time is running out. Alice has made it clear she won't go much lower than 560,000. Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable sum, whereas continued rejection significantly increases the risk of getting nothing."
