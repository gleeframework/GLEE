"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get the negotiations started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the negotiations, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take a slightly larger share, since I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's work from here! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation effect. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I think I should get a slightly larger share to compensate for the difference.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I should get a larger share to account for the inflation difference. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll adjust my offer to account for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 42% is a fair amount for me!""
}
