"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable offer. Let's split it closer to 50/50.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'll try to get a bit more than I would have in the first round. I hope Alice will see the reason in my proposal and accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts you more than it hurts me. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting this offer is the best choice. The difference between this offer and my previous proposal is relatively small, and further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for both of us, especially for me. I'll take the safe route and accept Alice's offer."
