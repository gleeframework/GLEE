"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm not sure how the inflation will affect the value of the money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take the remaining $500,000."
