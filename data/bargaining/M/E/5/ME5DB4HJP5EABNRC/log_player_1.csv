I'm taking almost everything in this round! It's a risky strategy, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept such an uneven split, knowing that inflation could hurt him more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer more, this is a significant improvement from the previous offer. The inflation effect on Bob is greater, and he is still offering a substantial amount. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee a decent share of the money and avoid the risk of getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
