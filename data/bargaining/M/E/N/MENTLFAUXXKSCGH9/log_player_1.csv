"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't be serious with 50/50, I'm the one who's going to make the deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's aggressive tone, but I'll consider the proposal.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With this offer, I'd be getting $400,000, which is less than half of the original amount.

After some thought, I've decided to...

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's got some confidence, doesn't he?

With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit worried. Bob's offer is even more lopsided than before, with me getting only $300,000.
