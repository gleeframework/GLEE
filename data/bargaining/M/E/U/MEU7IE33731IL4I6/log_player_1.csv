"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about inflation, Alice, but 60/40 is too skewed for me. How about a 52/48 split in your favor? It's a better deal than what we'll both get in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
