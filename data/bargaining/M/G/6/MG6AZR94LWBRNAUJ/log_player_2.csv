"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer might seem fair at first glance, the inflation factor makes it disadvantageous for Bob in the long run. By rejecting, Bob can propose a better deal for himself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly, considering the inflation factor. This offer is fairer for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is heavily impacting you, Bob. I'm offering a good deal considering the circumstances. Take it before it gets worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer seems generous, considering the inflation factor, the percentage Bob is getting is lower than in Round 1. Bob should continue to try and negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""The inflation is impacting me significantly. I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself, but still a more even split than before.  Let's reach a deal that works for both of us.""}
