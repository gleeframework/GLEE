"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the new values are:

* My gain: $6,000 x 0.9 = $5,400
* Bob's gain: $4,000 x 0.9 = $3,600

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split, but I'll make sure to adjust my calculations accordingly:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
