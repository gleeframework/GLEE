"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nMy turn again! \n\n###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""A little more for me!""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nFinally!\n###\n\nSince I chose to accept Bob's offer, the game is over. Let's calculate my gain after inflation.\n\nInitial money value = $100\nMy gain = 45% of $100 = $45\n\nInflation rate per round = 20%\nTotal rounds = 4\n\nInflation rate after 4 rounds = (1 - 0.2)^4 = 0.512\n\nMy gain after inflation = $45 * 0.512 = $23.04\n\nSo, after 4 rounds of negotiations, I, Alice, will receive $23.04.\n\nBob's gain remains the same, $55.\n\nIt was a tough negotiation, but I'm glad we could come to an agreement in the end.\n###\n\nTHE END.\n###\n\nWould you like to play again?\n###\n\nType 'yes' to play again or 'no' to quit.\n###\n\n(Note: If you want to play again, I'll start a new game with Bob. If you want to quit, I'll say goodbye.)\n###\n\nPlease respond with either 'yes' or 'no'.\n###\n\nI'm waiting for your response...\n###\n\n###\n\n(Please respond, and I'll take it from there!)"
