"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so my gain of $60 is now worth $57.60. The money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, so his gain of $40 is now worth $36.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be gaining $50, which is worth $47.50 after inflation.

I think this is a reasonable offer, so I'll accept it.
