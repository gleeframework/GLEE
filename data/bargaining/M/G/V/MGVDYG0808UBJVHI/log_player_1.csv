"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take it all, don't bother responding""
}
```

This is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to get the best deal I can in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer! I accept this proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
