"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up 80% of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A fair split, considering the inflation. Accept and let's finalize.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a bit more aggressive than before, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about a fair split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. With the adjusted values, I'm not sure if this offer is as bad as it seems. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $400,000. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking even lower values due to inflation."
