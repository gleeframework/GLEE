"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

This is a classic ultimatum game.  I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept.  I'm confident in this offer because, if he rejects, he risks a smaller share in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy!  Even with the inflation, 10% of the money is not a good deal.  I'm rejecting this offer and holding out for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer.  This offer should be appealing to Bob as he knows if he rejects, the next round will be even worse for him with the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being unreasonable! My share has decreased significantly due to inflation, but I'm not going to settle for such a low offer. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25} 
```

I'm lowering my share again, but this is a reasonable compromise.  Bob is clearly being stubborn, but I'm hoping he realizes that he's in danger of getting nothing if he continues to reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are getting more and more outrageous. I won't accept this deal. I'm still hoping for a better split, even though the inflation is eating away at my potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35} 
```

I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, but I'm still trying to secure a decent share. Bob needs to understand that we're both losing money with each passing round, and it's in his best interest to accept this offer before it gets worse for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous!  I'm losing out on so much money due to inflation, and Bob is still being unreasonable. I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal, even though the odds are stacked against me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45} 
```

This is a risky move, but I'm desperate. Inflation is eating away at my potential earnings, and I'm starting to run out of time.  I'm offering a more even split, hoping that Bob finally sees the sense in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a 50/50 split, which isn't great, but I'm losing a huge amount to inflation.  I can't afford to be greedy any longer.  I'm accepting this offer to avoid getting nothing at all."
