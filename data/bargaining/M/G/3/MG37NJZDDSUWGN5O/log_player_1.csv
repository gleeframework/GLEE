"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Inflation is a factor, but I think fairness is more important. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
