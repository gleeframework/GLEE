**Reasoning:** While the situation is getting dire, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to even the previous round. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. It's a risky move, but holding out hope for a slightly better offer in the remaining rounds might be the only way to salvage a less unfavorable outcome."

{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""This is my absolute last offer.  We need to settle this now before we both lose out completely.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Time is critically short. While not ideal, accepting Alice's terms in the previous round would have been disastrous due to the inflated losses.  This offer is a last-ditch attempt to secure a reasonable amount before the time runs out entirely.  It's a high-stakes gamble, hoping Alice understands the dire situation and prioritizes getting something over nothing."
