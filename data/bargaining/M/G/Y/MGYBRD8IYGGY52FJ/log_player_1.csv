"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. It's still a fair deal considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a 20% toll on my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's proposal, I think 40% is still a bit too low for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like a bit more. Can we discuss a 50/50 split?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value. I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I think 55/45 is a reasonable split. It's not as bad as it sounds!""
}
```"
