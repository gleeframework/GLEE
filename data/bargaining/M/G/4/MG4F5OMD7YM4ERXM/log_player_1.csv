Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd rather take a bit less now than risk losing more to inflation. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I pushed for a better deal in Round 3, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice now. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation. He's willing to take a slightly smaller share than our initial agreement to avoid further losses.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer means risking an even lower offer from Bob in a future round, where his share will be worth even less to him due to inflation. 

It's a good compromise that still gives me a slightly better than 50/50 split.
