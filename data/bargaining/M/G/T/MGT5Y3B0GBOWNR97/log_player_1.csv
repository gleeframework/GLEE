"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this round, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'll gain are:

* My gain: $20 * 0.95 = $19 (since my gain is worth 5% less)
* Bob's gain: $80 * 0.9 = $72 (since Bob's gain is worth 10% less)

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reject this offer.
