"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share for each of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is the most reasonable split. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth $6,400. And now Bob is offering a 50/50 split.

I'll consider this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'd rather get more than $5,000. But it's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
