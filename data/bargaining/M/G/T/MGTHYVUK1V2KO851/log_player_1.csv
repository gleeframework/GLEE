"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather not accept a smaller share, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time""
}
```

I'm adjusting my share to account for the inflation, and trying to meet Bob in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take a toll on my potential gain. Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather not accept a smaller share, especially since I'm losing value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I need to be fair to myself too""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests, while also considering the effects of inflation."
