Let's see if Bob is willing to take a small share to get something right away!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take the larger share, I'm not sure what Bob's strategy is. I need to see what happens in the next few rounds to figure out how to maximize my potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than he offered me, but still a decent chunk. I'm hoping that he'll see that it's better to take this offer than to risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive.  While this offer is tempting,  I'm going to reject it again. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm holding out for a better deal. I think I can get more if I stick with it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly. This is a risky move because inflation is taking its toll, but I'm hoping to sway Bob towards accepting before things get too bad."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I think I need to accept this offer. Inflation is eating away at my potential earnings, and I'm worried that if I reject this offer, things will get worse.  I'll take the $600,000, even though it's much less than I hoped for.  I'm not sure Bob is being entirely fair, but at this point, I need to secure something."
