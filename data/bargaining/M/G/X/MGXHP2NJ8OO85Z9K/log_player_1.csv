"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as keen on this offer. I'd like to reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me again, so I'll make a new offer:
