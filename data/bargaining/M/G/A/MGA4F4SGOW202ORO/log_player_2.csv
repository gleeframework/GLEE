Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, this is as low as I'll go 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely impacting Bob.  While a 43/57 split isn't ideal, rejecting this offer means risking an even worse outcome in future rounds where the value of his share will diminish further. 

It's a tough choice, but accepting minimizes potential losses."
