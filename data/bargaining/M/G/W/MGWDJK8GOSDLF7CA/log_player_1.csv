"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a good starting point, and I think it's a fair way to begin the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking. In this round, my $3000 gain is equivalent to $2850 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as I'd like to get a larger share of the pie. However, I'll consider it. If I reject this offer, I'll have to make a proposal in the next round, and I'm not sure I can do better.

For now, I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
