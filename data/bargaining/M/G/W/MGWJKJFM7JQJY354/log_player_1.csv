Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself. This 40/60 split should be acceptable.

# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
