"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to take the larger share, but I'm open to negotiating. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not sure I like the way Alice framed the offer. She's already claiming a larger share and just being ""open to negotiating"" feels like a weak tactic.  I'm going to reject this and see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This ensures we both get a significant share and we can move on to bigger things.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get at least 60% to feel it's worth my time. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite.  Getting 400,000 is better than risking getting nothing.  I'll accept Alice's offer."
