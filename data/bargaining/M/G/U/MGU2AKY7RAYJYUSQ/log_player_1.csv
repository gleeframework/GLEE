"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more equal split, the risk of getting nothing is too high with each passing round. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least something, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
