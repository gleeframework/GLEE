"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take the 1000 and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1000 and keeping $9000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor that will affect the money's value over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle is a good start, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation factor. I'll propose something in the next round.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking forward to making a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the devaluation of money. This is a fair split considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself, trying to find a balance between a fair split and accounting for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering my original proposal was 5000. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as I think $5800 is a fair share considering the current value of the money. I'm glad we could come to an agreement!"
