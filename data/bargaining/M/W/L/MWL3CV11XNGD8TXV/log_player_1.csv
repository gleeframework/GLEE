"Round 1

I propose you get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I want to ensure a fair split while also maximizing my own gain.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy!  I'll take my chances in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm lowering my share, but still aiming for a good split.  Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'll need to be more flexible.  Let's see if he'll accept this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too aggressive.  I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially with the inflation affecting my earnings.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  Inflation is taking a toll, and I need to secure a decent amount.  A fair split seems like the best option at this point. Let's see if Bob will agree."
