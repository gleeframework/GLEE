"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair and balanced split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I think this is a fair and balanced split, considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'm not surprised he's trying to take a larger share. However, I'm not willing to give up too much.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly more generous split""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer. I'm willing to give up some of my share to try to reach a compromise and avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting less, I'm getting more, deal? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal again, but I'll think it through.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him getting a larger share. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that, especially since my share is already decreasing in value.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Last chance for a 50-50 split""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This is my last offer, so I hope Bob will consider it."
