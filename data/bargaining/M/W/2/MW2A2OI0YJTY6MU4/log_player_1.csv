"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (9000$) and leaves 1000$ for Bob. It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering a deal that is extremely unfavorable to me. I am better off waiting for the next round, even though the money will be worth less. This is a test of his rationality. If he's willing to play this game strategically, he'll offer me a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a large majority of the money.  This is a compromise, but I believe it's still in my favor, especially since the money is worth less now than in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer.  Even though the money is worth less now, it's still a significant sum, and Bob is offering me a very small portion of it.  The inflation factor is playing a bigger role, but I believe I can still get a better deal if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that this shows him I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still rejecting. The money is worth less, but it's still better than getting nothing. If Bob is truly playing strategically, he should be starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling time.  I believe he'll offer me a better deal soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer once more.  I'm starting to feel the pressure from the inflation, but I'm still confident in my ability to get a decent share of the money. I believe this offer is a fair compromise, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation."
