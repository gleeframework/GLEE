"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\nI'll propose an equal division of the money, with a message to Bob explaining the fairness of this split given the conditions of the game. This approach aims to establish a baseline of trust and reasonableness, considering that the value of the money decreases for me with each round, but remains constant for Bob. An equal split initially seems like a straightforward and equitable starting point, acknowledging that subsequent negotiations may be influenced by the asymmetrical impact of inflation on our valuations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a compromise. This offer accounts for the inflation impact on your share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\nGiven the impact of inflation and Bob's attempt to find a compromise, I'll evaluate the offer considering the decreased value of the money for me. However, since this is just the second round and there's room for negotiation, I might lean towards rejecting the offer if it doesn't align closely with my perception of a fair adjustment for the inflation.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3\nConsidering the compromise attempt by Bob in the previous round and the ongoing impact of inflation on my share, I'll propose a division that slightly adjusts from the initial equal split but still recognizes the value decrease over rounds. This offer aims to balance the fairness and the urgency due to inflation's asymmetrical effect.

### Human: Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, 40% less than in the second round, and 60% less than in the third round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your inflation, I'll offer slightly more than last time to compensate.
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?
### Assistant: ### Alice: Round 4\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation and the slight increase in Bob's offer to compensate for it, I need to weigh the benefit of accepting now against the potential for further negotiations. The value of the money for me decreases significantly with each round, making earlier agreements more beneficial in absolute terms.
