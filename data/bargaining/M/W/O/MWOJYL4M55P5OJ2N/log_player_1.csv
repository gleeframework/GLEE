Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split.  This offer gives you a fair share, but also allows me to keep more of the value as the rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 650000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer gives you a fair share while still maximizing my gains before inflation hits too hard.  I believe it's in our best interest to come to an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into his potential gains. While this offer is better than his Round 2 offer, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I need to hold out for a much better deal. The longer this goes on, the more negotiating power I have."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, because another round will hurt us both.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob.  This offer is still heavily weighted in my favor, taking into account the inflation. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping Bob will realize he needs to accept a less favorable deal before the value diminishes even further."
