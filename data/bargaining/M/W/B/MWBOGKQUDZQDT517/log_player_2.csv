Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my counter-offer. It's important we reach a deal soon, as the devaluation is hurting us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but time pressure is becoming a major factor. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer ensures I get something substantial before the devaluation eats away at the value."
