"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair, considering the inflation we both have to deal with. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that a 51/49 split is fair, considering I'm still getting less than 50%. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. It's still a decent deal for both of us.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and propose a slightly more favorable split for myself, while still being reasonable and fair."
