Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```

}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards him, but it's a better offer than the previous one. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was still biased towards him. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the significant inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was still biased towards him. Here's my new proposal:

```

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
