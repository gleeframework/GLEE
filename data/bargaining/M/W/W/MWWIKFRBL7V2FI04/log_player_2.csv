Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to negotiate, but I still think I can get a bit more. Considering the inflation, I'll offer 58% for me and 42% for you. This is a slight concession from my original offer, but still reflects the fact that I'm losing more value to inflation than you are. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the situation. While her offer has decreased slightly, it doesn't reflect the increasingly significant impact of inflation on my share. I need to push for a more substantial change in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're both losing value, but I'm still not convinced by your offer. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. 56% for me and 44% for you is the most I'm willing to concede at this point, given the rising inflation costs I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still not fully acknowledging the impact of inflation. While her offer is moving in the right direction, accepting 44% now would mean losing a significant amount of the potential value compared to the earlier rounds.  It's a risk, but I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and frankly, your insistence on an unfair split is jeopardizing the whole deal. I'm offering 51/49 in your favor â€“ it's more than generous considering the inflation and the fact that we're over halfway through the rounds. Let's be reasonable and close this out.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, but your offer is the first to give you more than me, which I won't accept. Given the situation, I'll slightly adjust my previous offer to 54.5% for me and 45.5% for you. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering I'm losing nearly 41% of the value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 455000 
# Alice gain: 545000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful to see how much value has eroded due to inflation, but Alice is right - her offer is now below her initial 60% ask, and pushing further risks a complete loss.  It's better to secure something rather than walk away with nothing."
