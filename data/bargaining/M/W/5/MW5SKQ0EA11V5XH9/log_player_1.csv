"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not sure I agree with Bob's 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $360,000 (0.9 x $400,000).

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken another 10% bite, so the money is worth 90% of its original value again. My gain of $360,000 is now worth $324,000 (0.9 x $360,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle with a 50/50 split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to find common ground with Bob."
