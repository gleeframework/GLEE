"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get a nice dinner out of it!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leave $40 for Bob. My message to Bob is that I'd like to split the money 60-40, and I'll use my share to treat myself to a nice dinner!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the offer from Bob in Round 2 is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure it's a fair share, I'd like to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 45% is a fair share for me, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'd like to continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my offer in Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, it's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 50% of the remaining $100, which is $50, and leave $50 for Bob. My message to Bob is that I think a 50-50 split is a fair deal, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, the offer from Bob in Round 4 is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm willing to give up that much, I'd like to think about it...""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 48% is a good deal for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd like to think about it and consider other options before making a decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, my offer in Round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly higher share, but I'm still willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and leave $45 for Bob. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to take a slightly higher share, but I'm still open to compromise and finding a mutually beneficial deal."
