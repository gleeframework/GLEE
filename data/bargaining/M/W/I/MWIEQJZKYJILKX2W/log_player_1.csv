Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but I'm still leaving some for Bob to incentivize him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer gives me a smaller share, it's still much better than nothing. However, given the inflation rates, I believe I can do better in the next round when I get to propose."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept before the inflation hits him too hard."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than in the previous round, it's still significantly less than what I was aiming for. The inflation has hit Bob harder, but I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept before the inflation hits him too hard.  Given the inflation rates, I don't think I can get much more in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has taken its toll, Bob's offer is a fair split considering the current circumstances. It's better to accept a fair share now than risk getting nothing due to further inflation."
