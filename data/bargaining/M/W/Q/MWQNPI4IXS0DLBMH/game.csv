,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think 55/45 is a fairer split. The money is worth less with each passing round, so let's make a deal now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  I came down from 60 last round, you went up from 45.  This is a fair compromise to end it here.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Let's meet in the middle. The money is losing value fast, and I think 52/48 is a reasonable compromise.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
51.0,49.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to get this done. 51/49 is my final offer.",Alice,5,
