"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a 40% share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

Alice's gain: 50 * 0.95 = $47.50
Bob's gain: 50 * 0.9 = $45

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a 45% share of the initial $100, and keeping $55 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still not satisfied. I want a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I would gain in this round:

Alice's gain: 45 * 0.8554 (1 - 0.1446) = 38.45
Bob's gain: 55 * 0.7273 (1 - 0.2727) = 40.00

I think this offer is a bit better for me, considering the inflation. I'll accept it.
