{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get a good start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. This is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with. Plus, it's a simple and straightforward proposal that doesn't leave either of us feeling like we're getting the short end of the stick."
