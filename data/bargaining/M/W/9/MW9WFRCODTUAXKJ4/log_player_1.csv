"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 7:3. If you accept, we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, which means I'll get $700,000 and Bob will get $300,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55:45 split is more fair. It's a compromise from your initial offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth 80% of $700,000, which is $560,000. Still a significant amount, but less than what I initially proposed.

However, I'm not convinced that a 55:45 split is fair, especially since I'm already giving up more value due to the inflation. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 55:45 split. I'll propose a 60:40 split in my favor. It's a more balanced compromise.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of $700,000, which is $448,000. I'll aim to get a better deal this round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. A 60:40 split is a reasonable compromise, considering the initial value of the money.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to budge a little more, but I still feel a 52.5:47.5 split is more equitable. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $475,000 is actually worth 47.5% of $700,000, which is $332,500. This is a significant drop from the original $700,000.

I'm not convinced that a 52.5:47.5 split is the best deal for me, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 52.5:47.5 split. I'll propose a 55:45 split in my favor, but only if you're willing to meet me halfway.""
}
