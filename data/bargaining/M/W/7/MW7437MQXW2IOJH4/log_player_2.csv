"Round 1
Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in the sense of a 60/40 split, it's important to consider the potential for greater gains with more rounds of negotiation. Since the money is worth less to Alice in each round, she has a strong incentive to settle sooner. Let's see what she's willing to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I'll take 60% this time, but I'm open to negotiating a more even split if you'd like to continue.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is moving closer to a more even split, but her offer still favors her significantly. I'm willing to hold out for a more equitable division. Since her money is worth less with each round, I'm confident we can reach a better outcome for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest outcome considering the decreasing value of the money for you. We can both get something, but if we keep rejecting, we risk getting nothing.""}
