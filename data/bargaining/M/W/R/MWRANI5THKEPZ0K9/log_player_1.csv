"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and simple. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, but he's still getting a larger share. I'm not sure if I should take it.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share this time, but still keeping it relatively balanced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is making a similar offer to the one I made in round 3, but with slightly different numbers. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, but he's still getting a larger share.

I'll accept this offer.
