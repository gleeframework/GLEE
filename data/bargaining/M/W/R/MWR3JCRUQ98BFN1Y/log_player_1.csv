# Bob's message: I think we should start with a more even split. This is a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as I think I should get a bit more considering the initial amount was $1,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
