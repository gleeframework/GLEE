"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose keeping 9000$ for myself and giving Bob 1000$. I believe this is a fair offer as it reflects my higher contribution to the game and gives Bob a chance to participate. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and the inflation only makes it more unattractive. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for the inflation and Bob's previous rejection. I'm still aiming for a majority of the money but recognizing that I need to offer Bob a more appealing share to incentivize acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation is starting to hurt,  it's clear Bob is not willing to budge. Accepting his offer is the safest option at this point.  Any further rounds will only further diminish the value of my potential gains.  A 50/50 split is far from ideal, but it's better than nothing."
