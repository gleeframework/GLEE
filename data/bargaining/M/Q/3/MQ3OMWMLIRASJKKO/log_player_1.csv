"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since Bob's money depreciates faster, I think he might accept this early offer to get something rather than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. While my money is depreciating, his is depreciating at a much faster rate, giving me leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 80/20, hoping that Bob will see that his money is depreciating quickly and will accept before it's worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse for me, and I'm still confident I can do better.  His money is losing value faster than mine, so I'm going to continue to push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my offer to 75/25. This is still a good deal for me, and Bob is facing a larger rate of inflation, so I'm hoping he'll see the value in taking what he can get before it's worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, which is a good sign that he's feeling the pressure of the inflation on his share. However, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to stick with a slightly lower offer of 70/30.  Bob's money is losing value at a faster rate than mine, and I'm confident he will see the benefit of accepting this offer before his share becomes even smaller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not a good deal for me.  Even though his money is depreciating much faster than mine, I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll reject and see if I can get him to move closer to a 70/30 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to offer a 65/35 split.  We're getting close to the end of the game, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the benefit of accepting a deal before his share of the money becomes practically worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is getting very close to a 60/40 split which is what I was hoping for.  Bob's money is now worth significantly less than mine, so I'm going to accept this offer.  I'm satisfied with the outcome, and I don't want to risk losing everything by continuing to reject and potentially reach the final round."
