I propose to take 900,000$ and let Bob have 100,000$.  It's a big offer, but I'm confident he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a significant amount of money, I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer than the first round, but still give Bob a decent portion.  The inflation will likely make him more agreeable to a deal this time."
