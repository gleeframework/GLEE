I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This is a fair initial offer given the inflation dynamic in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I propose Alice gets $750,000 and Bob gets $250,000.  This is a fair offer given the inflation dynamic and Bob's previous offers. I believe this is a good compromise that gives me a significant share while still allowing Bob to receive a substantial amount."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting better, but the inflation rate for him is making his money worth increasingly less. This is a good deal for me given the inflation."
