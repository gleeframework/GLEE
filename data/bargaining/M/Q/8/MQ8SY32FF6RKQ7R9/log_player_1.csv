Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob $1, hoping to secure the majority of the money.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take 50% now than risk getting nothing later, especially with inflation."
