"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the initial offer seems decent, I need to consider the long-term impact of inflation.  Alice is losing value at a slower rate, so she's likely aiming for a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's find a compromise. This offer is more balanced considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, but she's still trying to capitalize on the faster rate of inflation impacting my share. I need to push for a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and our money is losing value. This offer is fair and prevents further losses for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic about the value loss and find a compromise 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is now reasonably close to the split I was aiming for. Given the increasing impact of inflation and the dwindling number of rounds, accepting this offer is the most logical choice to avoid walking away with nothing."
