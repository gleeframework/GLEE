"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. I'll also include a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but let's find a compromise. This offer is more balanced considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I initially offered a 60-40 split and Bob has countered with a 55-45 split, it seems like we're moving in the right direction. However, considering the inflation, I think I can still negotiate for a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll take into account the effects of inflation and try to find a middle ground. Since Bob offered a 55-45 split, I'll propose a 57-43 split in my favor, considering the decreased value of the money for both of us.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping this revised offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can come to an agreement soon!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and our money is losing value. This offer is fair and prevents further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the effects of inflation becoming more pronounced, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer. Since Bob has offered a 52-48 split, I need to consider whether it's worth continuing to negotiate or if this deal is good enough given the decreasing value of the money.\n\nAt this point, I think I can still push for a slightly better deal, considering the original amount and the fact that we're only four rounds in. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","As we're getting closer to the halfway point, I'll try to find a balance between getting a good deal and considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Since Bob offered a 52-48 split, I'll propose a 54-46 split in my favor, taking into account the effects of inflation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic about the value loss and find a compromise""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping this revised offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can come to an agreement soon, considering the time pressure and the devaluing money."
