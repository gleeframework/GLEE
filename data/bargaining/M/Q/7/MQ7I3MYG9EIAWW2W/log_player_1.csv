"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, 48 for me is still a decent offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
