**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Each round sees a significant devaluation of the money. It's crucial to secure a deal quickly.
* **Shifting Power Dynamic:** As the rounds progress, the devaluation hurts Alice more than Bob. This gives Bob increasing leverage to demand a larger share. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, it creates a sense of urgency and might push Alice to accept a deal rather than risk further devaluation."
