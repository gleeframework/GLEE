70.0,30.0,"I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 7:3. This might seem like a lot, but remember, the value of money decreases by 10% in each round. Let's be smart about our investments.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I understand your desire to maximize your earnings, but I believe a more equitable split is better in the long run. Let's both get a good chunk of the money now, before inflation eats away at it further. This offer is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",Bob,2,
40.0,60.0,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the rate of inflation, I believe my share should be higher to ensure a better return on investment. I propose a 50-50 split, which would be beneficial for both of us considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Considering the inflation rate, I think a 55-45 split would be fair. This way, both of us can secure a portion of the money while accounting for its decreasing value in future rounds. I hope you agree and find this proposal acceptable.",Alice,3,offer
