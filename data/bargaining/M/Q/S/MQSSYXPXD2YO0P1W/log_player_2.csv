"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest if we want to avoid inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think we can find a better split that's more fair to both of us. Let's negotiate a bit more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hurting you more than me. Let's settle this now before we both lose out even more. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation is hurting me significantly.  Accepting this offer is the best way to minimize the losses due to inflation."
