"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a 80-20 split. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll need to consider that. Since my gain remains the same, I'll evaluate the offer based on the decreased value of Bob's gain.

In this round, Bob's $3,000 gain is worth 80% of the original $3,000, due to the 20% inflation. So, in terms of actual value, Bob's gain is $2,400.

Considering my gain of $7,000 is worth the same as in the previous round, I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to aim for a higher value for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm looking for a bigger cut for myself!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, giving me the majority of the $10,000, but still leaving Bob with a small amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, Alice! I'll give you a bit more, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll calculate the actual value of his offer. Since his gain is worth 51.2% of the original $2,000 (100% - 48.8%), his gain is now worth $1,024.

Considering my gain of $7,500 is worth the same as in the previous round, I'll evaluate the offer. I'm not thrilled about giving up $1,500, but I think I can do better.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking for a significant majority!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 95-5 split, giving me a large majority of the $10,000, but still leaving Bob with a small amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about compromising, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll calculate the actual value of his offer. Since his gain is worth 32.77% of the original $2,000 (100% - 67.23%), his gain is now worth $656.40.

Considering my gain of $8,000 is worth the same as in the previous round, I'll evaluate the offer. I'm starting to think that Bob is right, I might not be serious enough about compromising! However, this offer is actually quite close to the original offer I made in round 1, and I'm not sure if I want to go back to that.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to go back to my previous offer, but I'm not budging further!""
}
```

I'm proposing the same 90-10 split as in round 3, which was rejected by Bob. I'm hoping that Bob will reconsider and accept this offer, but I'm not making any further concessions."
