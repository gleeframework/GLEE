"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, 4:1 ratio seems reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer considering I don't know how Bob will respond. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept this offer."
