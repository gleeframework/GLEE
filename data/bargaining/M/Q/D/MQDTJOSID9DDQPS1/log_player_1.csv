"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to balance it out 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the initial high offer!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's too skewed in his favor. I'm not willing to give up 80% of the remaining money in the second round. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You started high, I'll meet you in the middle. Let's try to find a fair split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. This is a 55-45 split, which I think is a more reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's still slightly skewed in his favor. The money is worth less with each passing round, and I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining amount. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 51% is a fair split considering the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $510,000 and keeping $490,000 for myself. This is a 51-49 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise given the current value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 51% is too skewed, I'll try to push for a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to push for an even more favorable split!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's still too skewed in his favor. With the money losing value at such a rapid rate, I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining amount. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 460000,
  ""bob_gain"": 540000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 54-46 is a fair split considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $540,000 and keeping $460,000 for myself. This is a 54-46 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise given the decreasing value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think it's a fair compromise given the current value of the money. The difference between $450,000 and $550,000 is relatively small, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds where the money will be worth even less."
