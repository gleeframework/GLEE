I need to hold firm. While the value is decreasing, I'm still losing money faster than Bob. Accepting a less favorable deal now is worse than holding out for a better one later."

This is a tough one, but I need to accept. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're running out of rounds. Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of getting nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While the offer isn't ideal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Holding out for a slightly better deal in a later round might not be worth the potential loss if we fail to reach an agreement.
* **Bob's Concessions:** Bob is showing a willingness to move closer to the middle ground. This suggests he's feeling the pressure too.

It's better to secure something now, even if it's not perfect, than risk getting nothing at all."
