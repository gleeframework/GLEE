"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's proposal seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation rates, it's actually more advantageous for Bob to reject and propose in the next round.  

* **Bob's Perspective:** If Bob accepts, he gets $400,000. But, in the next round, he'll have the power to propose and with the 20% inflation, the $1,000,000 will be worth less to Alice, giving him a better negotiating position.
* **Alice's Perspective:**  Alice is taking a risk by offering this split, as she knows the money will be worth less to Bob in the next round. 

By rejecting, Bob increases his chances of getting a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this split is fair considering the inflation rates. I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact, this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob's initial offer of $550,000 was rejected. Now, with inflation, he's facing a loss of 36% on his potential gains.  
* **Alice's Perspective:** Alice's gains are also shrinking due to inflation, but at a lower rate than Bob's. She's likely to stick to her offer, knowing that Bob has less bargaining power. 

Accepting Alice's offer gives Bob a guaranteed $420,000.  While this is lower than his initial target, it's better than risking another rejection and facing even higher inflation losses in the next round."
