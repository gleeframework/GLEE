"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money being worth 10% less now, I'm actually getting $400,000, which is equivalent to $360,000 in the first round. Still a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should hold out for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, I'll have to make a new offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000 and keeping $420,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
