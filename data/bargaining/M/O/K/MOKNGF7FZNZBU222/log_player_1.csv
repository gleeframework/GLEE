"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, my gain of $8000 is now worth $7200 in terms of purchasing power.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, but considering the inflation, I'd be gaining $4500 in terms of purchasing power ($5000 / 1.1). I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less in each of the two rounds), my gain of $7200 is now worth $5760 in terms of purchasing power.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too cautious, Bob! Take this deal and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly higher share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more than last round, but I think it's time for you to compromise as well. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less now (10% less in each of the three rounds), my gain of $5760 is now worth $4181.81 in terms of purchasing power.

Bob's offer is a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer. However, considering the inflation, I'd be gaining $4181.81, which is still a decent amount. I'll think carefully before deciding.
