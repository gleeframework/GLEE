"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money fairly. I'll get the majority, but you get a decent chunk too.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount compared to what I'll get, but it's a fair offer considering the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but you'll have to think it's fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll consider the offer carefully. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll think it's fair to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
