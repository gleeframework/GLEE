"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 50/50 split, considering the potential loss of value in future rounds. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
