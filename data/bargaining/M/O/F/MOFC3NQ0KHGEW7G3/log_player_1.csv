"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation""
}
```

In this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $600,000, while Bob would receive $400,000. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a reasonable starting point, as the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob with each round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be generous. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced offer""
}
```

In this offer, I've slightly reduced my share compared to Round 1, taking into account the decreasing value of money for both of us, but still considering that Bob's share loses value faster. Let's see if Bob finds this more acceptable!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's make a deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 530000
