Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose you take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This is a fair starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to reject the offer."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This time I propose a 50/50 split. We're both losing value with every passing round, and this is the fairest way to divide what's left."

While it's tempting to accept any offer at this point due to the decreasing value, I still believe a 50/50 split is the fairest outcome. I'll keep rejecting until Bob comes to a more equitable compromise."

I'm making one last effort to find a compromise. Given the rapid inflation, I'm willing to offer a 40/60 split, with me receiving $400,000 and Bob receiving $600,000. It's the best I can do at this point."

With only two rounds left, I'm making one final compromise to avoid getting nothing. I'm proposing a 35/65 split, with me taking $350,000 and Bob taking $650,000. It's a difficult decision, but it's better than losing everything."
