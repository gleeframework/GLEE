"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. Let's settle this quickly."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The money loses value quickly for both of us. A slightly less favorable deal now is better than a potentially worse one later.
* **Fairness with Urgency:**  While Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor, I'm countering with a proposal that's closer to even, incentivizing her to accept and avoid further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer this drags on, the less we both gain. 
* **Acceptable Offer:** While not ideal, 4200 is still a significant sum. Accepting now prevents further losses due to inflation.  
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems unwilling to budge much further. Rejecting this offer might lead to an even worse outcome in later rounds."
