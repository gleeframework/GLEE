I'm going for a slightly aggressive offer, but I want to leave some room for negotiation if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my previous offer, even taking the inflation into account. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at this price. I'll counter with a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've lowered my offer to be more reasonable.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
