Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5600,

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that inflation is hurting Bob more than me. This should encourage him to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Shifting Split:** I'm slightly increasing my share compared to my Round 1 offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware of the decreasing value.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  While my offer favors me, it's not outrageously so. Bob might see it as a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Bob's offers are getting progressively worse for me.  He's clearly banking on me getting desperate as inflation eats away at the value.
* **Future Leverage:**  While the money is losing value, I'm betting Bob is feeling the pressure more. He's losing value at double my rate. By Round 5, his potential gains will be significantly diminished. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a risk Bob will become stubborn or irrational. However, I'm willing to gamble that the economic pressure will lead him to a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be sensible and end this before we both lose out even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm signaling that I'm done negotiating major shifts in the split.  
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my demand slightly from Round 3, showing I'm willing to meet him a bit, but not at my own significant expense.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  The message emphasizes the losing game inflation is creating for both of us. The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for both sides. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Bob should be acutely aware that this is his last chance to make a proposal where he gains more than half the original amount.  The pressure is on him to accept."
