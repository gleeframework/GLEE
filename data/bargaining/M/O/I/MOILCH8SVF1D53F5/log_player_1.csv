"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a quarter, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 250,000 x 0.9 = 225,000
* Bob gain: 750,000 x 0.9 = 675,000

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40% of the current $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a little less, but I think it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Bob gain: 550,000 x 0.727 = 399,550

I'll accept this offer:

```
