5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, it seems like you're overestimating the impact of the inflation on your end. I'm willing to sweeten the deal slightly, but $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",Alice,3,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking, and every round hurts you more than it hurts me. This is my final offer: $6,500 for me, and $3,500 for you. It's still a decent chunk of the pie, even with the inflation.  Let's be realistic and close this deal.",Alice,5,
