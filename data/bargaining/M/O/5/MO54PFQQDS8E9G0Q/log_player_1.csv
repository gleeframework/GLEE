"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a bit more fair, given we have a limited time to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 55-45 split, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to the inflation. I was hoping for a more favorable split, especially since I made the first offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is still too skewed in your favor. How about 52.5-47.5?""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and compromise with Bob, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal than the 55-45 split he proposed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly - 50/50.  It's the fairest option and ensures we both get a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good one, especially considering the inflation and the limited time we have to reach an agreement. A 50-50 split is a fair and reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Let's finalize the deal and divide the $100 evenly!"
