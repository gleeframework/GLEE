Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your need for a fair share, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor. I'm willing to give you 30% if you accept this offer. We can both still get a good amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000
