"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, we can discuss further""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10$ and keeping 90$. My message is to start with a small difference and discuss further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 50$ in this round is actually 45$ in real value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
