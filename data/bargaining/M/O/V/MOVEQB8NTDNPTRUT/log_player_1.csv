Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven split, hoping to tempt Bob into accepting quickly. It's risky, but it might be the best way to get a large share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair deal. I'd rather get $50 than risk getting nothing at all."
