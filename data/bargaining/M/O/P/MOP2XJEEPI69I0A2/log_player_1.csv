"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly larger share for myself to compensate for the difference in inflation rates.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to carefully consider this new offer.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is slightly more favorable to me than my previous offer, despite the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
