Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly.  I'm offering you $4500 and I'll take $5500.  This way, we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
