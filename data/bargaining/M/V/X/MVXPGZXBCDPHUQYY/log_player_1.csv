"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't do much better than this, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth $180,000 (10% less than the original $200,000).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get, but I'll consider it. After all, he's right that I might not be able to do much better.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
