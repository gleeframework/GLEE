"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Bob's message: You can't have all the fun, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a larger share right from the start.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too lopsided. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a more balanced split.""
}

# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my previous rejection.

I'll reject this offer as well. This offer is extremely lopsided and doesn't reflect a fair division of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not even close to a fair split. I'm not settling for such a small share.""
}
```"

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, I'm not going to settle for such a tiny share. I'll keep negotiating!""

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're going to leave with nothing, enjoy the $1000! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to humiliate me with a very low offer.

I'll reject this offer as well. I'd rather leave with nothing than accept a share of $1000. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept such a ridiculously low offer. Game over!""

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You get nothing, I take it all! 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the entire amount.

I'll reject this offer as well. I'd rather leave with nothing than let Bob take the entire amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, I'm not going to let you take it all. Game over, I guess!""

It looks like we've reached the end of the game. Neither of us will get any money, but at least we tried!"
