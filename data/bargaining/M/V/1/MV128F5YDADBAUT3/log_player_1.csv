"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm still gaining $7,000. But the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, so he's gaining $3,600 (4000 * 0.9).

I'll accept this offer.
