"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering to take 70% of the money, which is a generous offer, and leave 30% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept this offer.
