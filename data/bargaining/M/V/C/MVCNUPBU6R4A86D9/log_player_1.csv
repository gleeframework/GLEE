"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is fair. I was willing to give him 40% in the first round, and now he's asking for 60%. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think I should get a bigger share considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more now""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the money and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I still think I should get a slightly bigger share considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I was willing to give him 45% in the first round, and now he's asking for 55%. I think I should get a bigger share considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's getting late and we should compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a compromise from my previous offers. I think it's time to find a middle ground and end the game, as we're running out of rounds."
