"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It benefits us both to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure about a 60/40 split right off the bat, especially since the money is worth less to me with each round. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45 in my favor.  It's a fair compromise considering the inflation factor.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us.  My offer is now 62/38.  It's getting less appealing for you with each round, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with the split.  The inflation is seriously affecting my share, and I'm confident I can do better if we keep going."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise a little more.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the time is ticking away, and we both stand to lose more if we continue.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is now 65/35.  Accept this, or I'm afraid we'll both be walking away empty-handed.  Don't let greed be your downfall. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. While I recognize the risk of getting nothing, I'm holding out hope for a more equitable split. The inflation is hurting me significantly, but I believe I can negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to give you 35% if you accept this offer.  This is a fair compromise, and we can avoid both losing everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is your last chance. 70/30, take it or leave it.  The clock is ticking, and frankly, I'm surprised you haven't caved already. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I have to accept this offer. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential earnings, and there is a real risk of getting nothing if we continue.  While 70/30 is not ideal, it's better than walking away empty-handed."
