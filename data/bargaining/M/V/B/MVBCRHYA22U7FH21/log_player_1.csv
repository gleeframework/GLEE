"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid going into the second round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 90% of what I could have gotten in the first round. That's a significant reduction.

I'll reject the offer for now. I'm hoping to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% bite, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping he'll accept and we can avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice, take this! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking its toll! I'm getting desperate, indeed!

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $300,000, which is worth a mere 30% of what I could have gotten in the first round. That's a tough pill to swallow.

But, I'm not sure I have a better option, and Bob's offer is still a significant amount. I'll take it.
