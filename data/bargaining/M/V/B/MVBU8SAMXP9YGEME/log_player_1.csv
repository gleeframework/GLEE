"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll start""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm sending this offer to Bob, and my message is ""Let's split it evenly, I'll start""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an even split, I'll try to do better 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob is trying to do better than the initial even split, I'll consider his offer. However, I'm not convinced that I should accept an offer that's still not exactly equal.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to nudge the offer in my favor a bit more, while still being reasonable. My message to Bob is ""You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied"", hinting that I'm willing to compromise, but not yet satisfied with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to let you have all the upside, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the effects of inflation are starting to bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I initially proposed. However, I do want to get closer to a deal. Meeting in the middle might be a good compromise, especially since the money is worth less now.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's a good enough compromise to end the game.
