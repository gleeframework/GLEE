"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  This seems like a fair starting point, given that we're both trying to maximize our own gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though my money is worth less, it's still better than the risk of getting nothing in the next round with even further inflation."
