# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I think a 50/50 split is indeed fair. Let's divide the money equally and end the game here.\n\n### (If I were to reject, my next offer would be {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A little more for me!""})\n\n### But since 50/50 is a fair offer, I will accept it.\n\n### Game Over!\n\n### (If you want to simulate another round, feel free to let me know!)"
