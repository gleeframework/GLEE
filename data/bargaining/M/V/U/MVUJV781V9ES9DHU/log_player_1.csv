"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll get $4,000, which is equivalent to $4,200 in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $6,000 is equivalent to $4,800 in the first round.

Considering the inflation effect, I think I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
