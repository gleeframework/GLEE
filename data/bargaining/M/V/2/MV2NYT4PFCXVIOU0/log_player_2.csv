Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll reduce my share a bit, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor and the inflation is eating away at her potential gains faster.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""This seems like a fair compromise, Alice.  Every round that passes makes the deal worse for both of us, especially you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get more. Inflation is hurting me more than you 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting close, but I need to hold out a little longer. Alice is acknowledging the impact of inflation, which means she's getting desperate.  She'll likely offer a much better deal in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is the best offer you'll get.  We're running out of time, and the inflation is only getting worse.""}
