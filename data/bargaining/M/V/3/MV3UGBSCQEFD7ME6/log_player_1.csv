"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI propose that I, Alice, receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this proposal or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This round only! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, and considering that the value for Bob decreases with each round, I will reject this offer in anticipation of a potentially better deal in the next round or making a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn to relay the message to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation on Bob's valuation of the money, where each round decreases the value by 10%, I will make an offer that slightly adjusts from my initial proposal but still leans in my favor, given the decreasing value for Bob.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI've proposed that I, Alice, receive $650,000 and Bob receives $350,000, with a message suggesting this adjustment takes into account the inflation factor affecting Bob's valuation. It's now Bob's turn to decide on this proposal.\n\n###\n\nYour turn to relay the message to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Time is literally money, and we're both losing out. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that the money's value remains constant for me but continues to decrease for Bob, and considering Bob's message that this is his final offer, I must weigh the potential benefits of holding out further against the risk of not reaching an agreement and the relatively favorable terms I'm being offered, especially since my gain is higher than what Bob offered previously and Bob's gain is significantly less valuable due to inflation.\n\nHowever, since the terms are somewhat favorable and considering the risk of further negotiation, I'll decide to accept this offer to secure a significant amount without risking further negotiations that may not yield a better outcome for me.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my acceptance to Bob to conclude the game."
