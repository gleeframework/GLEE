"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split. Don't wait, the money is losing value!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and hoping he'll accept it before the money loses more value. Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not waste time with more rounds. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I think I can get a better deal. Since the money loses value for Bob with each round, I'm hoping he'll be more willing to compromise in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer and message in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""You're losing value with each round, don't wait! This is a better deal than you'll get next time.""
}
```

I'm taking advantage of the fact that the money is losing value for Bob, so I'm offering him a smaller share this time. I'm trying to put some pressure on him to accept, as the deal will likely only get worse for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and we both lose if this keeps going.  This is my final offer. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is reasonable at this point, and I'm not sure I can get a much better deal. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I'm happy to accept $550,000. Additionally, Bob's message implies that he's not willing to continue negotiating, so I don't want to risk him walking away or making an even worse offer in the next round. It's time to close the deal!"
