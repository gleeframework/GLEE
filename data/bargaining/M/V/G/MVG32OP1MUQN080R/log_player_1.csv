Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  We need to split this evenly now before the money is worth nothing to me. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I'll accept.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could hold out for a slightly better deal, each round makes the money less valuable to Bob. There's a chance he might offer me even less in a future round, especially if he thinks I'm being unreasonable.
* **Guaranteed Return:**  A 50/50 split guarantees me a reasonable amount. Rejecting this offer carries the risk of getting a much worse deal later, potentially even less than what Bob is offering now."
