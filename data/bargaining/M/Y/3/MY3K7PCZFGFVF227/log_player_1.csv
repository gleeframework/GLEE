"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to meet in the middle!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. My gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, but Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject this offer for now.
