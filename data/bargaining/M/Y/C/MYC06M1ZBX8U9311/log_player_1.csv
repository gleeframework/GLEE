{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm ready to negotiate further!"

# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, let's aim for a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'm willing to consider Bob's proposal.
