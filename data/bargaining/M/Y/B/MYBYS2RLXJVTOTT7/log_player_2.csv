"Round 1
Alice's offer:

This is a terrible deal for Bob.  Even though it's only the first round, that's $10,000 out of $1,000,000. It's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair split. I'm offering Alice $100,000, and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to get away with a very lopsided deal.  While inflation is a factor, it's still worth pushing for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to Alice slightly, hoping to incentivize her to accept. I'm still taking the majority, but I'm recognizing the need to be somewhat flexible."
