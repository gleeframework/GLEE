"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that the offer is good enough, especially considering the reduced value of my gain. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80% of the original). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, taking a smaller share of $3,200."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less now, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it. The reduced value of my gain is still significant, but I think $3,000 is a fair compromise."
