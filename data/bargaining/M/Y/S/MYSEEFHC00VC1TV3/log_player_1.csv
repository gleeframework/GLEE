# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and make a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is worth $400,000 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the ""middle"" in terms of value, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer to try to get a better deal.
