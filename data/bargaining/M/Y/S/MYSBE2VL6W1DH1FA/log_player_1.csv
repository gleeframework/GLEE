Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This leaves a lot for Bob, but I want to start with a generous offer to see if he'll accept. I'll then adjust my offers based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point. Inflation has already reduced my potential earnings, and if I reject, the next round will further decrease my potential gain.  It's time to secure some of the money."
