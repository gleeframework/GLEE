"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take the lion's share, but I'll give you a small token of appreciation for being a good sport.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 10%. The message is a friendly jab to set the tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway and let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money is worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 50% of the remaining value. I'll try to do better than that.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more attractive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this round, but don't think you're getting the better deal yet!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the remaining value, leaving Bob with 20%. The message is a warning to Bob that I'm not getting desperate yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit greedy, Alice! I'll give you a smaller share this round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I suppose I was being a bit greedy. This offer isn't bad, considering the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as the remaining value is still substantial, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting it."
