Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I'm taking a slightly larger share, but I think it's still fair considering Alice got a generous portion last round.  Let's see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 680000 
# Alice gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Although the money is worth less due to inflation, Alice's offer is still better than my previous proposal.  I'll take it!"
