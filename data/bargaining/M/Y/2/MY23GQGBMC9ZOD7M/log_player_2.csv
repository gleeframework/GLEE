"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept a 3:1 split in the first round! While inflation is a concern, it's not worth giving up 75% of the money right away. Let's see what kind of offer Alice makes in the next round."
