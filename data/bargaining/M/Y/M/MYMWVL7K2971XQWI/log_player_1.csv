"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll be generous!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original 100$ and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 45% is a good deal for me, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more equitable offer."
