"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, given the inflation we'll both face. Let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I think Bob's offer is a decent one.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of 45% for me and 55% for him. It's not my ideal split, but it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
