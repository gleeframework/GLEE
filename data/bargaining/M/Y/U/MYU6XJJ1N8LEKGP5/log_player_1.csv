"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping 80% of the money and giving Bob 20%, which is a relatively fair split for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's the most logical starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the new values are:

Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
Bob gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
