Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more balanced split is possible. Since we both lose value on the money, I'm proposing a split that reflects a smaller disparity in our losses. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
