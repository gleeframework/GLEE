"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but I'm open to negotiating in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: In this game, I should reject the first offer from Alice because it is highly unequal and I have 11 more rounds to negotiate a better deal. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me each round, I need to balance the need to reach an agreement with the need to get a fair share. Given that Alice's offer leaves me with only 10% of the money, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. Additionally, accepting such a low offer at the start sets a bad precedent and may lead to further unequal proposals from Alice. By rejecting this offer, I signal to Alice that I expect a more equitable division of the money."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Given the inflation, I'm willing to accept a bit less than half, but I expect a more reasonable split than your initial offer.""}"
