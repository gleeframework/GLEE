Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. Given the inflation, I'm willing to accept a bit less than half, but I expect a more reasonable split than your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
