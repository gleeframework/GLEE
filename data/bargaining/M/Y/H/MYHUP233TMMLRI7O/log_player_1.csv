"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the proposal this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than 50% of the original $10,000. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and keeping the game going to see if I can get an even better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I think I should get a slightly larger share considering the inflation is affecting me more than Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite each round!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me less than 50% of the original $10,000. I'll think about it...

However, I notice that the inflation is affecting Bob more significantly, and he's trying to compensate for that. I'll take a closer look at the numbers...

After reevaluating, I'll accept Bob's offer.
