Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that.  This offer is still fair. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this soon. I'm increasing my offer for you to consider. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still not advantageous for me. The longer the game goes, the more my potential earnings shrink. It's time to push for a more significant gain before inflation eats away at the value too much."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. We both need to benefit, and this is the best way to ensure that happens before inflation makes it pointless.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show flexibility but holding firm on a 58/42 split.  This makes it clear I'm serious about getting a deal done *this* round but won't accept a bad deal. Bob needs to understand the time pressure is working against me more than him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob has finally moved to a 50/50 split. Given the rapidly increasing inflation, waiting any longer will likely result in me getting even less. It's time to cut my losses and accept this offer."
