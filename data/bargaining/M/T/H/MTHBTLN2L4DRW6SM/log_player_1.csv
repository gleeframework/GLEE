"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 300k. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slightly larger share this time, but I believe this is a fair deal. Let's settle this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, the money is worth less than before, and I'd like to maximize my share. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine in the first round, and I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increased inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take 450k and let's move on.""
}
```"
