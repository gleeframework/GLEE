"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money 80/20 in my favor, given the inflation rate and the fact that we'll be playing for longer if we don't agree. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
