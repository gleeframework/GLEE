"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I am the one making the offer. This leaves a significant margin for negotiation and ensures both players have a reasonable stake."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation factor makes it difficult to demand a larger sum. Accepting this offer ensures I receive at least some money and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
