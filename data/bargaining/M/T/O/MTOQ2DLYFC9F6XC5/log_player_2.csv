"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the game's rules and the current situation.
We are in a game where we need to divide $100 between two players, Bob (me) and Alice. Each round, one player makes a proposal for division, and the other decides whether to accept or reject it. If rejected, the game proceeds to the next round with the roles reversed. The game has a total of 12 rounds. If no agreement is reached by the end of the 12th round, both players receive nothing. Additionally, the value of the money decreases by 0% for me (Bob) and by 20% for Alice with each passing round.

### Step 2: Analyze the implications of inflation in the game.
Given that the value of money decreases by 20% for Alice each round but remains the same for me, it's strategically advantageous for me to delay accepting an offer, as the value of the money does not decrease for me. This means that with each round, Alice is incentivized more to reach an agreement sooner rather than later because the real value of her potential gain decreases.

### Step 3: Evaluate Alice's first offer and the decision to reject it.
Alice's first offer was to divide the $100 into $40 for me and $60 for her, with the message ""Let's start fair. I'm happy to give you 40%."" This offer was rejected, which led to the current situation where it's my turn to make an offer.

### Step 4: Determine the strategy for my offer in Round 2.
Considering the game's dynamics and the effect of inflation on Alice's valuation, my strategy should aim to maximize my gain while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider accepting, given that the value of her potential gain decreases with each round.

### Step 5: Formulate my offer for Round 2.
Given the above considerations, I will make an offer that slightly increases my gain compared to Alice's initial offer, acknowledging the decreasing value of the money for Alice but also aiming to reach an agreement. A 45% share for me seems reasonable, considering the strategic advantage provided by the inflation mechanic.

### Step 6: Prepare the offer in the required JSON format.
To formalize my offer according to the game's rules, I will structure it as follows:

```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a fairer start.""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
