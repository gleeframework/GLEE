"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair and square deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my thinking considering the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to decide based on the relative values.

My current offer was $6,000, which is now worth 90% of its original value due to inflation. So, in this round, I would have gotten $5,400 if I accepted my original offer.

Bob's offer is $5,000, which is 90% of its original value, and $5,000 for Bob, which is 95% of its original value.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer seems more attractive to me now. I'll accept his offer.
