# Alice's message: Don't bluff, compromise! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her offer, trying to pressure me as we get closer to the deadline. I'm going to call her bluff and see if she's willing to risk losing everything in the later rounds.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share, but I'll be more flexible next round if needed."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, meet me here? 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to significantly eat into the potential winnings. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 44/56 split at this point is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree in the remaining rounds."
