"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair deal, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, this split is more balanced. Accept and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I need to be careful!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Since I'm not getting as much as I initially wanted, I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject the offer for now. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting enough, I want more!""
}
```

It's my turn to make the next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%). I need to make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need more!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $540,000 and Bob gets $460,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
