"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking what I deserve. Accept this and we can avoid more inflation. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 95/5.  We both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Accept it and we can avoid more losses.  Reject it, and we both risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  Inflation is hurting me significantly, and there's a high risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting.  At least I'm getting something, and it's better than nothing."
