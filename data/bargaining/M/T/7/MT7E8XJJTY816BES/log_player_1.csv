"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message that suggests this is a relatively fair split, considering I'm taking on the risk of the game potentially going multiple rounds and the value of the money decreasing. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I'd be getting $45 that's worth 20% less than in the first round, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I've considered your offer, but I think this is more fair, considering the decreasing value""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $42 and taking $58 for myself. Given that the money's value is decreasing, I believe this split is relatively fair, taking into account that the value of the money I receive decreases faster than Bob's. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  The value is decreasing rapidly, let's settle before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. Getting $48 now is better than potentially getting an even worse deal in the next round. It's time to settle and take the offer!"
