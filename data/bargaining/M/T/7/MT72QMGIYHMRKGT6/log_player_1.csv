"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still a fair share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'll have to be careful not to lose out.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not too happy about the uneven split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split in my favor, while still keeping it relatively close. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer seems less appealing than it did in the previous round. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split, especially when the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to push the split further in my favor, considering the continued inflation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer seems more appealing now, as the value of the money he's offering is significantly reduced. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 58/42 is a reasonable split, given the circumstances, and I'm willing to accept it to end the game."
