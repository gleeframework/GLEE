Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is your last chance for a good deal! I'm taking $65, leaving you with $35.  It's only going to get worse for you if we keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit from inflation, and you're not budging. $45 is the best you'll get at this point - take it before it gets worse for both of us!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this. $60 for me, $40 for you.  The longer we wait, the worse this deal gets for you. Don't be stubborn! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer of $40 is the best move to prevent further losses.
