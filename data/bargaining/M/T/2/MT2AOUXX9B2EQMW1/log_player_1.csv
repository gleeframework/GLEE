I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a big offer, but I want to secure a good chunk of the money early on.  It's risky to go for a 50/50 split right away because I don't know how Bob is going to react to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something, I am still in a better position to negotiate since I'm still the one making the offer in the next round. I'll see if I can get a better deal, especially since inflation will impact Bob's offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor. I'm reducing my share a little bit but still keeping a significant portion. I'm hoping that this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept.  The inflation will be a bigger factor in his decision, and this offer is still significantly better than what he offered me in the last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer again.  Bob's offer is getting closer to 50/50, but it's still too far off from what I think I can get. I still have a few rounds to go before inflation really starts to hurt, and I believe I can do better than this.  I'll keep trying to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but still keeping a significant portion. I'm aiming to find a balance between getting a good amount of money and not pushing Bob to completely reject my offer. It's a risk, but I think the inflation will be a more significant factor for Bob in his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Inflation is starting to hurt my potential gains significantly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances, and I'm happy to secure half of the money."
