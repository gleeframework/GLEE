"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is designed to be incredibly lopsided in my favor, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept even a tiny amount rather than risk getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to take the guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
