"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk further inflation. I'll reject this and see what Bob comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower amount, aiming for a compromise but still keeping a larger share for myself, as I'm aware of the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 514000 
# Bob gain: 486000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, this offer is still better than the previous round.  Accepting guarantees a share, and further rounds might lead to an even lower offer."
