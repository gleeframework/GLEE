"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but it's still a decent offer""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, and I think I can do better than 40%. I'll let Bob know that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer. This is my last chance to make a decent deal""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's rejected proposal. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept it."
