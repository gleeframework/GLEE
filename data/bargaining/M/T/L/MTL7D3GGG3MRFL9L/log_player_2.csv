It's early in the game, and I don't want to settle for such a small share. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is better than the first round, it's still significantly less than a fair split. I want to see if I can push for a more equitable distribution."
