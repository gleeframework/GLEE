"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'm effectively getting $5,400 (6000 * 0.9) if I accept this offer. Bob is getting $6,500 (7000 * 0.95).

I'm not sure I like this offer, as it's still skewed towards Bob's favor. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'm effectively getting $4,860 (5400 * 0.9) if I accept this offer.

I'll make a new offer that's more balanced:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 45-55!""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to be fair, let's split it 50-50! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'm effectively getting $3,636 (6000 * 0.607) if I accept this offer. Bob is getting $3,636 (6000 * 0.607).

I think this offer is a good one, and it's a 50-50 split, which is fair. I'll accept it.
