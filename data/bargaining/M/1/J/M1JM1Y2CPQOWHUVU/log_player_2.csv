"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since the money devalues faster for you, this deal benefits both of us in the long run.""}
