"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message suggesting a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, given the money is losing value for me each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation is affecting Bob's gain, so he may be willing to compromise more in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In my offer, I'll take into account the fact that the money is losing value for Bob each round. I'll offer him a bit more than last time, but still try to get a good deal for myself. Here's my proposal:
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split""}\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
