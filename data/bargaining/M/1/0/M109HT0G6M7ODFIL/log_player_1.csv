"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair but reasonable split in the first round. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he'll accept a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, given the inflation and the possibility of getting nothing in the next round, I think it's best to accept this offer."
