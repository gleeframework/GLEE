"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

 I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives Bob a small amount, but hopefully, he'll be willing to take it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is much lower than my initial proposal, it's still better than what I'd get if I reject and risk getting nothing in the next round. The inflation makes the money worth less with each round, so I'll take what I can get."
