I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure a slightly larger share is fair, as I'm taking the initiative in the first round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the inflation. I'll accept."
