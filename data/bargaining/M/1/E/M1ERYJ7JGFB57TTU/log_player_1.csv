Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting greedier, and the inflation is starting to hurt. While accepting would give me something, it's becoming clear Bob is unlikely to offer anything near a fair split. I'm willing to risk another round to try and get him closer to 50/50."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but this is getting ridiculous.  I'm willing to meet you slightly above the middle to end this now. Don't be greedy!""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aiming for a larger share and is willing to risk inflation.  By offering him slightly more than half, I'm hoping to appeal to his desire to end the game quickly while still securing a decent amount for myself. It's a calculated risk, but the alternative is likely a worse offer in the next round."
