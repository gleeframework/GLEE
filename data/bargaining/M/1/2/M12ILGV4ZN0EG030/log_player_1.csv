Bob's offer is getting better for him, but it's still not good for me.  I need to hold out for a better deal, especially as the pressure is on him with the decreasing value."

``` 

This is a tough one, but I still need to reject.  While time is running out, Bob's offer is actually getting worse for me than his earlier ones.  He's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and making a last-ditch attempt to secure a larger share.  I need to gamble that he'll be more desperate in the next round."
