Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure Bob might accept this in the first round, as he doesn't know about the inflation yet. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a fair split, and since the money I gain is worth less than the first round, I'll accept it. It's better to get 50% of the money than risk getting nothing!"
