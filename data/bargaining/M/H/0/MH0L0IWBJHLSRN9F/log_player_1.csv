"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'll negotiate more if you decline!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more fairly.  I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I also need to make sure I get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'd rather get more, but Bob's offer is a decent compromise. I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
