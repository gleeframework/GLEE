"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money now, but you'll get a chance to propose in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While I could use the $1,000, I want to see if I can get a better deal later.  It's worth the risk to see what Alice will offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering we have 11 rounds left and inflation will start to impact my share.  Let's work together to make sure we both get something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic. Inflation is going to hurt you more than me.  I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time, but I need to make sure I get the lion's share before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While Alice's message is correct about inflation, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  With 10 rounds left, there's still a lot of time for me to negotiate a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is going to hurt both of us, and I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get a decent share before the value drops too much.""}
