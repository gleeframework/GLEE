Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, inflation is killing your share 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While this offer is still unfavorable to Bob, with each passing round, the inflation makes it increasingly difficult to secure a better deal. Accepting this offer guarantees Bob at least some money, whereas rejecting could lead to getting nothing at all."
