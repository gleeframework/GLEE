"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion, but I'm hoping we can negotiate a better deal later.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively small offer to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially better deals in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give away too much. Let's see if you're willing to make a better offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the effects of inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, which means I'm effectively getting $32.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not happy with the 60% for you, I think I can do better than that. Let's see if you can be more generous.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, which means I'm effectively getting 26.4% of the original $100 (32 * 0.8). I'll aim to increase my share in this round.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give in yet. I think we can do better than this. Let's try to find a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the effects of inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means I'm effectively getting 51.2% of the original $100 (80 * 0.64). I'm actually getting a better deal than I initially thought.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a fair offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I think we've negotiated a good deal. 50-50 seems fair, considering the inflation.""
}
