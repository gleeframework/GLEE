"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slightly larger share this round""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm being generous, but I want to set the tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging this time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll have to think carefully about it. With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'm effectively getting $5,500 (3000 / 0.9). Bob, on the other hand, is getting $7,000, which is effectively $5,600 for him (7000 / 0.8).

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time, and split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a more equal split and accept this offer."
