"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, with a message ""Let's be fair!"" to convey a sense of reasonableness and cooperation. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to start with a slightly higher offer for myself to account for the potential loss in future rounds. This also gives Bob an incentive to accept early and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I need to consider the decreased value when evaluating Bob's offer. With this in mind, Bob's offer of $45 for me is actually worth less than face value due to inflation. Considering the original amount was $100 and I initially offered a division that was slightly in my favor, I believe we can still negotiate for a more favorable split. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to either get a better deal or make an offer that Bob can't refuse.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll consider the impact of inflation again, as the money is now worth 10% less for me than in the first round. Given that Bob's previous offer was not acceptable and the decreasing value of the money for me, I will adjust my offer to try and find a middle ground while still being mindful of the inflation. I'll offer $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, trying to appear more flexible and willing to compromise, while also emphasizing the urgency due to the inflation affecting my share.\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}"
