"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting off by offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount, hoping to encourage him to accept in the first round.  I'm assuming that since the money loses value faster for him, he might be more inclined to take what he can get early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very tempting, but I'm going to reject it.  I'm hoping he will see the value of getting at least some money early on. Even though the money is worth less to him, I'm betting he'll be more motivated to make a deal in the next round since his money is losing value faster."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping a larger portion for myself. I think Bob is starting to understand that we need to reach a compromise, and that his offer in the previous round was too aggressive. I'm hoping to find a middle ground in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too greedy, and I'm not willing to accept such a low share. While his money is losing value quickly, mine is still worth the same. I'm going to keep pushing for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a significant portion of the money.  It's becoming clear that we need to reach a compromise quickly, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's demands just yet. The rate of inflation is working in my favor, and I'm hoping to leverage that to get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, but I'm confident that I can get a bigger share if I continue to hold out.  The inflation is hurting him more than it's hurting me, and I'm going to keep pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that the longer we wait, the less money we will both receive due to inflation. This offer is a fair compromise considering the rapid decline in the value of his share. I believe this is a good deal for both of us and a step in the right direction to avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more reasonable. While it's still not ideal, the inflation is hitting him hard. Accepting this offer means we both get something, and with only 4 rounds left, I'm worried we might both end up with nothing.  It's time to take what I can get and cut my losses."
