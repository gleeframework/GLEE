Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept. I want to ensure a quick resolution, but I'm also aware of the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation rate makes this a good deal. Accepting ensures I get something, and the next round would only decrease my share further."
