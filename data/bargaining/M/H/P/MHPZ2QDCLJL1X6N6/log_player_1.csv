"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 55:45, a fair starting point""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 45%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 55:45, I'll give you 60:40, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can do better, huh?

Considering the new values due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob can do better, but I'm willing to give him the chance to try. I'll reject this offer and let him make another proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50:50, no more negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, which seems fair considering the previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
