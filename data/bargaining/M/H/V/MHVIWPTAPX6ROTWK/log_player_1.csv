"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 400,000 and Bob takes 600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, I'll try to do better 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is significantly better than my original proposal. However, I'm willing to consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'm keeping an eye on the negotiations. If Bob can do better, I'd be happy to revisit the proposal.
