"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'll be getting the larger share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious with my decision.

Since Bob's offer is 50-50, it seems like a fair split, considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
