I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll be tempted to accept it early on. After all, his money is losing value faster than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While the money I get is worth less with each round, I know Bob's money is losing value twice as fast. I'm going to keep pushing for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm still going to try to get a larger share, but I'm also going to be a little more reasonable. This time I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, while still keeping the majority for myself. I'm hoping he'll be tempted to accept it, as his money is depreciating at a much faster rate."
