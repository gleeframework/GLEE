"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to try to get him to accept quickly and avoid the effects of inflation. My message is a friendly one, trying to persuade him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less now.

I'll reject this offer because it's not beneficial for me. The 50/50 split is not enough considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""Don't wait for a better offer, take this and get your share!""
}
```

My offer is a bit more generous than the previous one, but still trying to get Bob to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better offer, but don't expect it to last! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer. 700,000 is a decent amount, and it's better than what I would get if we continue playing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
