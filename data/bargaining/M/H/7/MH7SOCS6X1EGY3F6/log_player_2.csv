Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly less favorable deal than she offered me, hoping she'll accept it to avoid the risk of further rounds and inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer considering the inflation and the risk of further rounds.  It's better than getting 36% less if we go to the next round."
