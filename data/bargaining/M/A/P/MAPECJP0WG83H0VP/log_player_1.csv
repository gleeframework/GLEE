# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob taking the majority, I'll have to think carefully. Considering the inflation, I'll try to maximize my gain. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept this offer.
