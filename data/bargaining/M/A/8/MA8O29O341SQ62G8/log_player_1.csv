"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 95 dollars for myself and give 5 dollars to Bob. This is a fair initial offer as it gives Bob some money and allows for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, I think it's wise to accept this offer.  The inflation factor means that my 70 dollars will be worth less in the future, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing."
