"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the impact of inflation on the game.
Inflation affects Bob's gain, reducing its value by 5% each round, but it does not affect Alice's gain. This means that with each passing round, Bob is incentivized to reach an agreement sooner rather than later because the value of his potential gain decreases.

### Step 2: Analyze the previous offers and their implications.
In Round 1, Alice offered a 60-40 split, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered a 45-55 split, considering the inflation, which Alice rejected. Given the rejection, Alice should now consider offering a split that is slightly more favorable to Bob than her initial offer but still advantageous to her, considering the inflationary pressure on Bob.

### Step 3: Calculate a reasonable offer that considers the inflation and previous rejections.
Given that Bob's money is worth 5% less each round, and we are in Round 3, Bob's gain is now worth 10% less than at the start (5% less in Round 2, and another 5% less in Round 3). Alice should make an offer that acknowledges this but still benefits her. A split that slightly favors Bob more than the initial offer but less than Bob's offer might be acceptable.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer and message.
Considering the above, Alice could offer a split that is closer to 50-50 but slightly favors her, acknowledging Bob's decreasing value but also the need for compromise. A message explaining the rationale could accompany this offer.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground.""}"
