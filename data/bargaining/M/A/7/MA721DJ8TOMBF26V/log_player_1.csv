I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, hoping Bob will accept. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the 20% inflation makes this a good deal for me.  I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Bob, but he seems to be getting more aggressive in his offers. It's better to accept now and secure my gains."
