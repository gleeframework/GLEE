While this offer is decent, there's a lot of money at stake and 12 rounds to potentially get a better deal.  Let's see if Alice will budge."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair split. This will give us both a good amount of money to start with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is starting to budge. This is a good offer considering the inflation, and it's getting closer to the 50/50 split. It's a good risk-reward decision to accept this."
