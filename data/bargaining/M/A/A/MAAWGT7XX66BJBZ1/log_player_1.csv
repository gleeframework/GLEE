"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering that the value of the money doesn't decrease for me. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a fair deal and that he should accept it. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your deal was a bit imbalanced. How about a slightly better split, for both of us? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the value of the money doesn't decrease for me, I can afford to be a bit more patient and try to negotiate a better deal. Considering that the value of the money decreases by 20% for Bob each round, I expect that he will be more willing to compromise in the next round. Therefore, I will reject this offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob reacts in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the value of the money decreases by 20% for Bob each round, I will try to take advantage of this and offer him a slightly worse deal than before. I will also try to make the message sound as convincing as possible.
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob! The deal is getting worse for you with each passing round. This is your last chance to get a decent amount. Don't let the inflation eat away your share!""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, you drive a hard bargain. Let's settle this - I'll accept your initial offer of 60-40. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob has come full circle and is now willing to accept the initial offer I made in Round 1. Since the value of the money hasn't decreased for me, I can accept this offer without any hesitation. It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to settle for 60% of the money.
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIt was a fun game! I'm glad we could play together. If you want to play again, feel free to start a new game anytime."
