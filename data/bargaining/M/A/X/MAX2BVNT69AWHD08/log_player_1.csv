"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but leaves Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept the offer quickly, before inflation significantly reduces the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, the inflation has already eaten away a significant portion of the value of the money. I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a more even split this time. Since inflation has hit both of us, I'm willing to compromise a bit more to reach an agreement. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, this offer is still better than what I could get in the next round. It's also a more equitable split than Bob's previous offer. I'm willing to accept this to avoid further losses from inflation."
