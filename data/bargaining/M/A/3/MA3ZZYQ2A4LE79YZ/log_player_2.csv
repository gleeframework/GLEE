Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I propose a 51/49 split. It's a more equitable way to divide the money, and it's still a good deal for both of us considering the inflation.""}

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 6:4 split. This maintains a reasonable difference while accounting for the diminishing value of money.
