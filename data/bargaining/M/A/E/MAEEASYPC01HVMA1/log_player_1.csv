"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I would get $100,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob would get $900,000, which is 10% less than his initial share in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, I'll try to balance the shares a bit more. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer in the first round, taking into account the 27.1% inflation.

Initial value of Bob's share: $200,000
Inflation: 27.1%
Effective value of Bob's share: $200,000 / (1 - 0.271) = $273,636.36

With this in mind, Bob's offer in the current round is equivalent to about 1,459,545 in the first round, which is a significant increase from his previous offer.

I'll accept this offer.
