Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer.  I'll take 65%, and you can have the remaining 35%.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the money is losing value quickly, accepting a 35/65 split leaves a significant amount of potential money on the table.  Alice is clearly aiming for the lion's share, but her offers haven't budged dramatically. I'm betting she'll become more willing to compromise as the rounds progress and she sees I'm not backing down easily."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop this dance.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to resolve this. Take it now, or watch your potential winnings dwindle with every passing second.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to send a strong signal. A 50/50 split is the most logical outcome and emphasizes fairness.  While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer underscores that I'm not desperate and prepared to walk away if necessary. The pressure is on Alice to recognize a good deal before time runs out."
