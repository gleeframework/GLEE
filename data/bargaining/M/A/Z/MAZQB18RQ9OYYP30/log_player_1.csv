"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I get to make the first offer.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the risk of having my offer rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a 60/40 split, due to inflation, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. My 40$ is worth less than it was in the previous round, but it's still a better outcome than risking further inflation and ending up with even less."
