"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $300,000. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a 30% share of the initial $1,000,000. This leaves me with $700,000, which is a 70% share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a fair split is 700k for me and 300k for you.  Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, especially since the money is worth 20% less than it was in the first round. I'd like to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% less in each of the two previous rounds), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll offer you $400,000. It's a fair split considering the reduced value of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the current value of the money. This leaves me with $600,000, which is a 60% share. I hope Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and take 600k.  This way we both get something, even with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise.

However, I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, even with the reduced value of the money. I'd like to make a new offer that takes into account the continued inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 69.2% less due to inflation (20% less in each of the four previous rounds), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation, I'll offer you $460,000. It's the best I can do to try to get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000, which is a 46% share of the current value of the money. This leaves me with $540,000, which is a 54% share. I hope Bob will accept this offer!"
