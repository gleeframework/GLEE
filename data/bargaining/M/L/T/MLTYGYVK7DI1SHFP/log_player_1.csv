I'm going to try and get as much as possible in the first round, as the inflation will hurt Bob more than me. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'll accept this offer. Although I get significantly less, the inflation would make the next round much worse for me, and I'm not sure I'd be able to get a better deal."
