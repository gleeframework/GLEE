"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a good deal 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough spot, as the inflation is really hurting Bob. However, accepting $40 when the original offer was $45 is a bad trajectory. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  It's a gamble, but Bob needs to hold out hope for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""The inflation is making this difficult. Let's split it evenly and avoid losing any more.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know inflation is hurting you, but I'm not feeling the pinch, so I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** The inflation is really hurting, but Alice is clearly just trying to bleed Bob dry.  There's a real risk Bob gets nothing if this continues, but accepting $38 sets a terrible precedent. A 50/50 split was already offered and rejected. It's time to play hardball and hope Alice starts taking the deadline seriously."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is non-negotiable.  Take it or leave it. We both lose if this goes on longer.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is incredibly frustrating, but accepting $35 would be a huge loss. Alice is clearly betting on Bob cracking under pressure. With 3 rounds left, Bob needs to hold his ground. There's still a chance Alice will break and accept a less lopsided deal, especially as getting nothing is a real possibility for her now too."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. We both lose out if you reject this. Don't be greedy, Alice.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not being greedy, I'm being patient. You're the one who's desperate 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is agonizing! $30 is a pittance compared to what Bob could have had.  But Alice is clearly relishing her position of power and is unlikely to offer anything remotely reasonable now.  There are only two rounds left. Accepting here would be admitting defeat and letting Alice walk all over Bob.  It's a huge risk, but there's a tiny sliver of hope that Alice will panic at the last second if Bob holds strong."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We both get NOTHING if you reject this.  I'm being more than fair considering the circumstances.  Don't let pride make you throw away free money!""} 

**Reasoning:**  It's the final round.  Bob has to make his last stand.  Dropping to $40 for Bob is a bitter pill, but it's the highest offer Alice has seen from him. The message stresses the very real possibility of getting nothing, appealing to Alice's rational side.  There's no guarantee, but this is Bob's best shot at salvaging something from this negotiation."
