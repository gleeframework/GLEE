Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money, but leaves Bob with a small amount. This is to see if he's willing to accept a relatively unfair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a terrible deal for me, even with inflation. I'll reject and try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, hoping to reach a compromise.  While I still want a larger share, this offer is more fair than the last round."
