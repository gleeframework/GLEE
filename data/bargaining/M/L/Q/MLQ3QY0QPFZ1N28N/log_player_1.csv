Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, Alice.  We both get a fair share before the value drops. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly again, Alice.  The value is dropping for both of us, and this is the fairest solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the nominal split is even, the decreasing value of the money makes this a bad deal for me (Alice). Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation by framing it as ""fair"" while he's losing less value with each passing round. I need to incentivize him to accept a deal that gives me a larger share before the value drops too much for him."
