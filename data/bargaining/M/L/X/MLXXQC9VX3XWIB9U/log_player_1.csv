"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

This is a classic ultimatum game, and I'm starting with a very high offer for myself (Alice) with the hope that Bob will be happy with a small share and accept in the first round. If he doesn't, I'll need to reconsider my strategy in the subsequent rounds, taking into account the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money Bob gains, it still offers him a substantial amount.  I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds to potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, aiming for a more balanced split. This reflects that I'm starting to recognize the need to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money."
