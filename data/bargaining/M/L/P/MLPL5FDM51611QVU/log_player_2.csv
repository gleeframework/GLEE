**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me.  While time is ticking, accepting an offer below a 50/50 split, even considering inflation, sets a bad precedent for future negotiations. I need to show her I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."

# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting bolder, but I can't afford to panic. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss, even accounting for inflation. I need to hold firm and counter with an offer that reflects the urgency of the situation while still being advantageous to me."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We both lose if this fails.

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but time is running out. Alice clearly knows she has the upper hand. If I reject this, the next offer might be even worse, and I risk getting nothing at all. Accepting this offer cuts my losses and still gives me something."
