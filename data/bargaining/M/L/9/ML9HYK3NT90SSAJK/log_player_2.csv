"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to share most of the money with you, Bob. This is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as we go.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  This offer gives you a good share, and it's fairer than your last proposal.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to lowball me after my generous offer.  While the effects of inflation are starting to bite, holding out for a better deal is still the best strategy. Accepting 30% now would be a significant loss compared to what I could potentially gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's end this now with a perfectly fair 50/50 split. Anything less is unacceptable. ""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Inflation is eroding our potential gains with each passing round. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge from a position that favors her significantly. A firm 50/50 offer emphasizes the need for fairness and puts pressure on her to accept before inflation eats away at the value of the money even further."
