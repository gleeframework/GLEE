Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? This seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is better than what I'd get if I reject and we go to round 3 (due to inflation). However, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  I'm going to take a gamble and hope he's willing to negotiate more fairly.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's compromise. This offer is closer to the middle ground while still acknowledging the time pressure and inflation we're facing.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is ticking, Alice. This offer is a good compromise, and it benefits us both to settle sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer:

* **Current Value to Alice:** $5200 is worth only 72.9% due to inflation, making the actual value $3790.80.
* **Potential Value in Round 5:** If I reject, the most I can hope for in the next round is $5700 (my last offer) with 34.39% inflation, resulting in a value of $3753. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the potential gains decrease significantly for me. Delaying further is risky. 

Bob is clearly using time pressure to his advantage. While his offer isn't ideal, it's slightly better than what I might get in the next round after inflation.
