"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it 90/10, with me taking the bigger share this time. It's only fair, since I rejected your offer in the last round. Let's be reasonable and end this now. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
