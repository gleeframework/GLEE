"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take 65% and you take 35%.  It's your turn next, so think about what you want! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with the 65-35 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45, let's end this""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and end the game, offering a 55-45 split."
