"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the pizza!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the pizza part of the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation in mind, I need to consider that Bob's offer is actually worth 20% less than it seems.

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

Bob's gain: 50
Effective value of Bob's gain: 50 / 0.8 = 62.5

This means Bob's offer is actually worth $62.50, which is more than my initial offer of $60. However, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation effect.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was worth more than my initial offer, I'll try to be more aggressive this time around. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Still trying to meet in the middle, but a bit more towards me this time! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer, taking into account the inflation rate of 48.8%:

Bob's gain: 45
Effective value of Bob's gain: 45 / (1 - 0.488) = 45 / 0.512 = 87.89

This means Bob's offer is actually worth approximately $87.89, which is still less than my initial offer of $100, but more than my previous offer of $70. Considering the inflation, I think this is a good opportunity to accept and get a decent share.
