Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I'm feeling generous. 700k for me, 300k for you. This is a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer might seem tempting, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing for me, not for him. Holding out for a better deal in the next round is the more strategic move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Don't be greedy, Bob. This is my final offer.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split is the most logical outcome. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a tough one! While a 50/50 split seemed unfair in earlier rounds, the impact of inflation is becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting a lower offer now is better than risking an even worse outcome in future rounds."
