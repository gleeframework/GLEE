I'm going to be greedy in the first round, hoping Bob will accept a small share.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the first round, but it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject this and try to get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is working in my favor, so I'll see if I can leverage that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share than in the first round, hoping that the inflation will make this more appealing to him. Since he rejected my first offer and then offered me a much smaller share, I'm assuming he's more focused on getting a larger share, even if it means a slightly smaller gain.  Let's see if this works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept. Inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round.  This offer is still significantly less than what I offered in the first round, but given the losses due to inflation, it's the best I can do at this point."
