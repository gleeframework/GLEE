Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but the longer the game goes on, the more I lose due to inflation. While 40 is much lower than I'd like, rejecting this offer means risking even less in future rounds."
