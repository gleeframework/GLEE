Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fair, but slightly advantageous offer for myself. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  This gives me a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will accept since he's getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  The money is depreciating quickly and Bob has made a significant move in his favor.  If I reject, I'll have to make an offer next round, and the money I gain will be worth even less.  This deal still nets me a decent amount, and it's better to take what I can get."
