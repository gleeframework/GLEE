"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share to account for potential future inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob taking a larger share this round, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to increase my share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still eating away at the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to increase my share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance this round. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to give up too much ground yet. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'm still not getting the share I want, but I'm getting closer to the middle ground. Considering the inflation is eating away at the money, I'll think it's better to accept this offer and try to negotiate further in the next round.
