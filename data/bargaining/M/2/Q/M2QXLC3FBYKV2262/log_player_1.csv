"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this offer is fair, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bigger portion due to the initial proposal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and still getting a decent amount myself, considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the lowest I can go without getting too little. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm getting a bit desperate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I can do better than this offer, but I'd rather not settle for this. I'm hoping Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,

}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being realistic about the value of the money."
