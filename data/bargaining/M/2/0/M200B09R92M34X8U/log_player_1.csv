"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share and avoid any further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, Bob's offer is more attractive. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an even split, as I think I can do better. I'll wait for a new offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of money, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise""
}
```"
