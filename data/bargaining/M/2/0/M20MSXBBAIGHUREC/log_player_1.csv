I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10.  I think this is a fair offer because I am the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm willing to lower my share slightly to $80, but I still think this is a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 20

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my share again to $70, but I'm starting to feel like we're going to be stuck in a stalemate if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, it seems like Bob is going to keep offering the same 70/30 split.  I'll accept this offer to avoid any further rounds."
