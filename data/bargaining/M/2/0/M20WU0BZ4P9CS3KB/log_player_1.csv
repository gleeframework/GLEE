"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 99.9% share for myself, leaving 1,000 for Bob. While this might seem aggressive, it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate, or if he'll push for a more even split. Remember, with each passing round, the value of the money decreases, so I need to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this is a much more even split than my initial offer, it's still not a favorable deal for me, considering that Bob is getting a larger share while the value of my share remains the same. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm willing to increase my offer to 700,000 for myself, leaving 300,000 for Bob. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair offer considering the risk of inflation. If Bob rejects this, we risk losing a considerable amount of value in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is now proposing a more even split, the decrease in value of his offer due to inflation makes it still unfavorable for me. His share is now worth less than in the first round, while my share remains the same. I'll continue to hold out for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm raising my offer again to 800,000 for myself, leaving 200,000 for Bob. This is a significant step towards meeting Bob halfway. It's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing with each passing round, and I need to secure a fair deal before it becomes too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable.  Even though his share has grown, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of his offer, making it less appealing. I'll continue to negotiate for a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm making a final push for a favorable deal. I'm offering Bob 100,000, which is significantly less than his previous offers, but with the inflation, the actual value of his offer is much lower. I'm hoping he'll accept this to avoid risking both of us getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still decreasing in value due to inflation, this is the closest we've gotten to a 50/50 split. The risk of losing everything in the next rounds is high, and an even split seems like the best option to secure at least half the remaining value."
