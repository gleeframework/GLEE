70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30.  It's important to settle this early as the value decreases with each round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I think it's fair to split the money more evenly.  Let's each take 60 and 40 respectively.  We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate if you'd like.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'll take $65, and you get $35. Remember, the value decreases each round, especially for you. It's a fair deal!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 55 for me and 45 for you. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before the value of the money drops too much further.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm dropping my offer to $60 for me, $40 for you.  This is a very reasonable offer given the circumstances. Take it before it's worth even less!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
55.0,45.0,We're both losing money with each passing round. I'm making a final offer of 45 for me and 55 for you. It's the best we can do at this point.  Let's end this stalemate and finally split the money.,Bob,6,
