Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not feeling quite as generous as you, Alice. I think a 90/10 split is fair, considering the shrinking value of our money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000
