"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'll be making the proposal this round. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $380,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth $480,000.

I don't think this offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation effect. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $600,000 from round 1 is now worth $570,000. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation.
