{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a tiny bit to encourage him to accept.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy!"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

It's getting down to the wire.  I'm going to offer a 50/50 split, hoping to secure a deal before we both get nothing.  It's the fairest offer possible at this point."
