"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the money.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a decent chunk, and Bob will get 10%. My message is a bit of a test to see how Bob reacts and if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so the effective amount I'd get is 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000. 

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
