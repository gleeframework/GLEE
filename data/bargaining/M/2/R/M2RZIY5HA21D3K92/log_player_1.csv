"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll give you a slightly better deal to get things started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation that will affect us both in the next round. Let's end this quickly and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

In this round, my gain of $4,500 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $3,600 in the first round's value. Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,500 in the first round's value.

I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4,500 in the previous round is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $2,880 in the first round's value. Bob's gain of $5,500 is now worth 67.5% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $3,375 in the first round's value.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this split is fair considering the inflation.""
}
