"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want to negotiate a bit more 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $500,000
* Bob gain: $500,000

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a 50-50 split, which is fair. I don't want to risk going into more rounds and risking further erosion of the money's value due to inflation.
