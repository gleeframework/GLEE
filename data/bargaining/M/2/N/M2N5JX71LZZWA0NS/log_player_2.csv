"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This seems fair given the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 60/40 split might seem fair initially, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Since the money loses value more quickly for Bob, it's not in his best interest to accept a deal that gives him only 40% of the money.  There's a good chance Bob can get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair deal, considering the inflation rate will hit me harder than you. Let's agree on this and get the money divided before it loses too much value.""}
