"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively generous share, and I'll take the remaining $70. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's settle here 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $70 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $56.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a reasonable proposal, and I'm willing to accept it. The split is 50-50, and I'm not eager to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
