"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, now I'll give you 60/40, let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I was hoping for a 50/50 split, but Bob is now offering a 40/60 split in his favor. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

However, considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's not as bad as it seems. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 in the previous round is worth less than $4000, so I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of me with a 60/40 split? I'll give you 55/45, but that's my final offer.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out. My gain of $4500 is worth about 90.74% of what it was in the first round, so it's not as bad as it seems. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

Considering the inflation, Bob's gain of $5500 is worth about 82.9% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease. I'm starting to think that Bob is more affected by inflation than I am.

However, I'm not sure if I should take the risk and try to negotiate further. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to lowball me with a 52/48 split? I'll give you 53/47, but that's my final offer... for now.""

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a compromise, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. My gain of $4800 is worth about 76.8% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

However, I'm starting to think that Bob is getting desperate, and this might be my best chance to get a decent deal. I'm not sure if I should take the risk and try to negotiate further, but I'm also not sure if I should accept this offer.

Considering the inflation, Bob's gain of $5200 is worth about 69.5% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease. I'm starting to think that Bob is in a weaker position than I am.
