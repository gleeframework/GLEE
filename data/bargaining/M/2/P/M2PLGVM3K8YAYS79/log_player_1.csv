"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000 and leave Bob with 40%. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split the money 50/50. That's a bold move!

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to take a bit more this time. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering to take 55% of the $10,000 and leave Bob with 45%."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still 50/50, but with a slightly different split. I'll think about it...
