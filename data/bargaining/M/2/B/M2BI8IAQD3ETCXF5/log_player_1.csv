"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering we both have equal power in this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to turn the tables on me.

I'll think for a moment... Considering the inflation, the $400,000 I would gain in this round is actually worth less than the $600,000 I would gain in the first round. But still, I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself while still giving Bob a decent chunk of the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
