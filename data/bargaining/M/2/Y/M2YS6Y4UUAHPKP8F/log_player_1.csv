Let's see if Bob thinks this is a fair deal!  I want to get as much of the money as possible, but I also want to make sure we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, I still believe I can get a larger share of the money.  The inflation is a factor, but I think I can still make a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower amount than before. The inflation has started to hit, but I still think this is a fair offer.  We both get a good amount of money, and it's a much better deal than the 50/50 split that Bob proposed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Although the inflation is starting to become more of a concern, I still believe I can get a larger share. The 520,000 is not a bad amount, but I'm not ready to settle for less than 600,000 yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, even though the inflation is getting worse.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this deal. We both get a decent amount of money, and it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is becoming a serious problem now, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. This is the best offer I've received, and even though it's a 50/50 split, it's better than losing everything."
