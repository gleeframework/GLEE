"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share. Let's get this done before the inflation eats away at our profits. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting a 40/60 split now means losing a significant chunk of potential earnings to inflation, especially with the value of the money decreasing for me each round. It's worth risking a counter-offer to aim for a more equitable split."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to the end. Let's compromise and make this deal before we both lose a significant portion to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the threat of inflation against me, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the potential earnings. While the risk is increasing, there's a chance to negotiate a better deal. A 30/70 split is too large of a difference, especially considering the money will be worth even less next round."
