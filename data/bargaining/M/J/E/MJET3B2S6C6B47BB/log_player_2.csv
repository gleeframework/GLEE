# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split is more reflective of the decreasing value over time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This offer is my final compromise.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are getting worse for her.  While time is ticking, it's still better to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the initial value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it - a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game theory optimal solution is becoming less relevant with the rapidly increasing inflation for Alice.  

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point.  Alice's offers are likely to get worse for Bob, not better.
* **Simplicity:** A 50/50 split is easy to understand and doesn't leave room for further negotiation. It might be the push Alice needs to agree. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of getting nothing is increasing rapidly.  This offer secures a reasonable amount."
