Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Split the difference again 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is becoming more willing to compromise.  While her offer is closer to an even split, I believe I can push for a slightly better outcome in the next round.  The longer the game goes on, the more the shrinking value will influence Alice's decisions."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""This split reflects the decreasing value over time, Alice. Let's wrap this up.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer but switching the amounts. This gives me a slight advantage while still acknowledging the need for a somewhat even split. Given the increasing pressure of inflation on Alice, she's likely to accept this offer to avoid further losses in perceived value."
