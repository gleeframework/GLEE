"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be fair, but I'll take 60% this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less in each round, I'd like to try to get a better deal or make a counteroffer. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the inflation that has affected the value of the money for both of us. Given that the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the initial round, I will adjust my offer accordingly.\n\nLet's calculate the effective value of the money for each of us after two rounds of inflation:\n- For me (Alice), the money is worth 90% of its original value after the first round and 90% of that after the second round, so 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 or 81% of its original value.\n- For Bob, the money is worth 95% of its original value after the first round and 95% of that after the second round, so 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 or approximately 90.25% of its original value.\n\nConsidering these adjustments and aiming for a more equitable split given the circumstances, I will make an offer that reflects the decreased value of the money for both parties but still aims for a compromise.\n\nMy offer will be to take 55% of the money for myself and give Bob 45%. This split acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us and represents a compromise from my initial 60% proposal, considering the rounds that have passed and the value adjustments.\n\nHere's my offer in the JSON format:\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust our shares fairly.""}"
