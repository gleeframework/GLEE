"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal. I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage, but not too high, to give Bob an incentive to accept.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain. Considering that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not sure if I should push for more or accept this offer, considering the significant drop in value of Bob's gain.
