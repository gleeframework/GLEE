"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more fairly this time, Alice.  We both lose out if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his potential gain in the next round, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  The inflation will hurt him more than me if we go another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  The inflation is eating away at your potential gains faster than mine. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation working against me. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a good point to accept. Here's why:

* **Bob's position has weakened:** Inflation has hit Bob much harder. His potential gains are diminishing rapidly.
* **Our positions are closer:** Bob is finally getting close to a reasonable split, acknowledging the impact of inflation.
* **Risk of further rejection:** If we reject, there's no guarantee Bob will offer something better in the next round. He might panic as inflation eats further into his potential gains.

While 60/40 isn't ideal, it's better than risking a worse outcome by holding out for a slightly larger share."
