"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself as the first proposer. This is a strong opening move, but I'm willing to negotiate in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8800 
# Bob gain: 1200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant gain, and the inflation risk makes rejecting it too risky."
