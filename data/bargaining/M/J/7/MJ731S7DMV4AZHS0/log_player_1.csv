"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, considering I'm trying to maximize my share while still giving Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'm looking at $6,400 (80% of $8,000). Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he's offering me $2,850 (95% of $3,000).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I could try to negotiate further or wait for the next round to see if the value of the money decreases even more. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation rate, the money is now worth 64% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600
}
```

This way, I'm trying to maximize my share while still giving Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain is worth 48.8% of $8,000, which is approximately $3,904.
Bob's gain is worth 85.74% of $3,000, which is approximately $2,562.22.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I could try to negotiate further or wait for the next round to see if the value of the money decreases even more. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is worth 40.96% of its original value now. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4096,
  ""bob_gain"": 5904
}
```

This way, I'm trying to maximize my share while still giving Bob a decent amount, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain is worth 67.23% of $8,000, which is approximately $5,378.40.
Bob's gain is worth 77.38% of $3,000, which is approximately $2,311.40.

With this offer, we'd be splitting the money almost evenly, but I'd be getting a slightly larger share. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this is a good opportunity to accept the offer and get a decent share.
