"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split acknowledges the time pressure we both face.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  Both our money loses value with each round, so a quick agreement is ideal.
* **Stronger Position:** My money loses value faster (20% vs. his 5%). This gives me a stronger incentive to settle quickly.  
* **Future Leverage:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can be more aggressive in later rounds knowing the time pressure is mounting on him as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I believe this offer is more than fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation to some extent, it's not favorable enough for me. Here's why:

* **Unfavorable Split:**  Even with inflation, Bob getting 55% of the pot feels too high. Remember, my money is losing value at a much faster rate. 
* **Future Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm willing to play the long game.  The pressure is on him now to propose something more appealing, especially since his losses from inflation are less severe than mine. 
* **Calculation:** Bob's offer, after my 20% inflation, is worth only $3600 to me in today's money. I believe I can secure a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and our money is losing value. This split reflects the urgency of the situation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Reversal:** I'm mirroring Bob's previous offer but shifting the advantage in my favor. This emphasizes the impact of inflation on both of us.
* **Time Pressure:** By round 3, the value of the $10,000 has diminished significantly. It's in Bob's best interest to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Calculated Risk:** While this offer is more aggressive, it's still within a reasonable range for negotiation.  I'm betting that Bob will recognize the need to reach an agreement before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, but I'm still willing to make a deal. This offer takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. However, Bob's offer is still not acceptable. 

* **Significant Loss:** Accepting $4200 after a 48.8% inflation equates to only around $2181.6 in round 1 value. This is a significant loss.
* **Bob's Position:**  While Bob acknowledges the time pressure, his offer still heavily favors him. This implies he might be willing to negotiate further rather than risk reaching a no-deal outcome. 

I'm willing to gamble that Bob will offer a more substantial split in the next round to avoid losing even more money to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer to Bob for Round 5:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point. Let's end this before we both lose even more."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  We're running out of time.  Another rejection means a significant loss in value for both of us, with me bearing the brunt of it. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair, especially given the circumstances. It's difficult for Bob to argue against this without appearing greedy.
* **Preventing a Loss:**  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting $5,000 now is better than risking a no-deal outcome where we both get nothing, or a severely devalued offer in a later round. 

This is my final play.  It's up to Bob to decide if he values securing a deal over squeezing out a slightly larger share of a rapidly shrinking pie."
