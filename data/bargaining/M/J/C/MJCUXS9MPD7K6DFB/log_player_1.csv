"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, which means I'll get $700,000 and Bob will get $300,000. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 80:20 is a more fair split, considering the inflation. Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist with the inflation! Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

I'm not too thrilled about the 80:20 split, but I'll consider it. However, I'd like to point out that I'll be getting $200,000, which is only 20% of the original $1,000,000, but it's still a decent amount.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
