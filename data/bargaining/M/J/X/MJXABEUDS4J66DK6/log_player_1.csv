  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2

# Bob's message: You were too generous in the first round, let's try for more for me this time. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to get a larger share.

```

```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you a huge advantage, but I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share. This is my final offer.""
