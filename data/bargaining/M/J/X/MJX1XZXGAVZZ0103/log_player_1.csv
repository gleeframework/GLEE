Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll aim to adjust my offer to account for the inflation. Since the money is worth 95% of its original value after two rounds, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which should give me a slightly larger share to make up for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $480,000 is worth 92.8% of the original $500,000, which is approximately $464,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
