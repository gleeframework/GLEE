Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's settle this. I'm taking a small step towards your last offer.  It's important we reach a deal soon. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
It pains me to accept this, but the rate of inflation is too high. Accepting a less favorable deal now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
