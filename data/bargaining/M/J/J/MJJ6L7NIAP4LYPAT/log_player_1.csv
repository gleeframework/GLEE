"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 270,000, and Bob's gain of 700,000 is now worth 630,000.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than that!

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less in the second round, and another 10% less in the third round), my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This is a 58-42 split in Bob's favor, but I think it's a reasonable offer considering the decreasing value of the money."
