I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than Bob's previous one, it's still not a fair deal. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. It's important to keep in mind that with each passing round, the money is worth less, so I need to secure a decent share before the value diminishes further."
