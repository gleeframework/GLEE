This is getting tight, but I still have some leverage. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. I need to push back harder in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' was quite laughable. You're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Alice is squeezing me hard.  Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 5 rounds left. Inflation is eating into my potential gains rapidly.
* **Alice's Strategy:**  She's betting I'll panic and accept a bad deal due to the time pressure. 
* **My Position:**  Rejecting this means I need to be prepared to accept even less later, or risk getting nothing.

Given the circumstances, and that Alice seems unwilling to accept anything close to even, I have to cut my losses.
