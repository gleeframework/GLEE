I propose a 95/5 split in my favor.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'll take the larger share, but I'm being generous with a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still not going to accept a deal where I get only $1. I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 90/10, still in my favor.  This is a better split for Bob than the last round, and I'm hoping it will be enough for him to accept.  I'm also taking into account the inflation, so I'm not losing as much money."
