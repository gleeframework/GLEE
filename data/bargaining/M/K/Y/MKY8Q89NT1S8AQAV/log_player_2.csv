Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still need a larger share considering the inflation disparity. This offer is fair and ensures we both walk away with a decent sum. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
