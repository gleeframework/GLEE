Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a fair split. However, time is money, and each round costs you more than me. Let's settle this quickly with a slightly better offer for me.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still convinced a 50/50 split is the fairest solution. Let's not waste more time and agree to this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, Bob is losing value in this deal due to inflation, and I'm not. I should be able to leverage this to get a larger share.  Bob is likely to become more amenable to a deal favoring me as the rounds progress and the penalty of inflation increases for him."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, time is ticking away, and frankly, your offers aren't getting more appealing. I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to be a bit more worthwhile for me. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Increased pressure:** Bob is now facing a 27.1% reduction in value. The urgency to settle is mounting.
* **Firm but fair:**  Offering a slightly larger share to myself while still presenting it as a compromise may entice Bob to accept rather than risk losing more with each passing round.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I aim to create a sense of urgency and encourage a decision this round. This tactic can be risky, but given the game dynamics, it might be the push needed for Bob to accept a less favorable deal before the value diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end. I'm willing to budge a bit to reach an agreement. Let's split it 49/51, and avoid both of us getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is finally acknowledging the need to compromise due to the increasing impact of inflation. While this offer isn't the 54/46 split I proposed, accepting 51/49 is a strategic move:

* **Guaranteed Gain:**  It secures me a win with a larger share than an even split, and more importantly, avoids the risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the game further carries the risk of Bob becoming desperate and offering even less favorable terms. Accepting now capitalizes on his current willingness to compromise.

This acceptance represents a balance between maximizing potential gain and securing a favorable outcome in a time-sensitive, high-risk scenario."
