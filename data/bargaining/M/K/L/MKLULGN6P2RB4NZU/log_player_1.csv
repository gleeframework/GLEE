"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can propose something better if you want!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was a fair split, so I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Bob's 50/50 split would give me $5,000, which is 83.33% of the original $6,000 I proposed in Round 1. That's a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own gain. You're getting a smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! With the new values, my gain of $4,000 is worth 40% of the original $6,000 I proposed in Round 1, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 60% of the original $4,000 he proposed in Round 1.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less for me, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next proposal to get a better deal.

However, I'll accept this offer for now, as it's still a better deal than going to Round 5.
