Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  It's a generous offer in the first round, but I want to start strong and see if I can secure a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a significant improvement from the first round, I'm confident I can still get a better deal.  I'm willing to wait and see if he'll make a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm raising my offer slightly, but still leaving a significant portion for Bob. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my interests.  It's also worth noting that Bob's potential gains are reduced by 30% due to inflation, making this offer potentially more appealing to him."
