"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be rational, Bob. Considering the inflation rates, this split ensures we both get a fair share after a few rounds. If we delay, we both lose value, but you lose more. Accept this offer and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand your logic, Alice. But considering the inflation affects me more, I think a 60/40 split is more fair. This ensures both of us maximize our gains despite the inflation. Let's get this done quickly and avoid further losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right about the impact of inflation, but your offer doesn't quite balance the scale for me. Given that each round costs me less than it costs you, I'm willing to be a bit more generous than before, but I still need to prioritize my gains. This offer is closer to reflecting the actual value we both stand to lose with each passing round. Let's not drag this out further. 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
