"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself, considering the impact of inflation on both of our gains. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's relatively fair given the conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts us in a tough spot. Let's make this quick and fair. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the decreasing value of money due to inflation, accepting $4,500 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I'd accepted a higher offer in the first round, considering the 20% decrease in value for me. It's strategic to try and get a better offer in the next round or make a counteroffer that benefits me more, taking into account the different rates at which our money loses value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, let's adjust and find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the effects of inflation and our previous offers, I'll propose taking $5,800 and offering Bob $4,200. This adjustment aims to find a middle ground, acknowledging the loss of value over the rounds but still seeking a fair division that might be acceptable to Bob, given the different rates of value loss we're experiencing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's important we settle this now before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for me, and considering that Bob's offer is his final one, it seems prudent to accept this division. The difference in the loss of value between us makes each subsequent round more disadvantageous for me. Accepting $4,900 now, despite the decreased value, might be the best option to secure some gain before the value drops further. Continuing could risk ending up with even less value in real terms."
