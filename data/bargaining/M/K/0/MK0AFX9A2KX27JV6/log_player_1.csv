"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This way, I'll get 90% of the money, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less and less with each round. I'll think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was quite generous, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, we'll both get a roughly equal share of the money, but I'll get a slight edge."
