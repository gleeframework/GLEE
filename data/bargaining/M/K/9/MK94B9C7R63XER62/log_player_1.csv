"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer!  I know Bob might not accept it, but I want to see if he's willing to take even a tiny bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's likely that Bob will become more greedy in the next round.  It's better to take 600,000 now than risk getting less later."
