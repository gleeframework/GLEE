"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, with a slight advantage for me to start. This ensures we both benefit from ending the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept an almost-even split, I'm going to take advantage of the inflation dynamic.  I know Alice is losing value on her money at a higher rate than I am, so I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Since the money is worth less to you with each round, I'm offering you a slightly smaller share, but with the benefit of ending the game now and avoiding further inflation. This should be a win-win for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear that dragging this out only hurts me.  I'm proposing a simple and fair 50/50 split.  Let's end this now and both walk away with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, Alice's offer is a fair and reasonable compromise. Accepting this 50/50 split ensures we both get a decent amount and avoid any further risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains."
