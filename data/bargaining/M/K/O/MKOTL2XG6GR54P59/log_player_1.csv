"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Since the money is worth less to you with each round, I'm offering you a slightly smaller share, but with the benefit of ending the game now and avoiding further inflation. This should be a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
