"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted to take it rather than risk losing even more in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer more, this offer is still significantly better than what I would get after another round of inflation.  I'm taking it!"
