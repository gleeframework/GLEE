"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share, is more fair. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially since I'm the one who proposed a 60/40 split in the first round and got rejected.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45."
