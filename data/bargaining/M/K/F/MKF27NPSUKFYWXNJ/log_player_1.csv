"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's the most rational choice in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial offer, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking further inflation."
