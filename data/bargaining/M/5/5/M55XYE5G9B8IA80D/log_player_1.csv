"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal next round, but this is my opening offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'm now looking at a gain of $4000, which is a good chunk, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal from Bob in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not going to get any more generous than this""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. The inflation is making it harder to get a good share, but I'm not ready to give in yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to find a fair split again, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm going back to a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this time and we can end the game."
