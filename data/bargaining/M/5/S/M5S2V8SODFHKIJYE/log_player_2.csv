"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money loses value for Alice but not for me. I'll make an offer that's slightly in my favor, but still reasonable enough for Alice to consider.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60/40 is a fair compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation, but I think 45/55 is a better compromise, considering we're both losing out a bit. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, and Alice has offered a compromise that is closer to my previous offer, I can try to negotiate for an even better deal in the next round or accept this offer considering it's relatively fair and the inflation impact on Alice's gain is increasing.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nHowever, considering the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's gain and the risk of Alice making a worse offer in the next round, accepting this offer might be the best choice. But, for now, I'll choose to reject to see if I can get an even better deal.\n\n###\n\nCorrected response to follow the exact format required:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's gain, while still being favorable to me. Since Alice's gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, I can try to offer a slightly smaller share to Alice.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact on your gain, I think 62/38 is a reasonable adjustment.""}"
