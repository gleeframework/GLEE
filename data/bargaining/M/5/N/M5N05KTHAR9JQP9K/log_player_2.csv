This is a good starting point.  Bob should reject this offer.  While it's a lot of money, he has a chance to get more, and the inflation will impact his gains over time if he accepts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the inflation has impacted Bob's gains, Alice's offer is now closer to a 50/50 split. It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer, as there's no guarantee that the offers will improve in the future rounds, and the potential for further inflation could make the deal even less favorable for Bob."
