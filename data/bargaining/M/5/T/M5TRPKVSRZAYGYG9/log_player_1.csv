"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm still open to negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the inflation, the $200,000 I'll get is actually worth $180,000 compared to the original $1,000,000. Not bad, but I'd rather get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Your turn to respond!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share considering the current value of the money 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! Considering the current value of the money, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll receive:

* Original $250,000 is now worth $182,500 (due to 27.1% inflation from the first round)
* Original $750,000 is still worth $750,000 (no inflation for Bob's share)

I'm not thrilled about the 25-75 split, but I'll accept this offer to get some money. It's better than going to the next round with even less value.
