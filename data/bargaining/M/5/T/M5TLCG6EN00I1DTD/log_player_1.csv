"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 40% share yet. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation."
