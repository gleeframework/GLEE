I'll reject this offer.  While it's a starting point, 100,000 is far too low, especially considering the risk of inflation.  I need a much larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation. Let's see if Alice accepts."
