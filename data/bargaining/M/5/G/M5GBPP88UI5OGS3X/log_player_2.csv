This is a tough spot. Bob is getting squeezed by inflation.  Here's why I'm making the decision to accept:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the deal for Bob is getting significantly worse with each round. By rejecting, he risks getting even less in a future round.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and is using it to her advantage.  She's likely to keep pushing for a larger share.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While $3,500 is much less than Bob wanted, it's still better than continuing to lose money to inflation and potentially getting nothing. 

It's a gamble either way, but at this point, cutting losses might be the best option."
