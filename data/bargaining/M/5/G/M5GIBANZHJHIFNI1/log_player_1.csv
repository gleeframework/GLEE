"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to see if he accepts and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain now is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 60% of the remaining amount. I want to wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share. Consider this offer, Bob.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain slightly, but still keeping the offer relatively balanced to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
