Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given our respective inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob's offer is too generous to him, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more considering the original 80% I proposed""}

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, but still favoring me slightly due to the original 80% I suggested."
