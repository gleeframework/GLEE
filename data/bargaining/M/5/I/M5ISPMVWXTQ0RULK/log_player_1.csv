Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is fair, considering the inflation affecting your share. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 65-35 split, considering I'm already getting hit with 5% less value due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.
