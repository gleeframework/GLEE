"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept something small in the first round, hoping for a better deal later.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 9500 
# Bob gain: 500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's a significant improvement over his previous offer, I still believe I can do better. The inflation factor is starting to impact me, but I think I can still get a good deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 8000,  but I'm still keeping the majority of the money.  I think Bob is getting more and more desperate with each round.  He might accept this offer to avoid getting nothing in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 9200 
# Bob gain: 800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Inflation is hitting hard, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit. This offer is still significantly better than what I would get if I keep rejecting offers and end up with nothing. I'll take the 9200 and try to make the most of it."
