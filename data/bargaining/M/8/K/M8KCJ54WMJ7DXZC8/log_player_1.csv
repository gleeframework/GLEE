  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share now, but I'll give you a decent amount to make it worth your while. This way, we can end the game quickly and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
