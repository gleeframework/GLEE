"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This way, I'll get a decent amount, and Bob will still get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth significantly less now, I'll consider accepting this offer to avoid further losses.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
