"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  My turn to propose.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a good deal for both of us before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
Explanation:

* It's Round 3, and the money is losing value quickly. 
* While not ideal, Alice's offer is better than her Round 1 offer. 
* If I reject and propose in Round 4, the money will be worth even less, and Alice might be less likely to accept a deal favorable to me.  
``` 
It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a worse deal later due to inflation."
