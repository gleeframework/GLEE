Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your frustration, but we're both in a tough spot now.  I'm proposing a final offer of 75/25 in my favor. This reflects the harsh reality of inflation and the dwindling time we have. We need to reach a compromise or we'll both lose everything.

# Bob gain: 7500

This is a tough spot.  While the offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor, rejecting it means risking getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds. The inflation is working heavily against both of us, and Bob seems entrenched in his position.  It's better to secure something now than risk losing everything."
