"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  I think that's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering the new proposal, I'll decide to reject it. The split is indeed even, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to take 60% of the remaining $10,000, leaving $4,000 for Bob."
