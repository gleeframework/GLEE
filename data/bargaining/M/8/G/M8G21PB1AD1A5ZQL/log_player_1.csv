"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

This offer splits the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000. I'm suggesting this as a starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A good start, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bigger share.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too uneven, I want a better deal""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but still a good compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a smaller share than before, but still a decent compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a bigger share for himself.

I'll reject this offer and make another counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too uneven, I want a fairer split""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, so I'll try to come up with a new offer that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a slightly smaller share for me, but still a more balanced split than his previous offer."
