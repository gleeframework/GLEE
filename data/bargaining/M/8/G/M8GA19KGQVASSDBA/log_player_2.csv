Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting us both hard. Let's meet closer to the middle to cut our losses. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer still slightly favors Alice, the impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant. Accepting this offer secures me close to half the initial amount, which is a better outcome than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing in the end."
