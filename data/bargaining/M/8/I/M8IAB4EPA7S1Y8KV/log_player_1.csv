"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a reasonable 40% of the total amount. I'll take $600,000, which is 60% of the total amount. I believe this is a fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Although the money is worth 20% less to me now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer is the same as my initial offer, but with the inflation, I'd be getting less value out of it. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit more than what I offered initially, and I'll take $550,000. This way, we're both getting a decent share, and I'm taking into account the decrease in value for me. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
