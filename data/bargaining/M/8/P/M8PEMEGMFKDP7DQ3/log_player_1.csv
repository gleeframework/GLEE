Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  But since the money is losing value more for you, let's switch the split for this round.  60/40 works for me, but with you taking the bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
