"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's true that I'm getting a small portion, it's still a significant amount less than what I was initially hoping for.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

With the new offer, my gain is now worth 48.8% of what it was in the first round. I'm getting even less than before.
