I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will see it's in his best interest to take it and avoid risking getting nothing at all in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I reject this offer. I want more than $1000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a significant share. Hopefully, this offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept, as we're getting closer to the end of the game."
