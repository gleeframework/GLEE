"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the offer is a 40-60 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split than my previous offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
