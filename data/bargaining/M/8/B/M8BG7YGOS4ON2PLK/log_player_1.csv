"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable proposal. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is a fair compromise, and meeting in the middle seems reasonable.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
