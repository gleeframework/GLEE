Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a bit more, but this split accounts for the decreasing value""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more, it's still a good deal for you 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I'll give you a bit less, but still a reasonable share 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though inflation is hitting Bob harder, Alice's offer is getting greedier.  Bob needs to hold firm to try and get a better deal. Time is running out, but accepting a bad deal will leave Bob with significantly less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming critical.  While Bob has rejected Alice's increasingly unfair offers, she doesn't seem to be getting the message.  A 50/50 split, even with the impact of inflation, is better than risking getting nothing if the rounds run out."
