Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time.  I think this is fair given the money is losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
