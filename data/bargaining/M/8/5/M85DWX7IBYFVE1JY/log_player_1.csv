"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm curious to see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my offer, so I'll try to get a better deal now. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

I'll reject Bob's offer again. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you can get the better deal just because I rejected your first offer? Not so fast, Bob!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting desperate, Bob. Let's try to find a fair deal before things get worse.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'm not going to settle for that. I think I can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze more out of me!

Considering the significant inflation, I'll have to be careful with my next move. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you can get a 55-45 split now? I'm not going to give up that easily, Bob. Bring your best offer!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

With the money worth 19.32% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, Bob. Let's split it 50-50 and be done with it.""
}
```"
