"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's counteroffer. I think I can do better than a 40-60 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up 60% of the money, Bob!""
}
```

It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, my offer is now based on 80% of the original amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
