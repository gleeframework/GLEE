"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split.  It's a fair starting point, and I think we can both be happy with it. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 60/40 split isn't bad, but I think I can get a better deal. Plus, the inflation rate is higher for Alice, so I'm hoping she'll be more willing to compromise as the rounds go on. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more in my favor, considering the inflation rates. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  With inflation continuing, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option to ensure we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer carefully. Considering the inflation rates, a 50/50 split might not be so bad. Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, and the money Alice gains is worth 36% less, this split is actually more favorable to me than it seems at first glance. I'll accept this offer to ensure I get a decent share before the money loses even more value.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the deal!"
