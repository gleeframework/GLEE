"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm hoping to get more later 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 36$ (since 90% of 40 is 36). Bob's gain of 60$ is worth 57$ (since 95% of 60 is 57).

Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to get a better deal in the next round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one. Let's reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40$ is now worth 36$ (since 90% of 36 is 32.4). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I'm not getting left with nothing!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32/68 split, trying to leave a bit more room for Bob to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small piece, but I'm trying to get a bigger share now 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 25$ is worth 18.25$ (since 72.9% of 25 is 18.225, but I'll round to 18.25 for simplicity).
Bob's gain of 75$ is worth 64.39$ (since 85.74% of 75 is 64.395, but I'll round to 64.39 for simplicity).

Considering the inflation and Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to get a better deal now. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one. However, I'm getting a bit concerned about the value of my gain decreasing rapidly.

Let's reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 25$ is now worth 18.25$ (since 72.9% of 18.25 is 13.33, but I'll round to 13.33 for simplicity). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 13,
  ""bob_gain"": 87,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still trying to get something!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 13/87 split, leaving Bob with most of the remaining value. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
