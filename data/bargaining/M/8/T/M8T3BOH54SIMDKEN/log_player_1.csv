"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, let's end the game here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 75% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 25%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining amount. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much.""
}
```

This offer gives me 42% of the remaining amount, and Bob gets 58%. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous enough, I want more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my share is now a significant portion of the remaining amount. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, given the effects of inflation, I think 30% of the remaining amount is a decent share, and I don't want to risk going to another round where the money will be worth even less."
