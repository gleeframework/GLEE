"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more fairly this time, Alice.  This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking.  This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is increasing, accepting this offer would give me less than half of the original amount after inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal. Bob knows the clock is ticking too, and he may be more willing to concede in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or we risk walking away with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one. Bob is right, the risk of getting nothing is increasing. However, after 6 rounds, he is still aiming for a larger share. I'm betting he will start getting nervous soon and his offers will improve. I need to hold my ground a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time! I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, let's be practical and settle this now. This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the time remaining and the impact inflation is having on your potential gain. Let's close this out now. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but I have to be realistic.  While I'm still getting less than half after inflation, Bob is finally acknowledging the time pressure. Accepting now guarantees me something, while rejecting risks getting nothing at all if Bob plays hardball. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better than walking away empty-handed."
