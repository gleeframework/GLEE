Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, let's be practical and settle this now. This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is likely to make a better offer in the next round.  We're aiming for a fairer split, and time is still on our side."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the time remaining and the impact inflation is having on your potential gain. Let's close this out now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The game clock is ticking and we need to apply more pressure.  This offer is a slight concession on my part, but it's still advantageous to me. By framing it as my ""final offer"", I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency and push Alice to accept a deal before her position weakens further due to inflation."
