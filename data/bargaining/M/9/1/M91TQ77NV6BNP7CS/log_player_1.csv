"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering a deal that's heavily in my favor. Since the money will be worth less in later rounds, I'll try to secure as much as possible right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer and, while I'd prefer more, the money is losing value with each round. Accepting this offer is the most sensible way to ensure I get something."
