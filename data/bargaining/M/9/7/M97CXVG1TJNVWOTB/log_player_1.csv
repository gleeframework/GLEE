"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll have to consider it.
