"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering I'll be getting less each round due to the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that 55-45 is the most fair split, especially since I'll be losing more value with each passing round due to the 10% inflation. I'd like to negotiate further and aim for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, considering the inflation and the rounds left""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation and the limited number of rounds left."
