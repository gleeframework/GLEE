Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my turn now.  I propose 70/30.  Consider that your share decreases each round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
