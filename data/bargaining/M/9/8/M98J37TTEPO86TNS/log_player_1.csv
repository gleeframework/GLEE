"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\nI offered Bob $40, which is close to half of the money, but not quite. Since Bob's money loses value over time, he might be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risking a worse deal in the next round.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more equitable arrangement is in order. This offer reflects the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because, although the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, accepting $40 is less than what I initially offered to Bob. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me, I can afford to wait for a potentially better offer or try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob do next?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway on the last offer""}\n\n###\nGiven that Bob's money is losing value over time and he is under pressure to make a deal, I've decided to make a slightly more generous offer than my initial one but less generous than Bob's offer in the previous round. This approach aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money for him.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because, despite his claim that it's his final offer, the amount he's offering me ($45) is still less than what I previously offered to him ($55 in Round 3). Given that the value of money remains constant for me but decreases for Bob, I have the upper hand in negotiations. I'm betting that Bob's urgency to close the deal due to the devaluing of his potential gains will push him to either accept a less favorable offer in the next round or make a better proposal.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob do next?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Last chance before I take the majority""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my proposed gain slightly, while still offering Bob a considerable amount, given the significant decrease in value he's facing due to inflation. The message is designed to pressure Bob into accepting, as the implication is that I will offer even less in the next round if this one is rejected. Given the urgency on Bob's part due to the devaluing of his potential gains, I'm hoping this offer will be seen as the best option he's likely to get.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
