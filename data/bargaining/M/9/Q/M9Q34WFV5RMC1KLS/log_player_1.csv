I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 90% and Bob taking 10%. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rate will affect Bob more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

I'm offering 810,000 for myself and 190,000 for Bob.  This is a more balanced offer, considering the inflation rate. I'm willing to give a little more to Bob in hopes of reaching an agreement."

```

I'm offering 729,000 for myself and 271,000 for Bob.  I am offering more to Bob than my previous offer.  The inflation rate is increasing, and I am willing to make a slightly more generous offer to avoid losing more money in the future."

```

I'm offering 656,100 for myself and 343,900 for Bob.  I am trying to find a balance between maximizing my own gain and keeping the offer appealing to Bob.  The inflation rate is continuing to climb, so I am offering more than I did in the previous round to make this a more appealing offer."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation rate, but I am not going to accept that offer.  I know that the longer the game goes on, the worse the inflation will get for both of us.  But if I accept this offer, I will lose a significant portion of my potential earnings.  I am willing to play it out a few more rounds and see if we can find a more equitable solution."

Round 9

```

I'm offering 590,490 for myself and 409,510 for Bob.  I understand the inflation rate is increasing rapidly and is significantly affecting Bob, but I am still trying to secure a good deal for myself.  I am offering more to Bob than I did in the last round, hoping to reach an agreement before inflation depletes our potential earnings even further."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.

``` 
I'm still not willing to accept this offer, even with the increasing inflation rate.  I understand that the game is getting very difficult for both of us, but I don't want to give away too much just to avoid getting nothing.  I believe we can still reach a compromise before the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 531441, ""bob_gain"": 468559}
```

We're getting dangerously close to the deadline, and the inflation is really hurting both of us. I'm offering a 53/47 split in my favor, recognizing the pressure of the timer.  This is a compromise, but it's the best I can offer while still getting a reasonable share."
