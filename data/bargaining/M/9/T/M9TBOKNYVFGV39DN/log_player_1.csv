"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a pretty standard, 60/40 split in favor of Alice. It's a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects it, but it's not too aggressive to risk him accepting it right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a risky move by Bob, as he is offering a significantly lower share to Alice, and while the inflation is making the money worth less, it's not enough to justify a 1500 dollar decrease in Alice's share.  Rejecting this offer sets up Alice to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer is a counter-proposal to Bob's offer in round 2.  It's a compromise, offering a bit less than Alice's original offer but more than what Bob proposed.  It acknowledges the inflation but still tries to secure a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly aggressive. While the inflation is substantial, his offer is still too low to accept. Even with the reduced value of the money,  Alice's share is significantly lower than her original offer.  It's better to continue the game and attempt to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This offer proposes an even split of the money.  Since the inflation has been quite substantial, and Bob has shown a willingness to push for a larger share, an even split might be the most reasonable solution. It gives Alice a decent amount while also recognizing the impact of inflation."
