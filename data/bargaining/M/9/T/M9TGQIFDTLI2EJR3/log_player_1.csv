"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%. I'm starting with a generous offer to see if Bob is willing to cooperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant drop from the first round, and while it still represents a sizable amount of money, I'm not willing to accept it so early in the game. I want to see if we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly from the first round, but still offering a substantial amount to Bob. Hopefully this will convince him to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer keeps getting worse, and the inflation is seriously affecting my potential gains.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount at this point. I need to keep trying to negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob.  The inflation is becoming a serious problem, and I need to find a way to get Bob to accept before it erodes too much of our potential winnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although inflation has significantly reduced my potential gains, Bob's offer is finally a 50/50 split.  It's not ideal, but it's better than the alternative of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing even more to inflation.  I'll accept the offer and secure half of the remaining money."
