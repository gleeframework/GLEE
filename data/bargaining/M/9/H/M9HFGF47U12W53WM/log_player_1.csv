Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to be careful not to give up too much. I'll reject the offer for now.

```

}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll aim to keep a larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation effect, I need to be cautious and think carefully about the offer. However, since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less and Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, I'll consider this a relatively better offer for me. I'll accept it.
