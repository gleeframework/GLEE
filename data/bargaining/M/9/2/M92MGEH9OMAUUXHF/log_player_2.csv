"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly but slightly in my favor considering the inflation disadvantage I have. This ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's important to keep in mind that the money is worth less for Bob with each passing round.  While Alice's offer seems fair now, it might be more advantageous to wait and see what she offers in the next round, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split this 50/50.  We both lose money each round, so a fair split seems like the best option to maximize our gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the need for a fair split, but the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. This offer is a compromise, slightly better for me than a straight 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is only slightly better for her than the 50/50 split. While the money is worth less to me due to inflation, accepting this offer secures a significant gain, and further delay could risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
