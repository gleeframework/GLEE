"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'm now looking at a gain of $4500, which is worth 5% less than the $5000 I proposed in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to give up $500 more than I proposed in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}

I'm trying to balance the gain between us, taking into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the adjusted gains, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that's still a bit unfavorable to me.

However, I think I'll accept this offer, as the difference between 4200 and 5800 is smaller than the difference between 4800 and 5200 in the previous round, and the money is worth less overall.
