"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a larger share, but leaves some for Bob to consider. I want to see if he's willing to accept a relatively fair deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, it's still extremely unfair. I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This offer again gives me the majority, but I'm increasing Bob's share slightly to see if he's more receptive. The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly unfair, and while the inflation is starting to impact my potential gains, I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping for a more equitable outcome in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm further increasing Bob's share, but I'm still aiming for a majority. The inflation is taking a toll, but I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this offer will convince him to accept before the inflation becomes even more severe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too skewed in his favor. While the inflation is starting to become a serious concern, I believe that I can still secure a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round to try and find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

The inflation is really starting to affect my potential gains, but I'm still not willing to accept a deal that gives Bob the majority. I'm hoping this offer, while still leaning in my favor, is enough to convince Bob to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is drastically impacting my gains, I'm not ready to accept an offer where I get less than half. I'm still hoping we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're down to the wire, and the inflation is hitting hard. I'm willing to split the money evenly with Bob, recognizing that further rejection risks both of us getting nothing.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in reaching a compromise before it's too late."
