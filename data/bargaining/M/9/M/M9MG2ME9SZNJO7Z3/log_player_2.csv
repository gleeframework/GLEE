Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take 70%, you get 30%. This is my final offer,  any more rounds and the value of your share will shrink even further.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my guns, Alice.  I'll take 80% and you can have the remaining 20%.  I'm sure you understand that the value of your share will continue to decrease with each passing round. Don't let your greed lead to nothing. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, taking Alice's offer is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of Bob's potential share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Waiting any longer will result in an even smaller payout, even if he manages to negotiate a slightly better split.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has shown no willingness to budge significantly from her offer. It's unlikely she will agree to a drastically different split in further rounds.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting the 20% offer, while far from ideal, still gives Bob a significant sum of money. Rejecting it risks ending the game with nothing. 

While accepting feels like giving in to a ""greedy"" Alice, it's the most rational decision given the game's rules and the rapidly shrinking value of Bob's potential earnings.
