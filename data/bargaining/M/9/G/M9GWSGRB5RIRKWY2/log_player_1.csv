"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, giving Bob a small share. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how Bob values the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it appears to be a 50/50 split, the inflation makes it less beneficial for me than it appears. I'm hoping to secure a larger share, and I'm confident I can do so in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my share again. The inflation is starting to become a factor, so I need to secure a larger portion of the money.  By offering Bob 3000, I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation is impacting the value of the money, I'm not willing to accept a smaller share than what I was offered in the previous round. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm taking a more moderate approach this round. The inflation is becoming more significant, but I'm not ready to settle for a smaller share just yet. By offering Bob 4000, I'm hoping to find a compromise that allows us both to secure a decent amount of money before the inflation further reduces the value of our earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  This offer is essentially a 50/50 split, which I'm not willing to accept. I think I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

The inflation is becoming a major factor, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm lowering my proposed share to 5500, hoping to find a compromise with Bob. While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I need to be realistic about the diminishing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is taking a serious toll, and I'm getting nervous about running out of rounds.  I realize that Bob is likely feeling the effects of inflation too.  While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise at this point, and I'm concerned that rejecting this offer might lead to a worse outcome in the remaining rounds."
