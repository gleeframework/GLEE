This offer is not bad, but Bob should try to get a better deal. He's got 12 rounds and can use the inflation to his advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  We both get the most this way in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob should keep rejecting. He's still got time and can get a better deal. Inflation is working in his favor."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Inflation is in my favor, I'm taking a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should continue to reject.  He's losing money with each round, but he's still got more rounds to go and inflation will eventually work in his favor more. Alice is being greedy and Bob should stand his ground."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm taking the risk here, Alice.  Inflation is going to hurt me more in the coming rounds. This is my best offer, and I need to see some compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Inflation is crippling your share, I'm taking a bigger cut 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is very unfavorable, Bob still has time on his side.  He needs to stay strong and hold out for a better deal.  There are still several rounds left, and inflation will eventually make the remaining money worth less to Alice, forcing her to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both getting hurt by inflation now.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to see some movement from you.  Let's find a way to split the remaining money fairly before it's worth nothing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm taking a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is in a tough spot now, but he needs to keep rejecting. He has two more rounds, and Alice is getting greedy. Even though her offer is very unfavorable, Bob needs to hold out for a better deal. Inflation will eventually force her to compromise. He still has a chance to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. We're both losing money with each round. This is my final offer. If you reject, we both get nothing. Let's be reasonable and split what's left.""}

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Last chance, I'm taking the lion's share 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should reject this offer.  While it's extremely tempting to take *something*, he's in the last round.  If he rejects, Alice will have to offer him something. Even if Alice offers 1$ in the next round, that's more than 0$!  Inflation is punishing Bob severely, but if he rejects, he can force Alice to offer him a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Alice, we're down to the wire. This is my final offer.  If we don't agree, we both get nothing.  It's time to be reasonable, or we both lose.""}
