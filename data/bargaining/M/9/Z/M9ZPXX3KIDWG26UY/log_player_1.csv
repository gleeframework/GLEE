"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and we're not fighting over every last penny. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only 300,000, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
