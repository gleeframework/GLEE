9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust it later if you think it's too much.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite unbalanced. Let's be fair - I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  This accounts for the time value of money given the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 40%.  Let's split it 65/35 in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that we're both losing value due to inflation, and it's a fairer split than your last offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing with each round.  My last offer was more than fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway - 55/45 split in my favor seems like a reasonable compromise considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
