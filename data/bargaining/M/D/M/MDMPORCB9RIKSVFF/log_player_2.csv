"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer seems fair on the surface, but Alice is losing value much faster than I am due to inflation. I can likely get a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases rapidly for you. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a slightly bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, her offer is still tilted in her favor. The longer the game goes on, the more desperate she'll become to secure a deal. I believe I can push for a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer gives you a decent share considering the rapidly declining value. Time is running out for a good deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, but I'm still not convinced. Meeting in the middle is the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally feeling the heat and talking about a ""fair"" deal, but her offer is still not reflecting the reality of the situation. She's losing value at a much faster rate. While I need to be mindful of the shrinking pot, I can afford to hold out for a better offer a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting critical for you. My offer is more than generous considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
