"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $570,000. And Bob's offer is that I receive $300,000, which is 95% of $400,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my previous $600,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $570,000. And Bob's offer in the previous round was $300,000, which is 75% of $400,000.

Here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I think this is a fair compromise. Let's wrap it up. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my previous $600,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $514,440.

Bob's offer is that I receive $450,000, which is 45% of $1,000,000. I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'm not sure if I want to push my luck either. I'll accept Bob's offer, but only because I think it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take it. It's not my best deal, but I'm tired of negotiating.""
}"
