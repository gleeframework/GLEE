Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This offer gives me a 60/40 split, which is a good starting point. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept this relatively fair deal, or if he's going to be greedy and try to get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to flip the script and take a 60/40 split for himself! While the inflation hurts, I'm not going to accept a deal where I'm getting the short end of the stick. I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to slightly increase my share to 5500, hoping to find a middle ground. This is still a fair deal considering the inflation we've experienced. If Bob rejects this offer, he'll be risking even more money in the next round due to the inflation."
