"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
 I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with just a single dollar.  It's a classic negotiation tactic to start with a very high offer, knowing it's unlikely to be accepted. This sets the stage for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable offer, and there's no real incentive to continue the game. It's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the next round."
