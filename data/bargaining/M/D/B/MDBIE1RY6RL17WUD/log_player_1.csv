"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 70 is worth 5% less than my initial 60, which is 58.5. Bob's gain of 30 is worth 10% less than his initial 40, which is 36.

I'll think about it...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the decreasing value of money 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 75 is worth 14.26% less than my initial 60, which is 51.6.
Bob's gain of 25 is worth 27.1% less than his initial 40, which is 29.1.

I'll think about it...
