Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a large share for myself, knowing Bob's money depreciates faster.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less than my initial offer. I'm not satisfied with this, and I still have the advantage of having more rounds left to make a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still leaving a significant portion for myself. I'm confident Bob will see the value in accepting this offer, as he's losing money at a faster rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my initial share, it's still too low. I'm losing value with each round, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to get a better deal. I'm confident that I can secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, but still keeping the majority share for myself. The inflation is starting to hit hard, but I believe I can still secure a good deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than his previous offers, the inflation is hitting me hard. I still believe I can secure a better deal within the remaining rounds. I'm not willing to accept such a low share just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500} 
```

I'm making a final attempt to get a good deal. I'm lowering my share again, but I believe this is the best offer I can make considering the inflation. With only a few rounds left, Bob might accept this offer to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally reasonable.  The inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with only a few rounds left.  It's time to take the 50/50 split and move on."
