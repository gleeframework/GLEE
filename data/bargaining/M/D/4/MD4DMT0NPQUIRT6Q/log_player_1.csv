I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fairer share. This offer is a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing the inflation that has occurred. Let's end this game on a mutually beneficial note."
