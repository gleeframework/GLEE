I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate in the next round if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting less than I wanted, the inflation means I'm losing more if I keep rejecting offers. This offer is still better than what I'd have gotten in the next round."
