"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids any immediate risk of losing money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, Bob's offer is still advantageous for me. It's better to take a slightly lower share now than risk further inflation and potentially receive even less in subsequent rounds."
