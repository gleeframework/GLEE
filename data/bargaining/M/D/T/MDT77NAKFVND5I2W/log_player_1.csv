"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to be more cautious. Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $4,750
* Bob gain: $4,750

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal.
