Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a bigger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, I don't want to give up too much either.

  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve a bigger share now""
