# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our last offers. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate as the value of her potential winnings decreases. While she is moving closer to a more even split, time is on my side. I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, it's getting late in the game. I'm offering you a deal you should seriously consider before the value drops further.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly. While 60-40 is a reversal of Alice's initial offer, the devaluation makes it increasingly appealing to her as time runs out.  This puts the pressure on and might make her more agreeable."
