"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After calculating the value of the proposed amounts, I see that I'd get $63 (70 - 10% of 70) and Bob would get $27 (30 - 20% of 30).

I'm still not satisfied with the split, but I'll try to be more reasonable. I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in the next round.
