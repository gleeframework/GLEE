"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and then we can reassess in future rounds.""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and simple starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's take more now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'm not as motivated to accept a deal that gives me $4000. However, I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't divide the money soon.
