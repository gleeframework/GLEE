"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not satisfied with 40% of the money. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, the inflation rate is higher for Alice, so she has more to lose if we don't agree on a deal soon. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the inflation rate is higher for you. Let's compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Inflation is hurting us both, so let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation rates, Alice's offer is reasonable. The money I gain may be worth 19% less than initially, but it's still a significant amount. Since Alice is also losing value, her willingness to split it evenly shows she's looking for a mutually beneficial agreement. Accepting this offer seems like the best decision, given the circumstances."
