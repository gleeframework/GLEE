"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, my gain of $45 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $55 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
