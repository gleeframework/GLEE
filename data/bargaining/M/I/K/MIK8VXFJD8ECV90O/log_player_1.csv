"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of 45-55, Bob is trying to take a slightly larger share of the money. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

This time, I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, hoping he'll accept."

# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of 42-58, Bob is still trying to take a larger share, but not as aggressively as before. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but it's a slightly more generous offer than before.
