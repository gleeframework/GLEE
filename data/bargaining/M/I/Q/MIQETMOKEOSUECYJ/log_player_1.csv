"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This seems fair given the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split in your favor.  This is fair considering the declining value of the money for me.  Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
