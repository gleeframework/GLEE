"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise and end the game quickly, but I'm also getting a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly!  We can both walk away with a good amount if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 in this round is actually worth $4,500 in real terms.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again due to inflation, my offer is now:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, but keeping $6,000 for myself."
