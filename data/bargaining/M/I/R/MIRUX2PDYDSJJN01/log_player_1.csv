"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a slight advantage over waiting.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Advantage:** Offering Bob slightly less than half incentivizes him to accept. A 5% loss on $1,000,000 is significant, so getting something now is generally better than risking a worse outcome later.
* **Future Rounds:** If Bob rejects, I'm willing to accept a slightly less favorable deal in the next round, knowing he'll be under pressure to offer something acceptable before inflation eats further into the pot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your sense of fairness is a little off.  I'm offering you the same deal, but reversed. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is logical and the best I can likely achieve in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Mirroring:** Bob simply mirrored my initial offer, highlighting its fairness. 
* **Inflation:**  Waiting any longer significantly reduces the overall value. Accepting now secures a decent amount, even if slightly less than initially hoped.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can get a better deal in subsequent rounds. Bob might become more aggressive, and inflation will continue to erode the value."
