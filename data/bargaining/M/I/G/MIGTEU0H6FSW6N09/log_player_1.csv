"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Think about it! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the effective amount I gain is $57 (60 - 3%).

I'm not sure what Bob's gain is worth, but I can see that he's offering a 70-30 split.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the effective amount I gain is $54.75 (57 - 2.25%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, hoping to find a mutually acceptable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but not that big. You're getting close to my limit! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I gain is $43.10 (60 - 16.90).

I'm not sure what Bob's gain is worth, but I can see that he's offering a 75-25 split.

Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'll take this offer. It's a relatively good deal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
