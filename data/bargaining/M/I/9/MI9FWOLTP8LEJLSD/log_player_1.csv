Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more evenly, Alice. Time is ticking and the value is decreasing!

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a good deal for both of us.  We need to agree soon before inflation eats away at the value! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Although the deal is getting closer to an even split, Bob is overestimating the impact of inflation on my gains and undervaluing my position. I'm willing to wait and see if he becomes more reasonable."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer reflects the time pressure we're both under. Take it or leave it.""

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.  Take it before we both lose! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob is finally realizing the impact of inflation on his potential gains. Accepting the 50/50 split now ensures I get a fair share before inflation further diminishes the value for him.  Delaying any further is too risky, even if it means potentially getting a slightly better deal."
