"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 60-40 in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to think carefully about the offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer to move forward."
