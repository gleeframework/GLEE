"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, I'll take the risk of inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $100,000. My message is a friendly reminder that I'm taking on the risk of inflation, implying that I'm willing to take a larger share now to mitigate the potential losses due to inflation later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too greedy, now it's my turn to make a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to calculate the actual amounts I'll receive:

* My share: 200,000 * 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = 160,000
* Bob's share: 800,000 * 0.9 (10% less due to inflation) = 720,000

I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Middle ground, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. My message is a friendly suggestion that we meet in the middle, implying that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not going to be left with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* My share: 450,000 * 0.516 (48.8% less due to inflation from the original 100%) = 232,400
* Bob's share: 550,000 * 0.727 (27.1% less due to inflation from the original 100%) = 399,650

I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather have a smaller share now than risk waiting for further inflation."
