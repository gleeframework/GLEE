"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. It's a good starting point for a long game.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still a reasonable amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of 2000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, due to the 20% inflation.

I'll reject this offer. The offer is too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 80% = 64%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3840,
  ""bob_gain"": 6160,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up much more. I think I deserve a bigger share, and you're not giving me enough. I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize, but that's it. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of 1000 is worth 40.8% of what it was in the first round (100 / 10,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8064 = 0.408), due to the cumulative inflation.

I'll reject this offer. The offer is still very skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share.
