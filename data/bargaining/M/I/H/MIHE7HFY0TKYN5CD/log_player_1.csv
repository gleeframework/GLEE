I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  Let's see if Bob is willing to be a bit more fair."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split. It's still not ideal, but the inflation is making it less appealing to keep rejecting. I'll take it and end the game before the money is worth even less."
