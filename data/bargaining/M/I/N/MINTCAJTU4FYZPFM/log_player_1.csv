"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $600,000, which is 60%. This is a generous offer, considering that I'm taking on more risk by going first. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly, minimizing the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn - let's close this deal quickly. This is better for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and only 10% less for Bob, I'm more motivated to end the game quickly, but I'm not willing to settle for $450,000 just yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $480,000 and taking $520,000 for myself. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, considering the inflation. My message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer, ending the game before the inflation worsens. I've taken into account that the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, so I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
