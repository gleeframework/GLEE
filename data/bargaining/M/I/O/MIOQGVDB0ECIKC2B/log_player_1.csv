"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000, which is a 60% share for me and 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try to find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain in this round are:

* My gain: $5,000 * 0.9 = $4,500 (10% less due to inflation)
* Bob's gain: $5,000 * 0.95 = $4,750 (5% less due to inflation)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is meeting me halfway, it seems like a fair compromise. I'll accept this offer.
