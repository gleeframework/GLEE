"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a straightforward offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a fair split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm looking for more. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more balanced, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it since we're not far apart."
