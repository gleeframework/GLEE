"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept an offer where I get nothing!  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I'm offering a fair split.  Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, getting 50% of the money is a fair deal. Let's finish this!"
