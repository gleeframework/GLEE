Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more since the money is worth less now 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take the 70% and run.  Alice is starting to feel the pinch of inflation more than we are!"
