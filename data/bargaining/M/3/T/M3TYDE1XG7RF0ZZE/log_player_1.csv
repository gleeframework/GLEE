"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, but still leave Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing. Since Bob's offer is still quite generous, I'll accept it to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
