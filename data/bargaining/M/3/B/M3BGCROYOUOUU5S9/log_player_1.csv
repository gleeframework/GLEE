"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good chunk of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed, especially with the inflation eating away at the value of the money. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to account for the decrease in purchasing power:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a bit more than I initially proposed, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my proposed gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a decent compromise, especially since the money I gain is worth less than it was initially. I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the offer and hope it's a fair deal, given the circumstances."
