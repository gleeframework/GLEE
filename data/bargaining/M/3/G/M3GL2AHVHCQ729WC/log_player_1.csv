"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
 I propose to keep 9000$ for myself and give 1000$ to Bob. This way, I get a good portion of the money while ensuring Bob still gets something.  We can negotiate further if he doesn't like this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8200 
# Bob gain: 1800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not a fair division considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm offering to take 8500$ and give 1500$ to Bob. This offer reflects the inflation that has occurred, and it's still a good deal for Bob considering the circumstances. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8380 
# Bob gain: 1620 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'm losing out on a significant amount due to the inflation, Bob's offer is the best I've received so far. The money I gain is still worth more than what I would get if I rejected and continued to the next round. It's time to accept and end the game."
