Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair initial offer, as I'm taking the risk of starting the game.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation has already significantly reduced the value of the money. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best course of action to avoid losing everything."
