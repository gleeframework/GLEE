"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but I'm aiming for something more balanced this time.  This offer considers the time-value of the money.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. Rejecting it was the right move, as the decreasing value of the money incentivizes a quick agreement.
* **My offer:**
    *  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a more reasonable starting point, acknowledging that a 50/50 split in later rounds would be less beneficial to me due to the faster inflation rate I face.
    * **The message:** I'm aiming for a collaborative tone, acknowledging her previous proposal while firmly steering towards a more equitable outcome.  Mentioning the ""time-value of money"" subtly hints at the consequences of drawn-out negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle this time. A 50/50 split seems fair considering the inflation we've experienced. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's position:** The inflation is hitting Alice much harder than me. Her offer of a 50/50 split, while nominally equal, actually favors me significantly due to the decreased value of the money for her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in future rounds is extremely risky.  The longer the game goes on, the more the money depreciates, especially for Alice. There's a good chance she might become more desperate and offer even less favorable terms in a later round.
* **Fair Outcome:** While I could try to squeeze out a slightly larger share, accepting the 50/50 split ensures a relatively quick and fair resolution."
