"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

This offer gives me a large share, acknowledging the higher inflation rate for Bob.  It's likely he'll reject, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation rates. Accepting ensures we both get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
