"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too much, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the first round, I proposed a 50/50 split, which would have given me $5,000. With a 5% decrease, that's equivalent to $4,750 in the second round.

Bob's offer of $4,000 for me is less than what I would have gotten in the first round, but considering the inflation, it's actually a decent offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
