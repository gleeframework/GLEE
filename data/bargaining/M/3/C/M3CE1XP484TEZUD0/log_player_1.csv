"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars, leaving Bob with 40 dollars. The message is a friendly reminder that it's his turn to make an offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering your offer in the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's new offer:

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 40 / 0.8 = 50 dollars (due to 20% less value)
* Bob's gain: 60 / 0.95 = 63.16 dollars (due to 5% less value)

Considering the reduced value, I think Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards his favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the split, Bob. I'll make a new offer in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm still looking for a fair split, Bob. Let's try again!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55 dollars, leaving Bob with 45 dollars. The message is a friendly reminder that I'm still looking for a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation.  Let's make a deal before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the reduced value:

* My gain: 30 / 0.488 = 61.54 dollars (due to 48.8% less value)
* Bob's gain: 70 / 0.8626 = 81.19 dollars (due to 14.26% less value)

Considering the reduced value, I think Bob's offer is still not very favorable to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the split, Bob. I'll make a new offer in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. It's getting harder to make ends meet with inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the current economic conditions."
