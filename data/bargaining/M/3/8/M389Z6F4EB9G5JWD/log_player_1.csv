Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  I'm offering you a 45% share, which is still a good deal for you, considering inflation will eat into your share more than mine each round. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
