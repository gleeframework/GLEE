"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair deal, 60% for me, and we can end this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that.  I'm offering you a 45% share, which is still a good deal for you, considering inflation will eat into your share more than mine each round. Let's end this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. Let's meet in the middle... of my original offer 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still better than what I can get in the next round, given that her share will be worth even less.  Let's end this now."
