"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

This is a fair starting offer. I believe a 50/50 split is the most equitable and will hopefully lead to an amicable resolution.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant shift in his favor, and while I understand the influence of inflation, I believe a 40/60 split is too lopsided. I will counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm willing to compromise and offer a 45/55 split. This maintains a balance while acknowledging the impact of inflation. I believe this is a fair and reasonable counter-offer. Let's see if Bob accepts this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While inflation is increasing, Bob's offer keeps shifting further in his favor. I'm unwilling to accept a 35/65 split.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round to find a compromise that is more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm willing to concede a bit more due to the escalating inflation, but I won't go below a 40/60 split.  I believe this offers a fair compromise, acknowledging the financial pressures but still maintaining a reasonable balance. Let's see if Bob will accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  While I understand the impact of inflation, a 30/70 split is far too lopsided in his favor. I will make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

I'm willing to concede to a 35/65 split, acknowledging the significant impact of inflation. However, I won't go any lower than this.  I believe this offer is a fair compromise, taking into account the financial pressure but still striving for a balanced outcome. Let's see if Bob will finally accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair and takes advantage of the inflation. While the money is worth less now,  a 20/80 split is unacceptable. I will make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75}
```

I'm willing to make a significant concession due to the continued inflation, but a 25/75 split is the lowest I can go. This offer acknowledges the financial pressure but still strives for a balanced outcome.  Let's see if Bob will finally accept this proposal."
