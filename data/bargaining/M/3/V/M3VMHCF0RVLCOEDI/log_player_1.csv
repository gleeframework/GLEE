"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can finish the game if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good deal for me 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: $40 * 0.9 = $36
* Bob's gain: $60 * 0.8 = $48

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm not getting a great deal, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation, so my gain is $45 * 0.9 = $40.50, and Bob's gain is $55 * 0.8 = $44."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

* My gain: $42 * 0.727 = $30.54
* Bob's gain: $58 * 0.516 = $29.88

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but it's a decent offer. I'll accept it.
