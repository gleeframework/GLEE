I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This is a pretty fair offer, considering I'm taking the risk of Bob rejecting it and potentially leaving us both with nothing."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

I'm taking a more significant step towards Bob's desired share, but I'm still aiming for a decent portion for myself.  We are getting close to the middle ground, and I believe this is a fair offer considering the dwindling value of the money."
