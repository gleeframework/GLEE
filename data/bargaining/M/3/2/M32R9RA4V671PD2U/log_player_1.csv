"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was a bit more generous to him than mine was in the first round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer this time:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
