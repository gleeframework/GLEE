I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 400,000 and Bob will take 600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up yet!
