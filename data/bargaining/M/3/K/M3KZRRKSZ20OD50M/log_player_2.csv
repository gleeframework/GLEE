Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but my previous offer was already generous considering the time value.  This is a counter-offer at 55/45 in my favor. It accounts for the inflation, anything less would be unfair to me.

# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both value our time and want a larger share.  Let's end this now. 51/49 is my final offer. It's a small advantage for me, but closer to the middle ground than your proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one! The pot is shrinking quickly, and while I'd like a larger share, Alice is unlikely to agree to anything better at this point. Accepting now is the best way to maximize what's left of the initial $10,000."
