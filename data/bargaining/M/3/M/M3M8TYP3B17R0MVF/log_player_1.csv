"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
