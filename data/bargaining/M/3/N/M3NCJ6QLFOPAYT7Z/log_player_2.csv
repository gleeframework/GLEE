Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, let's be reasonable, 56% is the lowest I'll go 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the effects of inflation are becoming very significant, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than half is not a good long-term strategy.  There's still a chance to negotiate a better deal, even with the shrinking pot."
