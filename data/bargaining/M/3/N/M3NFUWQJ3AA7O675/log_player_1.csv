"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $200,000. This is a relatively generous starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving up 90% of the remaining amount. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal. Given the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining amount, leaving Bob with 45%. This is a more moderate proposal, hoping Bob will find it more acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up so much, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings now.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 70% of the remaining amount. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm getting a bit concerned that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

Given the inflation and Bob's previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal. I'll aim to take a larger share, but still be mindful of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take control, I'm willing to make a strong move""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the remaining amount, leaving Bob with 55%. This is a more assertive proposal, hoping to catch Bob off guard and gain an advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings now.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining amount. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that if I reject this offer, the remaining amount will be worth even less due to further inflation.

I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits. Given the current state of the game, I think it's time to accept this offer and lock in what I can get.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
