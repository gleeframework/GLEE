"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount to start with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But I think a 60/40 split is more appropriate given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject his offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think a 60-40 split is still a bit too skewed in his favor, considering the potential for inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me, but I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer was 60-40 in my favor. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
