"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I'm looking for a bit more. Your turn is next, but I'm not getting less than 2000. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob $8,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
