"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $7,000, you get $3,000. This is a generous offer considering the money will be worth less as time goes on - especially for you! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next!  It's a pretty lopsided deal, and I'm curious to see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly.  Let's each take $6,000. This is a fair deal, and we can both walk away with a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out!  My last offer was more than fair. I'll take $6,500 and you get $3,500.  Let's close this deal before the money is worth even less! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred an even split, Alice is right about the diminishing value of the money, especially for me. Accepting this offer secures a decent amount, even with the inflation."
