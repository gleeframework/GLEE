"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that inflation will likely work against me in the coming rounds.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While 500,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can do better. I'm still in a good position to negotiate given the inflation affecting Bob more than me.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to push for a larger share in this round, since Bob seems to be feeling the pinch of inflation more than me.  A 70/30 split feels like a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While inflation is hitting me harder now, it's hitting Bob much harder. I'm still in a better position to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better deal than 400,000.  I'm going to hold out for something closer to a 60/40 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm confident that Bob is feeling the effects of inflation more acutely than I am.  I'm hoping this offer is appealing enough to him to avoid further negotiation."
