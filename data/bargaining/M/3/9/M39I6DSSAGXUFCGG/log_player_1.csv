"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid unnecessary negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect in mind, I'm not as eager to accept this offer as I was in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this, and I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation effect and Bob's previous offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You were too greedy last round, I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
