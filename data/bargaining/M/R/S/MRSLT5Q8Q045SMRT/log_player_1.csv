**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer will significantly erode the potential gains for both players.
* **Downward Trend:**  Bob's offers have been getting progressively less favorable for him. There's a chance his next offer might be even worse, leaving me with even less.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a specific amount. Rejecting risks getting a worse offer and further devaluation of the money.

It's a tough decision, but the rapid inflation makes securing a reasonable amount now the more strategic option."
