"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Time is money, and yours is losing value. This offer is still fair.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand time is money, but I'm losing more value with every round. Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share than before. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate and undervaluing his share significantly due to the inflation. While his offer seems like a ""compromise,"" it's heavily skewed in his favor when considering the actual value he's receiving.  We can likely push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I see you're feeling the pressure. Let's meet in the middle. This offer accounts for the time pressure and gives us both something.""
