"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm leaving room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you'll still have to make a concession 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, especially considering the significant difference in our gains. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $600,000 and leave you with $400,000. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and leaving Bob with a reasonable amount, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. I'll carefully consider Bob's new offer.

After thinking about it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better than my previous one, and I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'm starting to run out of rounds, though..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll take $550,000 and leave you with $450,000. Let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but I'm also aware that I need to be realistic about the remaining rounds and the decreasing value of the money."
