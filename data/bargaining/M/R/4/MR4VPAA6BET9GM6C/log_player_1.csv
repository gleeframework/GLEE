"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can work with this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's asking for 80% of the money, which is a huge increase from the initial offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject this offer and make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself this time.""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I get 45% of the $100 and Bob gets 55%. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal than the previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer again. He's still getting a larger share of the money, and I'm not willing to accept a 65-35 split. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll reject this offer and try to make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's see if we can find a compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, where I get 40% of the $100 and Bob gets 60%. I'm trying to find a middle ground again, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
