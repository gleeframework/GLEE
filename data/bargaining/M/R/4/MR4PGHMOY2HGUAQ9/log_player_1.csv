"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. I think it's a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred to keep more, it's in my best interest to accept. If I reject, the money will be worth less in the next round, and I risk getting an even worse offer."
