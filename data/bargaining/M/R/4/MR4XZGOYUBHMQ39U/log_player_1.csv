"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss more in the next round if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, Alice. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's trying to negotiate!

Considering the inflation, the money I would gain in Round 2 is worth 90% of what I would have gained in Round 1. So, I'll calculate my gain in Round 2 as $600,000 * 0.9 = $540,000.

Now, let's look at Bob's offer:

* Bob's gain: $900,000 (which is worth the same as in Round 1)
* My gain: $100,000 (which is worth 10% of my original gain in Round 1)

This is a very unbalanced offer, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 81% of what I would have gained in Round 1 ($600,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $486,000).

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the ratio, Alice. I think I'm being generous here. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate my gain in Round 4:

$600,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $486,000 * 0.9 = $437,400

Bob's offer is:

* Bob's gain: $700,000 (worth the same as in Round 1)
* My gain: $300,000 (which is worth 68.5% of my original gain in Round 1)

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's still a very unbalanced split. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.
