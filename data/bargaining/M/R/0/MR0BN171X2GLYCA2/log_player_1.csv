"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. I think this is a fair offer, considering I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still giving Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I propose we split the money 720,000 for me and 280,000 for Bob.  This offer is slightly less than my original proposal, but accounts for the inflation. I believe this is still a fair deal considering the money is worth less now for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I will accept this offer. Even though the money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, getting 550,000 dollars is better than risking getting even less in the next round."
