"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. How about a 51/49 split to start? I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is worth less for Bob, so I'll have to be careful not to give away too much.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like to get a bit more. How about 55/45?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than before, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's getting late, and we both need to agree. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, 27.1% inflation is a big hit for Bob!

Considering the significant drop in value of Bob's share, I think I can afford to be a bit more generous. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a 50/50 split, and I think it's a fair deal considering the circumstances."
