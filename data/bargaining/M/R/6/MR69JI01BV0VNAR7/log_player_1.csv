Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation. We both get a good amount of money.

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a little more, but this is the most I can offer. We need to reach a deal before time runs out. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking advantage of my losses due to inflation.  While his offer is tempting, I need to hold out for a better deal. The closer we get to the deadline, the more pressure there is on Bob to offer something more acceptable."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging further on my share. It's your turn to be reasonable. We both lose if we don't reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to strong-arm me into taking a bad deal.  He's banking on me panicking as the deadline approaches. However, I need to remain firm. Accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than my fair share, even accounting for inflation.  I'm willing to gamble that Bob will become more reasonable as we get closer to the final rounds."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting tired of this game. This is my final offer, or we both get nothing. Accept it before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. Bob is clearly playing hardball and this offer is much lower than I'd like. However, getting nothing is a terrible outcome. 

That said, I'm betting Bob is bluffing. He has more to lose than I do at this point as my inflation rate makes the difference between his offer and nothing increasingly negligible to me. I need to show I'm willing to risk it all to call his bluff.  He's likely to panic in the next round and offer something better."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, you want to play rough?  Let's split this right down the middle.  Take it or leave it, but time is almost up for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only a few rounds left, I need to make a bold move. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm calling Bob's bluff. He claimed his previous offer was final, but he has a lot more to lose now than I do if we reach no deal.  He might be stubborn, but he's not stupid. This puts the pressure back on him.  He can either accept a fair deal, or risk getting nothing at all."
