"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering you 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll get the remaining $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer was rejected, and now Bob is making a new proposal.

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the new proposal. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40% of the remaining value, which is $40, and I'll get the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the new offer, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd get in this round. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the $100 is now worth $51.2.

In this round, I'd get $55, which is more than half of the new value.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point."
