"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll need to consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer. My current gain of $400,000 is worth less than my gain of $500,000 in the previous round, so I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% less than the previous round), I'll aim to get a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm offering a 55/45 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

I'll calculate the value of my potential gain in the current round, taking into account the cumulative inflation. My gain of $450,000 is actually worth more to me than my previous gain of $550,000 in Round 3, since it's less affected by inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
