Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing the decreasing value of the money. It's a fair compromise, as we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
