"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This is a pretty generous offer, considering the initial amount of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a more conservative offer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
