"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer.  Since the money is losing value, I want to get as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a ridiculous offer, but I'm going to reject it. Even though I get nothing in the first round, inflation will hurt Bob more. I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to propose the same offer as before. Since inflation is working in my favor, I'll try to get the majority of the money again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting only $1, it's better than nothing. Inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, and the next round is no guarantee that I'll get anything at all.  I'll take the $1 and run."
