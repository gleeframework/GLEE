Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take a bigger share now than risk losing more to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation hitting her harder. However, accepting $4,400 now when my share is only devaluing by 18.55% is not ideal.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but not be pushed around.  There's still time for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. The clock is ticking and this is the fairest offer for both of us considering the inflation. 50/50, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball and signal I'm serious.  Offering a 50/50 split is the fairest deal and highlights that continued negotiation will only hurt us both. This puts the pressure on Alice to accept a reasonable deal before the inflation eats away at the value further."
