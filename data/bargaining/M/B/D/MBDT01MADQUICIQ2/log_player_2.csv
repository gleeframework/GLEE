Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to a deal 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offers are getting better, but she's still getting the lion's share even with the inflation. It's risky, but I'll hold out for a slightly better deal.  The inflation hurts her more than me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's end this. 50/50 is the fairest split, especially with the time pressure and inflation working against you.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm holding firm on a 50/50 split.  It's becoming a battle of nerves. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the decreasing value, and a 50/50 deal is clean and fair. It eliminates the risk of getting to the end with no deal at all."
