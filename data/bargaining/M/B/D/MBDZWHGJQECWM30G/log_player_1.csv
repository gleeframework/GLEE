"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm not sure I want to settle for 60. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to settle for 60. Let's try to do better.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a proposal for Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a bigger share!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal, but I'm not giving away too much yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value fast due to inflation! I'd better think carefully about this offer. With the money worth 14.26% less for Bob, his offer is actually a good one. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take 70. It's a good deal considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm hoping I made the right decision!"
