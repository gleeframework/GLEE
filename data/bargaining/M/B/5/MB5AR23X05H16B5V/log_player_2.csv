"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's see what you think! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to try to get a more favorable division of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'll try to get a larger share to account for the decreasing value.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal due to the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation issue, but I'm not comfortable with a 40/60 split.  Let's try a 60/40 split.  This is closer to my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, 4000 is now worth less than it would have been in the initial rounds. I need to try to secure a better deal to compensate for the loss in value.

Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, trying to find a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Since the money is now worth 36% less for me, I need to aim for a larger share to make up for the loss.

{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your last proposal. Let's try to find a mutually acceptable deal before the value drops further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. We're both losing value with each round, and this is the fairest solution considering the inflation.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (59.04% less than the initial round), accepting the 50/50 split seems like the best option at this point. If I were to reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the value would decrease even further, making it even less favorable. Accepting this offer ensures that I get at least some value, even if it's not the best deal I could have gotten in earlier rounds."
