"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think this is a good starting point that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a fair starting point, I think I can get a better deal, especially since Alice's money is worth less with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, and it avoids the risk of further inflation. Let's agree and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  The inflation is hitting Alice much harder than me, so I think she'll be more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my initial stance - I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split. Let's not forget, your money is losing value much faster than mine. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which is still fair considering the inflation we're dealing with.  Let's avoid the risk of losing more value by coming to an agreement.""}
