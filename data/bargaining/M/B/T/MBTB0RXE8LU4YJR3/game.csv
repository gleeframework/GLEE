,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more even split this time.  Consider the inflation working against you - taking a deal sooner is better than holding out for an unlikely ideal.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share due to inflation. Let's split the difference from the last round.  If you reject this, I'm not sure how much longer we can keep playing.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges your initial advantage but also reflects the time pressure. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,

6000.0,4000.0,"I'm sticking to my guns. This is my final offer.  If you reject it, we both lose out to inflation, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal later on.",Alice,5,

3800.0,6200.0,"Alice, you're right about the risks of inflation, but they affect you far more than me. I'm holding firm on this offer. It's time to be realistic and close this deal before we both lose out.",Bob,6,
