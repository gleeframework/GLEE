"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60 dollars, leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my gain to account for the reduced value. I'll calculate the effective gain in the second round, considering the 20% decrease in value.

My effective gain would be 40 / 0.8 = 50 dollars (since 20% of 40 is 8, and 40 - 8 = 32, and 32 / 0.8 = 40, but considering the inflation effect, 40 dollars in the second round is equivalent to 50 dollars in the first round).

I'll reject Bob's offer since I'd be getting less than my initial proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the decrease.

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
I'm offering to take 55 dollars, leaving 45 dollars for Bob."
