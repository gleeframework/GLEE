Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this split is more fair, reflecting the fact that I'm taking the risk of rejection in this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm thinking... Bob's offer is tempting since he's getting more of the 'inflated' money. However, I need to consider the future rounds.
