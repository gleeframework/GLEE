"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair start. If he accepts, we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my effective gain would be $8,500, but I'm not sure what the inflation rate is for Bob.

I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $9,500 in real terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and end this soon.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a slightly better deal than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give up yet. Let's see if we can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the 14.26% inflation, my effective gain would be $8,620 (10,000 x 0.8626).

Considering the offer, I think it's a good idea to accept this 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and it's better than risking going to the next round with further inflation.
