"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In terms of the actual value of the money, Bob is offering me 49 dollars, which is equivalent to 60 dollars in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit generous, and I'm willing to accept it. So, my answer is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
