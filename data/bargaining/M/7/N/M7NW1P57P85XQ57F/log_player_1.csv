"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Inflation means the money will continue to lose value, and I'm not sure what Bob's next offer will be. A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome, especially considering the risk of getting less in future rounds."
