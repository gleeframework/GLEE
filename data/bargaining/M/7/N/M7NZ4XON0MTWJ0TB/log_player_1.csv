Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be fair - I'll take a slight advantage this round, and we can avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  You're losing value every round. My turn to propose a slight advantage for me, and we can wrap this up.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  We both lose if this drags on. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob is experiencing significant inflation. While a 50/50 split might have seemed unfair to him earlier, the decreasing value of the money makes it more appealing now.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal is risky. If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable payout."
