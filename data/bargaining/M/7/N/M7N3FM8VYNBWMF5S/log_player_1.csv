Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will accept and we both get a good share. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a bad deal for me. While I only lose 20% of my potential gain, Bob is only losing 5%.  I'm not going to accept such a lopsided split, especially so early in the game.  I'll make my own proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to lower my offer a bit, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  Bob rejected my initial offer, so it's clear he's aiming for a more equal split. I'll offer a 70/30 split, hoping he'll accept this as a fair compromise."
