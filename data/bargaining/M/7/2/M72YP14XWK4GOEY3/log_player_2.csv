Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round.  This is my final offer, and it's fair considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough one! Here's why I choose to accept, even though it's not ideal:

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer this drags on, the less my share is actually worth due to the steep inflation I'm facing.
* **Alice's Resolve:** Her message implies this is her final offer.  She's likely to dig in, and I risk getting even less in later rounds.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  While $4,000 is much less than I wanted, it's better than the risk of walking away with nothing if we can't reach an agreement. 

Let's cut our losses and take the deal.
