I'm offering a 5500/4500 split, giving me a slight advantage. I think this is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate in later rounds if necessary.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to get a larger share now that he has the power. I'll take my chances and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  With inflation hitting, I think a fair and equal division is the best way to go. Let's see if Bob is ready to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy! I'm not going to settle for such an unfair split, even with the inflated value. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

This time, I'm offering a 4500/5500 split.  I'm still trying to get a fair deal, but I'm acknowledging that the inflation is affecting the value of the money. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."
