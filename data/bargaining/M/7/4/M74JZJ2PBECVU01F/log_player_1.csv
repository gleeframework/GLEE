I'm going for a big initial share, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept quickly.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a fair split, I'm still confident I can get a better deal for myself. The inflation rate is hurting me more than Bob, so I need to get more in this round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a slightly less extreme split than round 1, but still aiming for a significant share. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something now, rather than risking further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more favorable for him, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still trying to maintain a sizable portion. The inflation is biting now, but I believe I can still get a good deal if I'm strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hurting me significantly, I still believe I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is very favorable to him, but I'm not giving up yet. I need to keep pushing for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm making a final push for a larger share, but realizing I need to be more realistic. The inflation is getting out of control, so I'm offering a more balanced split to hopefully incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard now.  I'm not happy with this split, but accepting is the best option at this point.  If I reject, the next round will see my share of the money shrink even further.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
