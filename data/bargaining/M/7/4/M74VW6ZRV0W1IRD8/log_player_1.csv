"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the one who made the first offer 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to match my fairness, but thinks he deserves a bit more for making the first offer. That's an interesting strategy!

However, considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 is actually worth 5% less than my initial offer of $6000. So, I'm not as happy with this offer as I was with the first one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that my gain is worth 5% less due to inflation. I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my gain! With a 14.26% decrease, my gain of $4500 is actually worth even less than I thought.

However, Bob's offer is a 55-45 split, which is a significant increase in his share. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of Bob's increasing offer and make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit impatient, I think I deserve more considering the offers you've made so far 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my gain now. With a 22.62% decrease, my gain of $4200 is worth even less than I thought.

However, Bob's offer is a 58-42 split, which is a significant increase in his share. I'm not sure if I want to give up more of the pot, but I'm also not sure if I want to continue negotiating.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a final offer that takes into account the significant inflation and the fact that Bob has been increasing his offer. I'll aim for a slightly higher share, but not so high that I leave myself with too little.
