"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given the equal starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, let's be more realistic about the split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 75-25 split is fair, especially considering I was already generous in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's find a fair split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which should be more acceptable to Bob after his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. Your turn to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! Considering the reduced value of money, I'll need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a 40-60 split, which is not significantly better than his previous offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob, as I'm not willing to accept a split that's still heavily skewed in his favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my gain is worth significantly less. I'll aim for a more aggressive split to compensate for the reduced value of money. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, Bob. No more generosity from me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be a more balanced offer considering the current value of money."
