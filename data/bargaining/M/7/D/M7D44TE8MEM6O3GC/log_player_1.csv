I'm going for a slightly aggressive strategy, hoping Bob will accept this first offer.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. It's clear Bob is aiming for a similar strategy as I was, taking advantage of the inflation.  I'll counter with a slightly more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500} 
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, recognizing that the inflation is a factor for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable offer that could lead to an agreement. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
