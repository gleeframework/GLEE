"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, and we can both still come out with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
