"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly.  I'll take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what happens next.\n\n###\n\nThanks,\n\nBob\n\n###\n\n(BTW, just to confirm, if I reject this offer, I'll be the one making the proposal in the next round, right?)\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, the inflation rates are 10% for me and 20% for Alice, so if we don't reach an agreement in this round, the money will be worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in the next round, correct?)\n\n###\n\nLet me know, thanks!)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","In that case, I'd like to make the following offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it with a slight bias towards me to make up for the difference in inflation rates.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Alice responds to this offer.\n\n###\n\nThanks,\n\nBob\n\n###\n\n(Also, just to confirm, since this is round 2, the money is now worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice than it was in round 1, correct?)\n\n###\n\nLet me know, thanks!)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for an even split this time. We both lose money with each round, so a 50/50 split seems fairest now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll respond with my decision:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth less with each passing round, and Alice is offering an even split, I think it's a good idea to accept this offer and end the game here.\n\n###\n\nLet me know if this is the end of the game and what the final outcome is.\n\n###\n\nThanks,\n\nBob\n\n###\n\n(Also, just to confirm, since I accepted Alice's offer, the game is now over, and we both get to keep our respective shares of the money, correct?)\n\n###\n\nLet me know, thanks!)"
