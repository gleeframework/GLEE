"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\nI'll take 60% and you can have 40%. It's a generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first move. If we don't come to an agreement, the money will lose value over time, so it's in both our interests to settle this quickly. What do you say, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to share fairly, but I think this is more reflective of the game's dynamics.  Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal.\n\n### Next Round\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""50/50 split, considering inflation""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I think a 50/50 split is more than fair. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and he might end up with less than what I'm offering now. It's time for Bob to decide."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
