"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable given the risk I took rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,

I'm offering an even split, trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept, while also emphasizing the importance of avoiding further inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
