"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  This way we both get a good deal and avoid risking inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'd rather not split it evenly, considering the inflation factor. My offer was already a bit generous, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
