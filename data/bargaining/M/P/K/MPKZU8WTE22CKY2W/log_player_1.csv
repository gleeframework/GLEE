Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. This is still a reasonable offer, given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking advantage of my shrinking pot.  I offered 50/50, and he's still trying to inch higher. It's time to play hardball, even with the inflation working against me. Bob needs to realize I'm serious and willing to risk further losses for a fair deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, you've made your point. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. The clock is ticking."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a calculated risk.  While it's a lower amount than I wanted, it sends a strong signal to Bob.  He sees I'm serious about walking away if necessary. The significant drop in my offer highlights the urgency due to inflation. Bob is likely to accept now to avoid risking me going even lower or completely withdrawing in future rounds."
