Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's previous offer was 40:60, I'll try to improve my chances by offering a more favorable ratio. However, I'll also keep in mind that the money is worth 20% less due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* Alice's offer: Bob gets $42, which is equivalent to $28 in the first round (42 * 0.67).
* My previous offer in round 2 was $45, which is equivalent to $30 in the first round (45 * 0.67).

I think I can do better than $28. I'll try to increase my share.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, and I want to increase my share. I'll offer a higher ratio.

{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll! 

Considering the actual value of the money, Alice's offer is equivalent to:

* Bob gets $50, which is equivalent to $20.96 in the first round (50 * 0.4196).
* Alice gets $50, which is equivalent to $20.96 in the first round (50 * 0.4196).

I think this is a fair split, considering the drastic reduction in value due to inflation. I'll take it.
