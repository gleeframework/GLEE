"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take most of the money this time, but you'll have a chance to make a better deal next round. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my offer now that the money is worth less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think it's fair for Bob to take 90% of the money, even if it's a smaller amount due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair split, considering the value of the money has decreased.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
