"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. This way we both benefit from dividing the money early. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a larger share, and I believe I can negotiate for more, especially considering the inflation factor that affects me but not Alice. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this decision to Alice and let's continue the game."

Round 2

This way, we both still benefit from an early division, but the slight adjustment accounts for my depreciating share over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but your previous offer was too skewed in your favor.  This offer gives you a slightly better deal than if you wait another round, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice has slightly increased her offer to me, considering the impact of inflation, her gain remains significantly higher than mine. Given that we have more rounds to negotiate, I believe there's room for further adjustments that could lead to a more equitable division, taking into account the depreciating value of the money for me.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this decision to Alice and let's continue the game."

Round 4

This accounts for the loss in value I'm experiencing, while still ensuring Alice receives a substantial amount. The longer we wait, the less my share is worth, so I hope we can come to an agreement soon.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're pushing this too close. I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if you wait another round.  Let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Despite the increasing pressure from inflation, Alice's offer doesn't sufficiently address the imbalance caused by the depreciating value of the money for me. With several rounds remaining, I'm willing to risk further negotiation to achieve a more equitable division, considering the unique impact of inflation on my share.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this decision to Alice and let's continue the game."

I believe this is a fair adjustment, given the unique circumstances affecting my portion of the money.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Your share is rapidly decreasing, and you're losing out by not accepting my offer.  Take this deal before your share shrinks even further! 
# Bob gain: 3300 
# Alice gain: 6700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Alice's slight increase in her offer does not adequately compensate for the rapidly decreasing value of my share due to inflation. At this point, with the money being worth 73.79% less for me, I'm highly motivated to continue negotiating for a better deal, despite the risks of further rounds potentially reducing the value even more. The difference in how inflation affects us creates a significant imbalance that I believe needs to be addressed more substantially in any agreement.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this decision to Alice and let's continue the game."

Round 8

I urge Alice to consider the unique pressures I'm under due to inflation and the importance of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement before the value decreases further.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're shooting yourself in the foot!  Every round you wait, your share is worth significantly less.  Take this offer, it's the best you'll get at this point! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Despite Alice's warnings, the offer doesn't sufficiently address the extreme impact of inflation on my share, which is now worth 83.22% less than initially. The significant difference in how inflation affects us means that Alice's gains remain unaffected, while mine are drastically reduced. Given the remaining rounds, I'm compelled to continue negotiating for a better deal, acknowledging the risk but also the necessity of trying to secure a more equitable division under these unique circumstances.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this decision to Alice and let's continue the game."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Alice's proposal, despite being framed as a last chance, doesn't adequately address the extreme depreciation of my share due to inflation, now worth 89.26% less.
