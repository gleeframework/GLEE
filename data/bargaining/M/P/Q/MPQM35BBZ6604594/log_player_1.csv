Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering a fairly lopsided split. Since I don't know how Bob thinks about money, I want to see if he'll accept a deal where he gets a small share. I'll be willing to adjust my offer in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is a significantly worse deal for me than my initial offer, it's still better than risking the next round, where my share will be worth even less."
