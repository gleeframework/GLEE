"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  There's no incentive for me to accept a 50/50 split right away. I know the money is worth less each round, so I might be able to get a better deal for myself if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's see if you can accept a deal where I take a slightly bigger share. After all, we'll both be losing money as the game goes on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your generosity, but I think we can find a more equitable split.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll take a slightly larger share this time, and we can both still walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent amount of money before it loses even more value."
