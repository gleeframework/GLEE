"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, giving me 700,000 and Bob 300,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good offer, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing with each round!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000
Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, as I'd rather have a bit more. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less than the second round), I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's getting late!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54:46 split, giving me 540,000 and Bob 460,000. I'm hoping this is more to Bob's liking!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.516 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%, and 51.2% is 51.2/100 = 0.512, but I'll use 0.516 to account for rounding) = 232,400
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.516 = 283,080

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as I'd rather have a bit more. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 77.28% less than in the first round (48.8% less than the third round, and 28.48% less than the fourth round), I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, let's settle this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, giving me 600,000 and Bob 400,000. I'm hoping this is the final offer that Bob will accept!"
