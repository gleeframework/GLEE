"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I cannot accept an offer where I receive less than half. This offer is more balanced, considering the decreasing value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I need to consider the decreasing value and potentially wait for a better offer or make a counteroffer that benefits me more in the next round. Accepting this offer might not be the best decision given the inflation rate affecting my gains more significantly than Bob's."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on my potential gains, I need to adjust my offer to maximize my benefit while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider. Since Bob mentioned wanting a more balanced offer, I'll aim for a division that reflects the differing impacts of inflation on our gains.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust for a more balanced split.""}"
