"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount to start with, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give you everything just yet! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be strategic.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $60 and hope that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."
