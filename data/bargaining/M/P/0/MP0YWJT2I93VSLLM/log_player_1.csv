"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly in half, I'll take a bit more to start.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, which is a 40% advantage to me, but still a decent starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took a bit more last round, now it's my turn to take the lead. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is 9,000 (10,000 x 0.9). Bob's offer is 4,000 for me and 6,000 for him.

I'll decide to reject this offer, as I think I can do better. My message to Bob will be:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not taking the backseat that easily!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'll take a slight edge.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 10% inflation, and I'm aiming to get a slightly higher share of the remaining 8,100 (9,000 x 0.9)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to edge me out, but I'm not backing down yet. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 4. Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is 7,010 (9,000 x 0.7833, which is 1 - 0.2167 = 0.7833, representing a 21.67% decrease from the original 10,000).

Bob's offer is 4,503 (4500 / 0.999, to account for the 1% decrease from 0.999 to 0.998, due to the 1% decrease in the total amount) for me and 5,507 for him.

I'll decide to reject this offer, as I think I can do better. My message to Bob will be:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle, no more games.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 27.1% inflation and aims for a fair split of the remaining 5,453 (7,010 x 0.7833)."
