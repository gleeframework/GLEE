"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the stakes. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most, but I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 30% I'd get, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 70% and call it a day. It's better than going into further rounds and risking getting even less!"
