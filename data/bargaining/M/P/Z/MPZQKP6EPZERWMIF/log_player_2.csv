Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer? 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and her offers are getting better for Bob.  I think there's a good chance to push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two before she starts getting truly desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's make a deal! This seems like a fair compromise.""} 

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point and Alice is clearly getting more amenable to deals that favor Bob. This offer is a slight improvement over her last one, and while it's possible she might go for something even better in the next round or two, there's also a risk that she'll get stubborn and the negotiation will stall.  This offer represents a good balance between maximizing gain and securing a deal before time runs out."
