"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $450,000 (90% of the original amount).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $405,000 (90% of the previous amount).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to a deal, but I'm still holding out for a better share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less each round, the total reduction is 0.9^3 = 0.729 (or 72.9% of the original amount). So, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $327,900 (72.9% of the original amount).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept this offer."
