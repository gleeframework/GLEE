"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but you get a small portion. We can work out a better deal later if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a good idea to start by rejecting Alice's offer.  While 1000$ is something, it's worth pushing for a better deal. By rejecting, you force Alice to make a new offer and show that you're not afraid to play the game.  The fact that the money is worth less with each round might encourage Alice to make a more generous offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair start, and we can adjust later if we need to.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's go for a 70/30 split. This gives me a slightly larger share, but it still allows you a decent amount.  We can adjust again later if you're not happy with this. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 3000$ is a good amount, it's still worth trying to get more. You know the money is losing value each round, and Alice is under even more pressure than you. By rejecting again, you show that you're not afraid to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 60/40 split. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need a decent amount too.  We're both losing money with every round, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}
