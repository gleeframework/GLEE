"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and offer Bob a measly $1. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  I'm hoping he'll be so offended by the offer that he'll reject it, giving me the chance to make a more balanced offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd love to keep playing, I'm not sure I'll get a better offer than this.  Inflation is going to eat into my potential gains quickly.  It's time to take the guaranteed $100,000, even though I'd like to have more."
