"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I need a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decreased value. I'll counter with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll need a bit more than 40""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in Round 2, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but don't think I'm done negotiating""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm not giving up yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 30, but I'm not budging 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth significantly less, I'll have to accept a smaller share. However, I'm not sure if 30 is the best I can get. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll hold out for a bit more""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 28,
  ""bob_gain"": 72,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not going lower""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up more than this."
