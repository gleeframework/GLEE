"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I propose a split of $990,000 for me and $10,000 for Bob.  This ensures I get the lion's share while still leaving Bob with a small amount, hopefully encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. With inflation, my share of the money is significantly less than in the first round, and if I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
