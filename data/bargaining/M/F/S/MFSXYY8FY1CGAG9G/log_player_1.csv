"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than before, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, I'd be getting $3,000 in a currency that's 5% less valuable than before, which is equivalent to $3,150 in the original currency. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss of value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. Your turn to decide.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, but I think I can get more. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! My gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is a significant drop.

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get $2,000 in a currency that's worth 14.26% less than the original $6,000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to $5,169 in the original currency.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than $5,169. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to make up for the lost value. Your turn to decide.""
