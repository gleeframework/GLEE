Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, Alice. This is my counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While this offer is closer to a ""fair"" split, Bob is still benefiting more from my losses to inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal, as time is working against him more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""This is the same offer as Round 1, Bob.  Time is running out - take the deal!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm returning to my original offer.  While I've lost value due to inflation, Bob has lost significantly more. The pressure is on him to accept a deal before the remaining value diminishes further."
