I'm going for a fairly aggressive first offer. I want to secure a large portion of the money, knowing that inflation will work in my favor if we need to continue negotiating.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm not sure how much more I can get. Inflation will eat away at my gains with each passing round, and there's no guarantee Bob will get any more generous. Accepting this 50/50 split seems like the safest option."
