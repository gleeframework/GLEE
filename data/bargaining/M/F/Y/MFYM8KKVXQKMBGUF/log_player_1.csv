Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn.  The inflation hurts you more than me, so let's make a deal that reflects this. This offer gives you a good amount upfront. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value decreases with every round, especially for you.  This offer gives us both a chance to walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the offer isn't terrible, I still have some leverage.  I need to signal I'm willing to wait for a more equitable deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want a sizable share.  Let's stop wasting time with these back-and-forth offers.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By round 5, the effects of inflation are becoming significant.  It's time to push for a more agreeable outcome before the value diminishes further.  A 50/50 split, while not ideal in earlier rounds, becomes increasingly reasonable given the circumstances. The message is direct, emphasizing the need for a quick resolution."
