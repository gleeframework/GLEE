Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are really hurting Bob. Accepting Alice's offer results in a loss of 18.55% compared to the initial round, but rejecting it means risking even greater losses in future rounds.  

Here's why it's a tough but necessary decision:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Every round that Bob rejects an offer, the value of his potential gain decreases significantly.
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice is likely aware of Bob's disadvantage with inflation and is using it to her advantage, pushing for a more favorable split with each round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the current offer isn't ideal, it might be the best Bob can secure at this stage. Waiting further risks Alice proposing even less favorable terms. 

While accepting means Bob gets a smaller share than he aimed for, it's better to secure something than risk getting a significantly worse deal due to the constantly eroding value of the money."
