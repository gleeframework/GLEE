Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a significant portion for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this offer is a bit more reasonable, and I'm willing to accept a 45/55 split. It's not the best deal I could get, but it's better than continuing to negotiate. I'll take the 450,000 and call it a day."
