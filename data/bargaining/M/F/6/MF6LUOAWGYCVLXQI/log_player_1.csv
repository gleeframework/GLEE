I'm going to try and get as much of the money as possible in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep fighting for more, it seems like Bob is being stubborn and the inflation is making it harder to gain more. This offer is pretty good, and it guarantees I get something, which is better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
