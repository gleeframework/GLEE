Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice, I'll try to find a balance that benefits both parties.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split. Let's come to an agreement before the money loses more value!""}\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Alice's response!\n\n###\n\nBest regards,\n\nBob\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice. \n###\n\nThanks!"
