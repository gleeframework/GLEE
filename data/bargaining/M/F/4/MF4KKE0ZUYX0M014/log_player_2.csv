"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'm offering you a good chunk, but we can negotiate in later rounds if you think it's not enough. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: In the first round, Alice has offered Bob $4500, which is less than half of the total amount. Considering that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob and 5% for Alice in each subsequent round, Bob might be hoping to get a better offer in the next round or try to negotiate for a larger share. Accepting this offer would mean Bob gets $4500, but he might be able to get more if he waits. Since the difference in the decrease of value between Bob and Alice is 5%, Bob might try to use this to his advantage in the negotiations. Therefore, Bob decides to reject the offer and proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what happens next. I'm ready for the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nIt's my turn now. Since I rejected Alice's offer in the previous round, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me. Considering the decrease in value, I want to try to get a bit more than half, but not so much that Alice would outright reject it. I'll aim for a 52% share, hoping that the extra 2% might be seen as a reasonable adjustment given the value decrease difference between us.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the value decrease, I think this is a fairer split.""}\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  The value is decreasing for both of us, so we need to be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: Now in Round 3, Alice has offered a 50/50 split. Given the decreasing value of money for both of us, this offer seems reasonable, especially considering the compound effect of inflation on the money's value. For me, the money is now worth 19% less than in the first round, and for Alice, it's worth 9.75% less. Since we're both losing value, accepting a 50/50 split now might be the most equitable solution before the value drops further. Additionally, there's a risk that if I reject this offer, Alice might offer less in the next round due to the increasing pressure of inflation. Therefore, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action to ensure a fair split before the situation worsens.\n\nPlease let me know the outcome!"
