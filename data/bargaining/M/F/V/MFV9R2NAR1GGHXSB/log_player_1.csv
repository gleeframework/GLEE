"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This is a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think this split is fair considering the inflation rate. It's not 3:2, but it's a decent compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
