"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $100,000, keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I should be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering the significant reduction in the value of my potential earnings, I'll have to be more careful. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous compared to what I could potentially get in future rounds.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
