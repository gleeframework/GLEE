Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, I think Bob's offer is fair considering inflation and the risk of him getting more if I reject."
