"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose a very lopsided deal: I take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1.  Since the money loses 20% of its value each round for me, but not for Bob, I want to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, taking 500,000 is better than the possibility of getting nothing if we continue. The inflation will only hurt me more in the future."
