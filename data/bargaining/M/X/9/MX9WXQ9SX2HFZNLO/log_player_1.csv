"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the original $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to your proposal, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round, the adjusted values are:

* My original proposal was $700,000, which is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's $700,000 * 0.95 = $665,000
* Bob's new proposal is $600,000, which is worth 95% of its original value, so it's $600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000
* Bob's new proposal is $400,000, which is worth 95% of its original value, so it's $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000

Considering the adjusted values, Bob's new offer is actually more favorable to me than my original proposal, since I would get $665,000 instead of $570,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
