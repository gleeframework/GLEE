"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'll take a slightly bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's revised offer. I was willing to split it 50/50 initially, and now he's trying to take a 7:3 ratio? I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not too big!""}

I'm trying to make a compromise by offering Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial offer, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
