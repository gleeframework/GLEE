I'm going to propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation! I'm not going to accept a deal where I get so much less.  I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."

```

I'll lower my offer to 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob.  I'm still trying to be fair, but I need to make sure I get a good share of the money before inflation eats away at it too much."

Round 5

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm getting desperate. Inflation is really starting to hurt, so I'm lowering my offer again, but I still need to get a good enough share to make it worth my while."

This is getting ridiculous!  I'm still getting a worse and worse deal with each round, and the inflation is making my share worth less and less.  I'm going to hold out for something better."

I'm going to make a final desperate attempt to get a decent share of the money. I'm offering a 50/50 split. We both get something, and it's better than ending up with nothing due to inflation."
