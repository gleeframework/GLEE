"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to test the waters""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion of the money, and keeping the majority for myself. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered me a small portion, now I'll take a bigger share, but still leave you with a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal!

Considering the inflation effect, the $4000 I would gain in this round is actually worth 90% of the $8000 I would have gained in the first round, which is $7200. This is a significant reduction.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this offer. I'd like to see if I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect still in play, the money is worth even less now. Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to find a middle ground and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said 50/50, but I think I deserve more, I'll take a bigger share, but still leave you with something 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

Let's calculate the actual value of the money I would gain in this round. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I would gain $8000 x 0.271 = $2168 less than the original $8000. So, the actual value of the $3000 I would gain in this round is $8000 - $2168 = $5832.

Considering this, I'm not too thrilled about the offer. I'd like to see if I can do better.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share for myself and being willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take most of the money, but I'll give you a small token 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation.

Let's calculate the actual value of the money I would gain in this round. Since the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I would gain $8000 x 0.395 = $3160 less than the original $8000. So, the actual value of the $2000 I would gain in this round is $8000 - $3160 = $4840.

Considering the significant reduction in value, I'm not happy with this offer. I'd like to see if I can do better.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you almost everything, but I want to keep a small token""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money at this point, considering the high inflation rate. I'm willing to give Bob almost the entire amount, but I want to keep a small share for myself."
