Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing for both of us, but more rapidly for me.  It's still beneficial for me to hold out for a better deal."

user: Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 51.2% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 29.5% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my last offer! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?
model: {""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her guns, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. While 40 is far from ideal, it's better than walking away with nothing if she's serious about this being her last offer.  The potential losses from further rounds outweigh the potential gains at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing more than me, don't be stubborn! 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally moving a bit, but it's not enough. She's trying to use the inflation against me, but even with the reduced value, holding out for a slightly better deal is worthwhile.  It's risky, but I'm betting she'll break before I do."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be real. 50/50. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to try a different tactic.  Alice seems determined to get more than me, but with the inflation rate, we're both losing significantly. Offering a 50/50 split frames it as a fair compromise and a way to stop both of us from losing out further.  It's a strong stance to take, especially if Alice believes I might reject any more offers that aren't in my favor."
