"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the money, but Bob's offer is still a significant chunk. I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a larger share of the pie. I'll take $450,000 and Bob will take $550,000."
