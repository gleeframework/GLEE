"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but don't expect me to be too generous!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I'm hoping for a fair and quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be reasonable!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since the money is now worth 20% less, the actual amounts would be:

* Alice gain: $500,000 / 0.8 = $625,000
* Bob gain: $500,000 / 0.8 = $625,000

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I suppose it's a fair split considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.
