Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too favorable towards you, Alice. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  It accounts for the decreasing value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
