"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is equal, I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations.
