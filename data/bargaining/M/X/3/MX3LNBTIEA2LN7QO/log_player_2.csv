Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Inflation is hitting us both, so it's time to be fair. Let's get this done before we lose too much more. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seemed unfair in earlier rounds due to the difference in inflation rates, it's now a reasonable deal. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer we wait, the more money we both lose. Accepting a decent offer now is better than holding out for a slightly larger share that's been diminished by inflation.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split might not be ideal for me in the long run, but it's a fair compromise considering the circumstances. 

Delaying further is too risky with the increasing inflation rate."
