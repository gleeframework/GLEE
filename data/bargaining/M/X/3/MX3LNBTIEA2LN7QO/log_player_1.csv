Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm willing to give you a generous share, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of. This is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor, considering the inflation rate. I need a more equitable split. I'll counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
