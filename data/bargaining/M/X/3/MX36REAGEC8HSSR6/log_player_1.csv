I'm starting with a proposal that favors me, hoping Bob will accept to avoid any potential inflation risk.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer a larger share, the inflation is a real risk. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a decent share, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in later rounds due to further inflation."
