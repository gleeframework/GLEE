Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of 30% for himself. I think I should get a better deal, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself to account for the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I'm getting worried about the value of my money with this inflation 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of 75% for myself. Although I was hoping for a better deal, I'm getting worried about the value of my money as well, and 75% is a decent compromise considering the inflation. I think it's better to accept this offer and move on rather than risking further negotiations that might not yield a better result."
