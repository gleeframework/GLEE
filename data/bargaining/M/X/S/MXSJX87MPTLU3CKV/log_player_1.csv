"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. Let's see if you'll accept this one! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less, so I'll get 70% of the new value, which is 70% of 90 (since 100 - 10% of 100 is 90). So, I'll get 63 dollars, and Bob will get 27 dollars.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for 63 dollars when I could potentially get more. It's still early in the game, and I'm willing to wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. But don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the new value, which is 75% of 81 (since 90 - 9% of 90 is 81). So, I'll get 60.75 dollars, and Bob will get 20.25 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, Alice, but I'm not going to give up yet! Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'll get 65% of the new value, which is 65% of 73.09 (since 100 - 27.1% of 100 is 73.09). So, I'll get 47.56 dollars, and Bob will get 36.44 dollars.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's a decent deal, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come. I'll take the 47.56 dollars and call it a day!"
