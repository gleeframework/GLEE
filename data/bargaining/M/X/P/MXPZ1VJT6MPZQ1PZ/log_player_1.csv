"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm starting with a very generous offer, giving Bob only $1.  Since I'm playing against a rational Bob, he should accept this deal to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'll reject this offer. While it seems tempting to get some money now,  the inflation will eat away at my gains in the coming rounds.  I'm still in a strong position to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but still keeping a significant portion of the money. He's likely to accept this offer because he knows that his offer was rejected and that his potential gains are decreasing with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly worse.  Even though I'm losing more value with each round, I'm still better off holding out for a better deal. I believe I can negotiate a better share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still aiming to keep the majority for myself. He's likely getting impatient with the lack of progress and might be more willing to accept a smaller portion of the money at this point."
