"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm offering you a fair deal, let's split the money evenly this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amount I'll get if I accept Bob's offer.

In this case, the actual amount I'll get is 40 * 0.8 = 32.

However, I can do better than that! I can propose a new offer that will give me a higher amount after adjusting for inflation.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll do better than that, let's try again""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less in the third round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end it here""
}
```"
