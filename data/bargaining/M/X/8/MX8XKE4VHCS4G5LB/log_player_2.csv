Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. If we don't agree now, the money will be worth even less in the next round.""} \n\n###\n\nI made this offer because I want to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round. By offering her 45% now, I'm hoping she'll accept it rather than risking an even lower value in the next round. Let's see how she responds! \n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision. \n\n###\n\n(I'll be waiting for Alice's response)"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us. I propose a 50/50 split to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""} \n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer because, considering the inflation, a 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point. The money is worth less to both of us now, but Alice is being affected more by the inflation. I think this is a fair deal, and it's better to accept it rather than risking further losses in the next round."
