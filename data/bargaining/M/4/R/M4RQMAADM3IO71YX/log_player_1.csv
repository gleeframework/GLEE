Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 6 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's offers are getting progressively worse, but the rate of decrease is slowing down.  It's unlikely he'll drastically change his offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Waiting further significantly increases the risk of getting nothing. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum, even if it's not the ideal split. 
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob's messages suggest increasing urgency. He might be less likely to concede further, especially knowing time is on his side due to the inflation impacting him less than Alice."
