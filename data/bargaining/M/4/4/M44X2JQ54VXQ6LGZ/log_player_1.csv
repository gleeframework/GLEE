"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal right now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** It's crucial to end the game quickly. The longer it takes, the less Bob's share is worth to him due to the 5% inflation. 
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Offering a slight advantage to myself (Alice) while still giving Bob a significant sum incentivizes him to accept. A 52.5% / 47.5% split achieves this.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes fairness and the immediate benefit for both parties, making it more likely for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling generous today, but let's not drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of my initial offer. While the time pressure is on, accepting this would give Bob a significant advantage. Since my share isn't affected by inflation, I can afford to wait one more round and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, time is money! This offer still gets us both a good amount, and we can wrap this up right now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Slightly:**  I'm reducing my initial ask slightly to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  This offer still gives me a slight edge while acknowledging the time pressure.
* **Emphasize Time:**  The message again reiterates the urgency due to the inflation affecting Bob's share.
* **Final Push:**  This offer is designed to be my final push.  If Bob rejects this, it's highly likely he'll propose something less favorable to me in the next round.  I'm betting he'll see this as his last chance for a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This is a fair split considering the time pressure. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 495000 
# Bob gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but accepting is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, Bob's offer is very close to my last one. Holding out for a slightly better deal in further rounds is risky, as the difference in gains will be increasingly marginal due to the inflation hitting Bob's share harder.
* **Bob's Stance:**  His message suggests he's unlikely to budge further. Rejecting this offer risks him proposing something even less favorable next round, and the decreasing value of his share might make him dig in his heels. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonably fair outcome. Continuing the game introduces more uncertainty and potentially greater losses for both of us."
