Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

 I'm taking a large portion for myself in the first round, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount.  This allows me to see if he's willing to accept a less-than-ideal deal, or if he's willing to gamble and see if he can get a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this is a significant improvement from the previous round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a good amount of money, even with the inflation.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing in a future round."
