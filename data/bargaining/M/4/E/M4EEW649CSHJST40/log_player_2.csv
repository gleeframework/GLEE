"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's tempting to accept a fair offer, but Bob has a lot to gain by holding out. He can potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split the money more evenly this time.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 55% for me seems fair 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should continue to reject.  He still has a chance to get a better deal in the next round, as the inflation is working in his favor, and Alice is losing value on her end."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""alice_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, I'm being reasonable here, 52.5% is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should continue to reject. Inflation is making his share worth more with every round. He's better off waiting to see if Alice will compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. I'm willing to take a bigger share, but I'm not budging on this offer.  Let's make a deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for 50/50, it's only fair 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though 50/50 is a ""fair"" offer, Bob should reject. The inflation is significantly impacting Alice's share of the money, and Bob is gaining more value with each passing round.  He should try to push for a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice.  It's time to be realistic.  We both stand to lose everything if we keep refusing.""
