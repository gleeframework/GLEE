"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000$ for me, 100,000$ for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, even considering inflation. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 300,000 and keep 700,000 for myself. This is still a significant gain for him, and it reflects the fact that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not afraid to walk away from a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough, even with the significant inflation factor. I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 400,000 and keep 600,000 for myself.  This offer reflects the significant inflation we're facing, and it shows I'm willing to compromise.  Let's see if Bob will finally accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, and the inflation is hitting me hard. Even though I would prefer a better deal, this is the best offer I've seen in a while.  I'll accept Bob's offer and split the money evenly."
