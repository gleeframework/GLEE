I propose to take $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I want to maximize my share as much as possible in this first round, but I also want to avoid making an offer Bob will definitely reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still quite unfair. While I am losing value due to inflation, I am still gaining 200,000 dollars, which is a significant amount. I will reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself.  I've lowered my offer to take into account Bob's inflation, but I still want to ensure I get a good portion of the money. I'm hoping this will be more enticing for Bob than his previous offer."
