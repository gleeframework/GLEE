I'm going to be greedy and take the lion's share!  I figure Bob might accept a small amount since he doesn't know about the inflation.  Let's see how it goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing a lot more money, I'm still getting something. In the next round, my gain will be worth even less due to inflation. It's better to take what I can get now."
