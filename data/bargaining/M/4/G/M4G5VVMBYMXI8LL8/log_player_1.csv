I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not interested in further negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round.

# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect any further concessions! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejected offer! I'll have to think strategically about this one. Considering the inflation rate, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, so I should take that into account.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. If I accept, I'll get 450,000, but if I reject and proceed to the next round, I might get a better deal considering the increasing inflation.

I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give in completely! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out! Considering the inflation rate, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, but I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll calculate the effective value of the offer, taking into account the inflation. Since Bob's gain is worth 40.95% less, I'll consider the offer as if it were 600,000 * 0.59605 (1 - 0.40395) = 357,63.

However, I'll make a more conservative estimate, considering that the inflation rate might be higher in the future. Let's say I'll consider the offer as if it were 600,000 * 0.5 = 300,000.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to wear me down! Considering the inflation rate, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, but I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll calculate the effective value of the offer, taking into account the inflation. Since Bob's gain is worth 52.17% less, I'll consider the offer as if it were 700,000 * 0.47583 (1 - 0.52417) = 333,781.

However, I'll make a more conservative estimate, considering that the inflation rate might be higher in the future. Let's say I'll consider the offer as if it were 700,000 * 0.4 = 280,000.

# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me! Considering the inflation rate, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, but I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll calculate the effective value of the offer, taking into account the inflation. Since Bob's gain is worth 61.26% less, I'll consider the offer as if it were 850,000 * 0.38574 (1 - 0.61426) = 327,136.4.

However, I'll make a more conservative estimate, considering that the inflation rate might be higher in the future. Let's say I'll consider the offer as if it were 850,000 * 0.3 = 255,000.

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 900000 
# Bob gain: 100000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's my last chance! Considering the inflation rate, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, but I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll calculate the effective value of the offer, taking into account the inflation. Since Bob's gain is worth 68.62% less, I'll consider the offer as if it were 100,000 * 0.31238 (1 - 0.68762) = 31,238.

However, I'll make a more conservative estimate, considering that the inflation rate might be higher in the future. Let's say I'll consider the offer as if it were 100,000 * 0.2 = 20,000.

Considering this, I'll accept the offer and take the 900,000.
