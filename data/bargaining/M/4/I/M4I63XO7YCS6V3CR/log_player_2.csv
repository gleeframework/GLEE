"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40. It's best to settle now before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better. I'll take 55, and you can have 45.  Let's split the difference and end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing with every round, Bob.  I'll take $55, you take $45.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll take the $45.  It's better than getting nothing in a few more rounds."
