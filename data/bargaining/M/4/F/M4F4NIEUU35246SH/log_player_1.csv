"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going for a slightly aggressive but fair opening offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to play nice or if he'll push for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. I'll counter with a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 80. I'm still in a strong position, but I want to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will lead to a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy. I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll counter with a fairer proposition."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering 75 for myself and 25 for Bob.  I'm trying to find a middle ground.  Bob is getting increasingly greedy, but I'm not going to give in completely. I'm hoping he'll see that this is a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'm still losing some of what I'd ideally like, Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable, and the rounds are quickly running out. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point."
