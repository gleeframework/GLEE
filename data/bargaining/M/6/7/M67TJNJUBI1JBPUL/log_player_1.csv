"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair deal?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more equitable, as we both have equal say in this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 400,000$ is now worth 360,000$.

I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that a 60/40 split is more equitable, especially since the money is worth less for me. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a stronger offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55:45""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50/50 split, but still in my favor."
