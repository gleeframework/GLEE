I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, aiming for a quick resolution while leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm reducing my share by 50,000 to try to reach an agreement, but still maintaining a significant advantage.  This accounts for the inflation and Bob's previous offer."
