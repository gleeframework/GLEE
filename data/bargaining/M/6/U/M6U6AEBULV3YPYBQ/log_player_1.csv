Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Bob's share is rapidly decreasing in value. While a 50/50 split seems like I'm losing out now, waiting longer means the overall pot is worth less to both of us. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're already in round 4, and the clock is ticking.  The longer this goes on, the worse the outcome becomes for both of us. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal later on. He might become even more insistent on a 50/50 split, or propose something even worse as the pressure increases.

It's better to secure a guaranteed win now than risk walking away with nothing."
