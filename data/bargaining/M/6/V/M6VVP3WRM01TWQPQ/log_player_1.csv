"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
