Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take a large share, but give Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation is already hitting my potential gains. It's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing later."
