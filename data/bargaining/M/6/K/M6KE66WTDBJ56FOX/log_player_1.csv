"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a pretty good offer, and Bob might be willing to accept it to get something rather than risk getting nothing later.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal for myself.  The inflation might hurt me, but it also impacts Bob, and I'm not going to settle for a 10/90 split.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a good share of the money, but I'm willing to be a little more flexible after Bob's aggressive counter-offer.  Let's see if this 80/20 split is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Even though the inflation is hitting me hard, I'm not going to give up 60% of the money just yet.  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal.  It's time to play this strategically and see if I can turn the tables."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm dropping my offer to 60/40, acknowledging the impact of inflation and Bob's willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair one given the current circumstances."
