"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but let's start with a good offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, and keeping $9,000 for myself. This way, I'm giving him a small taste of the money, and I'm keeping the majority. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we can move on to more important things. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, my gain of $9,000 in the first round is now worth $7,200 in this round. And since Bob's gain of $1,000 is worth 5% less, it's now worth $950.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a reasonable proposal. Splitting the money evenly seems fair, and it's a good opportunity to end the game early.
