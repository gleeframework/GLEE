"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
 I propose taking $90 and leaving $10 for Bob. This is a pretty generous offer, considering he can get nothing if he rejects it and we proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to get $50 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
