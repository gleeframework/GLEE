"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. Since we're dealing with inflation, I want to secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is completely unacceptable.  I'm not going to settle for just $5 when I can potentially get much more in the remaining rounds.  I will counter with a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a decent share. It's important to find a balance between securing a good amount for myself and ensuring that Bob doesn't get too frustrated and refuse to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the last one, it's still not fair. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds.  I'll keep trying to secure a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money. I'm also keeping in mind that Bob's share is being devalued with each passing round due to inflation.  Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly better than the previous one, but I am still aiming for a larger share.  I am aware of the inflation affecting Bob's gains, but I believe there is still room for a more balanced agreement. I will make my own counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm lowering my offer further, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  I'm hoping that this offer will finally be acceptable to Bob, as inflation is only going to make his potential gains smaller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is becoming more attractive due to inflation, I still believe I can negotiate a larger share. I'm determined to secure a more balanced split, and I have a few rounds left to do so."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time.  Inflation is heavily affecting Bob's potential gains now, so I'm hoping he'll accept this deal before we both lose everything."
