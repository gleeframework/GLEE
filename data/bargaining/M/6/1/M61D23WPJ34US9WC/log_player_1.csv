"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can always negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of negotiating 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think the split is still too skewed in Bob's favor, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money I gain. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the effects of inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the fairest split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise given the changing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about meeting me halfway, I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of you 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get an even better deal. I'm not willing to give up that much more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the split is still too skewed in Bob's favor, and I don't think it's fair considering the effects of inflation. I'll wait for a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the continued effects of inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle again.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a fair deal."
