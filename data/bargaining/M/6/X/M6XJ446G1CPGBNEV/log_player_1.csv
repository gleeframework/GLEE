"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the money to work with."
