"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'll make a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the original amount, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 490000, ""bob_gain"": 510000}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share to compensate for the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable considering the current value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
