I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer.  I want to maximize my share while still giving Bob something to consider.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's important to be realistic. The inflation is starting to take its toll, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer than 50/50. It's better to accept and secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
