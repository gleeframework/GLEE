"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor.  This is a more equitable division, considering the diminishing value of money. Let's reach an agreement and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
