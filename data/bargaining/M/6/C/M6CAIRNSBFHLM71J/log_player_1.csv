"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that you take $9,000 and Bob takes $1,000.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll take the $5,000. It's better than nothing, and I'm not sure I can do any better in the next rounds."
