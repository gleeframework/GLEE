"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $10,000 with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and offer a 50/50 split, considering the value of money decreases with each round. Let's split the difference and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
