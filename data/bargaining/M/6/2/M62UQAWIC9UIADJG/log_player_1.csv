"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to make it worth your while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  No need to complicate things! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject his offer for now. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less after the first round and 20% less after the second round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You said you wanted to split it evenly, but I'm willing to give you a bit less to get a better deal for myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little less to get this done. Let's agree on this and stop wasting time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me. His offer is actually better than mine from the previous round, and it's closer to the split he proposed in the second round.

I'll accept his offer.
