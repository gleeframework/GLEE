"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 60-40 in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations if Bob wants to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a good starting point. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the new values are:

* My gain would be $5,000 (10% less than $6,000)
* Bob's gain would be $4,750 (5% less than $5,000)

Considering Bob's compromise, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable starting point. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
