"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to try to get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a slightly more favorable split, but I'm still open to negotiation. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4500 * 0.95 = 4275
* Bob gain: 5500 * 0.9 = 4950

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll reject it for now and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

This offer takes into account the continued inflation and tries to balance the split."
