"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need a larger share due to the inflation affecting me more.  We need to move forward, or we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is a significant factor, but accepting a 40/60 split at this stage leaves me with significantly less value over time. It's worth risking another round to aim for a more balanced outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice.  It's a fair split considering the inflation.  Let's be practical and end this now before we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With only 8 rounds remaining, the pressure is on. I need to make a strong offer that reflects the urgency of the situation.
* **Inflation impact:** The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes. Alice, with her lower inflation rate, might be tempted to stall.  This offer is my attempt to get ahead of that potential strategy.
* **Finality:** By stating ""final offer"", I aim to make Alice seriously consider the proposal rather than simply countering with another imbalanced offer. This introduces a sense of urgency and finality."
