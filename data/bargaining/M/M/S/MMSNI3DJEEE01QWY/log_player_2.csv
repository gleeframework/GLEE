**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offer hasn't changed.  This means time is working in my favor.  I'll hold out for a better deal as long as possible."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to a fair 50/50 split. It's the most rational choice considering the circumstances.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck on her initial offer, even though the value for her decreases significantly with each round. Holding my ground at a 50/50 split maintains a sense of fairness while maximizing my potential gain. It also underscores that I understand the game's dynamics and won't be swayed by repeated, disadvantageous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are running out of time.  I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if we fail to agree. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

It's getting dangerously close to the deadline. While the offer isn't ideal, Alice is correct: getting $40 is better than getting $0 if we fail to agree. The risk of walking away with nothing now outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds."
