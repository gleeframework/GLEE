"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  While the offer is tempting, rejecting it might lead to a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were too generous last round, Bob. I'm willing to compromise this time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split,  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer means a decent gain for me, and it avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
