"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation advantage I have. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $60 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split in Bob's favor, especially considering the inflation advantage he has. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round. I'd like to make a new offer that takes this into account.
