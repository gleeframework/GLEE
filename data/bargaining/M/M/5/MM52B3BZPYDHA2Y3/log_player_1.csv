"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not too thrilled about the 20% gain I'd get from Bob's offer. However, it's still a decent offer.

I'll accept this offer for now.
