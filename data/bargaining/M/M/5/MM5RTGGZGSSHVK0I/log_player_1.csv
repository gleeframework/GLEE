Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was quite reasonable, Alice, so I'm proposing the same split but with our positions reversed.  This seems fair given it's now my turn to propose. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
