I propose I take 90$ and Bob takes 10$. I think this is fair as I am the one making the proposal, but I am also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm willing to lower my share a bit, but I think 80/20 is a fair compromise, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm going to keep lowering my share a little bit each round. I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better for him to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

Bob keeps offering me less and less, but I am still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident that I can get more than $30 in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm continuing to compromise, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I don't want to risk getting nothing, but I also don't want to give in too easily."
