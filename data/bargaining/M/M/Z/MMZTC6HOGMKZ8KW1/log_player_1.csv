"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is my offer. I'm taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  Since I get to make the first offer, I'm trying to maximize my share.  I'm hoping Bob will be desperate enough to accept it, even though it's a tiny amount for him.  But, who knows, maybe he'll be stubborn and want to make a counter offer.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much better for me than my previous offer. While the inflation hurts my gains, 500,000 is still a significant amount.  It's not worth the risk of going another round and potentially losing even more due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer."
