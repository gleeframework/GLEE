"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money into an 80/20 split, with me receiving 800,000$ and you receiving 200,000$. This offers a fair balance considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more since the money is worth less in future rounds. I'll give you 600,000 and take 400,000. It's a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
