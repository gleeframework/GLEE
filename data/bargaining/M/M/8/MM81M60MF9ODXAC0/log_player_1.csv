"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can always negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1. I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial generosity!

I'll reject this offer. My gain of 4000 is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of 6000 is now worth 5% less than in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You took a bigger share last round, now it's my turn to adjust. Let's try to find a fair split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, taking a bit more for myself this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get a bigger share!

I'll reject this offer as well. My gain of 4500 is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of 5500 is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, with me taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to back down now. Let's meet in the middle and end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to force a 50-50 split!

I'll accept this offer. Given the inflation rate, a 50-50 split is actually a relatively good deal for me, considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth significantly less.
