Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the split, but I still want a bit more. Let's settle on 57-43. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. By rejecting, Bob increases the pressure on Alice to make a more substantial concession in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the value is slipping away for both of us. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split.  Let's close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:**  By round 4, the pressure of inflation is mounting for Alice. Bob needs to reinforce that time is not on her side.
* **Concession:** Bob is offering a concession from his previous offer, making it seem more reasonable to Alice. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need for a quick decision to avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still want a slightly bigger share. Let's do 56-44. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling:** Alice's offer barely budged, suggesting she's hoping Bob will crack under the pressure of dwindling time.  
* **Leverage:** Time is working against Alice more than Bob. Continuing to reject forces her to make larger concessions. 
* **Target:** Bob's goal should be to secure a deal closer to 50/50, and he's still in a strong position to achieve that."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is as close to even as it's going to get.  Take the 490,000 while it's still worth something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Bob is now past the halfway point in the rounds. Alice's position is weakening faster with each refusal.
* **Slight Edge:** Offering a 51/49 split gives Bob a slight advantage while still presenting it as a near-even split.
* **Ultimatum Tone:** The message implies this is Bob's final offer, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept."
