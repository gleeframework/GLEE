"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""This offer represents an initial split where I'm proposing to take 75% of the total amount, and you receive the remaining 25%. This seems fair given the diminishing value of money with each passing round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This recognizes the inflation factor while also being fair. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
