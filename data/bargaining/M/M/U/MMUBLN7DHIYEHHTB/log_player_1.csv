"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 50/50. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is quite lopsided, but I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

After considering the numbers, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn now! I'll make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair deal. What's your next move?""
}
```

I've adjusted my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding out for a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve the majority now. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains! With the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll have to be even more cautious.

Considering the numbers, Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again! I'll make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'll try to hold out for a fair deal. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I've adjusted my proposal to give Bob an even larger share, but I'm still hoping for a more balanced split. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out against inflation!"
