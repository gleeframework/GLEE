"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to take a smaller share now to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation means my gains are worth less in each round, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal next time.  A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the risk of further inflation."
