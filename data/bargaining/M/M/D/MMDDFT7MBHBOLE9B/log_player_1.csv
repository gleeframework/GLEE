"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 5% less, which is $2250, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, which is $4950.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
