Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I have to make up for the lost value from the previous round. It's still a good deal for you, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
