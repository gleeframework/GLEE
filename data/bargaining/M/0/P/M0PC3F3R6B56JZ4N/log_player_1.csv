"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have 40, it's a good deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll need to be cautious about accepting an offer that gives him a larger share.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round gave him a larger share, I'll try to make a counteroffer that gives me a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority this time, you can have 45, it's a fair deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you can have 30, I'm not budging 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain being worth even less due to the increased inflation, I'll need to be careful not to give up too much.

However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I should accept it. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth even less than in the previous round, so I'll try to hold out for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to make a more moderate offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself, but not too high. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'll take 52 and you can have 48""
}
```"
