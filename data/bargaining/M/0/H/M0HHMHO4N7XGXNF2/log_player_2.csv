"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate further if you don't like it. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer seems fair at first, remember the inflation!  10% of $10,000 is only $1,000 for Bob.  It's better to see if he can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money fairly, but considering the inflation, I'd like a bit more than 10%.  Let's try 5500 for me, 4500 for you. This way, we both get a good share.""}
