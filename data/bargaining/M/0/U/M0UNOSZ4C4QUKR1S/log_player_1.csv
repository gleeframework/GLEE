"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll take it to avoid the potential losses that come with waiting for a better offer in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the money. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the money's value! Given the reduced value, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value continuing to drop, I'll aim to get an even larger share. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to get a decent share, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm reverting back to my original Round 1 offer, but with the reduced value of the money in mind. I'm hoping Bob will take it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's getting late 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money being worth only a fraction of its original value, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and split the money 50/50. At this point, I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation."
