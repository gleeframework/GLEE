"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take $600,000 and Bob will take $400,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also subtly hinting that I'm willing to take the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect too much""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is slightly more favorable to Bob than the initial offer. I'm framing it as a ""better deal"", but also hinting that I'm not willing to give up too much."
