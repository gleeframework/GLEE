Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob likes a 99.9% cut for me. ðŸ¤‘"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's less than my original offer, it's still a significant amount of money, and the inflation makes holding out for a better deal risky."
