"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40!""}\n\nI'm being generous with my first offer, but I want to make sure Bob feels like he's getting a good deal too. The 60-40 split seems reasonable, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more fair and split it 60-40 in my favor.  Let's agree to this, as the money will be worth less with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept Bob's offer of a 60-40 split in his favor. I think my initial offer was more than fair, and I'm not willing to give up that much of the money. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me but less to Bob, I have some leverage to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. Let's split it 65-35.""}\n\nSince Bob's offer in the previous round was a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll try to meet him halfway by increasing my share by 5% and decreasing his share by 5%. I'm hoping this compromise will be more acceptable to him, considering the money is worth less to him with each passing round."
