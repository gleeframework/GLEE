"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the offer is to split the $100 fairly, with both of us getting $50, I see no reason to reject this offer. It's a perfectly fair division, and there's no potential for me to get a better deal in subsequent rounds that would be worth the risk of possibly getting a worse deal. Thus, accepting this offer is the most rational decision."
