Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation pressure you're facing. This offer is a compromise to reflect that while still being fair. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is better than what I might be able to secure in a future round, considering the ongoing inflation.  It's a reasonable compromise."
