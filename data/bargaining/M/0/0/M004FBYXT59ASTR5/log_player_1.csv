"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my potential gain is worth even less now.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'm getting 40% of the remaining $100, that's $40. Considering the inflation, I'll get $40 / 0.95 (1 - 0.05) = $42.11.

I'll accept this offer.
