"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent amount to start with.  Accept this and we can both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a decent starting offer, but I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split.  Let's make this happen.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little more.  This is a good split for both of us, and it avoids further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like to get more, the inflation risk is significant now.  This seems like a reasonable compromise."
