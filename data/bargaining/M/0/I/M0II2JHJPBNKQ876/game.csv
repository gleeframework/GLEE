600000.0,400000.0,"Your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split to acknowledge your inflation disadvantage, but giving us both a more reasonable starting point.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to move closer to the middle ground, but 60/40 still doesn't feel quite balanced given the inflation rate. How about 65/35?",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. Time is literally money in this game!  I'm proposing 55/45. It's a significant move on my part and acknowledges the inflation working against you.",Bob,4,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm holding firm at 60/40.  The inflation rate is working heavily against me. You're getting a great deal considering the money will be worth significantly less for you soon if we don't agree.",Alice,5,
