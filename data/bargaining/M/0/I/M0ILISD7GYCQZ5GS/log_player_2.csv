Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure me by claiming my last offer was ""final.""  However, she's still heavily favoring herself in this deal. The inflation is hurting me, but I need to hold out for a more equitable split. Accepting now would set a weak precedent and likely lead to an even worse outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm not accepting a deal where I lose significantly to inflation. This is a compromise, and it's the closest we'll get to a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, but I still believe I deserve a larger share 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical.  While this offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking an even worse deal in the remaining rounds due to the increasing impact of inflation. Alice is clearly holding out for a larger share and might not be willing to budge much further.  It's better to secure something now than potentially end up with nothing."
