Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm increasing my share. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot, but holding out is still (barely) the better strategy. 

* **Alice is getting greedier:**  She knows time is on her side and is pushing for a larger share.
* **Next round is critical:** If I reject this round, my offer in round 6 will likely have to be close to 50/50 to be accepted, as the value for me will have diminished further. 

It's a gamble, but I'm hoping Alice might be willing to accept a slightly less favorable deal in round 6 to avoid risking everything in a final round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Let's end this now and both get a good deal.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The risk of inflation is too high to push further. I need to make a compelling offer now.  

* **Minimize losses:** Waiting any longer significantly diminishes my potential gains. 
* **Appear decisive:** Offering a slight advantage to Alice, while still securing a decent amount, might be enough to convince her to settle.

This is a calculated risk, as rejecting this would leave me with a drastically reduced share in a potential final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. The inflation is killing your share. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but I have no choice. 

* **Inflation has crushed me:** Accepting this offer still gives me something, whereas rejecting it means the next round will be even worse.
* **Alice holds all the cards:** She knows I'm desperate and has no incentive to offer anything better. 

This is the price of miscalculating the negotiation."
