Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we need to take into account. Let's agree on this and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
