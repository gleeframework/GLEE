Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, but 55/45 is still too lopsided.  Let's split it 60/40.  This is a more balanced compromise.
