"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio, with you receiving $400,000. I believe this is fair given the diminishing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 50/50, considering the decreasing value of money. This way, we both get an equal share, and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
