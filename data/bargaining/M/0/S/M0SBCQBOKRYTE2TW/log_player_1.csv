"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable ratio""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe 60/40 is a more equitable split considering the potential for future inflation.  Let's work together to ensure a fair outcome. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $320,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is equivalent to $480,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60:40 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round, due to the cumulative 20% inflation. I'll take this into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55:45""
}
