"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. I'll take 60 this time, but I'm open to negotiation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less after inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
