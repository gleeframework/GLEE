"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

This offer gives me a very large majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a small amount.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as the potential for inflation could mean he gets less in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, the inflation factor is significant.  A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances, and accepting now guarantees me a substantial amount."
