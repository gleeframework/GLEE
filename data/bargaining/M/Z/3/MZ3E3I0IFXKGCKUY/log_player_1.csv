"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, this offer leaves us both with a significant sum. Let's settle this quickly and avoid losing value to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening Offer:** Starting with a 65/35 split in Alice's favor is assertive but not outrageously unfair. 
* **Emphasis on Time:** The message highlights the shared loss from inflation, encouraging Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later. 
* **Future Leverage:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice knows he values his share quite a bit and may be willing to concede more in later rounds to offset his slower inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a more balanced split is fair.  We both need to consider the impact of inflation. This offer gives you a decent share while recognizing my advantage in this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's message sounds reasonable, the math doesn't favor Alice. Here's why:

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob's offer is a significant shift in his favor compared to Alice's initial offer. 
* **Inflation Disparity:** While both players are affected by inflation, Alice loses value at a much faster rate (20% vs. Bob's 5%). Accepting this offer means Alice takes a big hit from inflation while Bob remains relatively unaffected.
* **Potential for Better Terms:** By rejecting, Alice forces Bob to make another offer in a future round where his share will be worth even less due to inflation. This gives Alice leverage to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're both losing out by dragging this on. My revised offer still gives you a good chunk, and settles things now before inflation eats further into our potential gains."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but with a Limit:** Alice concedes slightly from her initial 65/35 offer, recognizing that Bob is holding out for more. However, she avoids a drastic shift towards Bob's 60/40 proposal.
* **Focus on Shared Loss:** The message continues to emphasize the negative impact of inflation on both parties.  This framing aims to nudge Bob towards agreement.
* **Time Pressure:**  By Round 3, the impact of inflation is becoming more significant. Alice's offer, while a concession, still secures her a larger share while time is still on her side."
