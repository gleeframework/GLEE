Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor. This is a good starting point, considering the inflation risk and the fact that I'm making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Due to inflation, my share is worth less, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, is a decent split considering the circumstances.  There's a risk that if I reject, the next round could be even worse for me."
