**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress. While the deal isn't amazing, her offers are getting better for me. I'll hold out for a slightly better split, knowing time is on my side."

# Alice's message: I'd rather take a smaller share than give in to your demands! 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** It's getting risky now. While I'd prefer a better split, Alice is showing she's willing to take a bad deal out of spite. If I push further, she might accept getting $0 just to make me lose too. It's better to take the sure win now, even if it's not ideal."
