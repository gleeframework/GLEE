"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very unfair offer!  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That's a tough start, Alice! How about a more reasonable split? 60/40 seems fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try 80/20. It's better for both of us than the last round, and still leaves room for more discussion. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While 80/20 is better than her initial offer, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. I need to see some significant movement towards a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's find some middle ground. I'm proposing 55/45 - it's a smaller gap from my last offer and recognizes that time is running out for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to drop to 70/30. This is the last offer I'll make before the inflation hurts us both too much. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting frustrating, Alice.  While 70/30 is her best offer yet, it's still not acceptable.  The inflation is starting to become a real concern, but I'm willing to risk it for a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. 50/50. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money here. Let's be reasonable and split it 60/40. It's better than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is incredibly frustrating, as Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. However, with the rate of inflation, waiting any longer will only hurt me more. Accepting 60/40 ensures I at least get something out of this negotiation."
