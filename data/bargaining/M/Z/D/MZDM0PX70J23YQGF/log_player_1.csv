"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as a good starting point. Let's see if we can work towards a solution. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to flip the script and get the larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! I'm not willing to give up 60% of the pot so easily. I'd like to counter with a 55/45 split in my favor.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-proposal with a 55-45 split in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money has decreased in value again due to inflation. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 55/45 is a fair split. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm sticking with my 55-45 split, but giving Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach a compromise."
