Let's see if Bob takes this deal!  I'm starting with a slight advantage, but I'm willing to negotiate.  ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob is offering me a nearly identical deal to what I proposed.  I'll take it! There's no need to risk losing money with inflation."
