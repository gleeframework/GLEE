"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll take the smaller share this time.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the bigger share this time.  Let's split it 60-40. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

I'll reject Bob's offer. His proposal is the same as mine in the first round, but with the same split. I'm not willing to accept the same offer that I already rejected. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less this time, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
