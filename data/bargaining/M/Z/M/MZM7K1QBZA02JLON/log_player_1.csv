"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering you 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining 80%. This way, we can both have a chance to negotiate and make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation that will affect your share in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'd rather not accept a 40% gain for myself, as it will be worth even less in the next round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain will be worth 40% less than in round 1. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, this way we both get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game."
