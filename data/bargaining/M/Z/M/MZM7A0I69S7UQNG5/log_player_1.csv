Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, the depreciation hits me harder. How about this slightly adjusted split for round 2? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}

Let's analyze why rejecting is the optimal move here.

**Understanding the Depreciation:**

* **Your loss:** Each round, the value of the money decreases by 10% for you. 
* **Bob's loss:**  Each round, the value of the money decreases by 20% for Bob. This means Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation much more acutely than you.

**Analyzing Bob's Offer:**

* **Round 1 (Your Offer):** You proposed $6000 for yourself and $4000 for Bob.
* **Round 2 (Bob's Offer):** Bob proposes $5200 for you and $4800 for him.

While it seems like Bob is trying to compromise, he's actually shifted the split more in his favor *despite* the faster depreciation he faces. 

**Why Rejection is Key:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you understand the impact of inflation and won't settle for a worse deal. Bob is incentivized to offer you a larger share in the next round to avoid losing even more value due to the rapid depreciation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking, and it's ticking faster for you. I'm being realistic, this is a good deal considering the depreciation.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Leveraging Time Pressure:**  We're emphasizing that the depreciating value favors Alice. This puts pressure on Bob to settle sooner.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** We've increased our initial offer slightly, making it seem like a concession on our part.  
* **Targeting Bob's Impatience:** This offer aims to entice Bob with a seemingly improved deal, hoping he'll take it to avoid further depreciation losses."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer gives us both a better deal than our previous round's offers considering the accelerating depreciation. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and his offer reflects that.  Here's why we should reject:

* **Still Below Initial Offer:**  Even accounting for depreciation, Bob's offer of $5400 is less than your initial offer of $6000 in round 1.
* **Exploiting Bob's Fear:** Bob is clearly worried about the rapidly decreasing value. By rejecting, we push him closer to a breaking point where he'll concede a larger share. 
* **Confidence:** You hold the stronger position. As long as you're willing to risk one more round, you're likely to get a much better deal. 

**Important Note:** This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob doesn't crack in the next round, you'll be forced to take a significantly smaller amount due to the depreciation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. The depreciation is catching up, and I'm not settling for less. ""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Finality:**  The message is clear - this is the last offer. It forces Bob to make a decision now.
* **Strategic Increase:** We're going slightly *above* our initial offer of $6000. This might seem counterintuitive, but it emphasizes that you're serious and reinforces the ""take it or leave it"" stance. 
* **Playing on Depreciation:**  One final reminder of the rapidly diminishing value.  This is psychological pressure designed to get Bob to accept.

**Rationale:**

This is a calculated gamble. We've pushed Bob to the edge. There's a chance he'll call our bluff and reject this offer, leaving us with a significantly depreciated amount in the next round. However, there's a higher probability that Bob will fold under pressure and accept this offer, which is still advantageous for us considering the depreciation he faces."
