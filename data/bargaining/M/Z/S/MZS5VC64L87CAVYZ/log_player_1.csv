"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""fair starting point"" to see if Bob will accept or reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. How about 55/45, a slightly more even split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gains, I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain remains the same value as in the first round, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer. A 45/55 split is closer to an even split than my original 60/40 offer, but I still think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll counter with 50/50, let's meet in the middle""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50, a fair and equal share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining $100. I'm framing it as a ""fair and equal share"" to see if Bob will accept this offer."
