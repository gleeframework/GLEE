"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm trying to be generous, but I'm also trying to get a good starting point for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer this time 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $7,000 is worth 20% less than the $8,000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to $6,400. Bob's gain of $3,000 is worth 10% less than the $2,000 he could have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to $1,800.

Considering this, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of $6,400 from the previous round is now worth 20% less, which is equivalent to $5,120. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a deal, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a fair share, meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,120 from the previous round is now worth 48.8% less, which is equivalent to $2,665.60. Bob's gain of $4,000 from the previous round is now worth 27.1% less, which is equivalent to $2,914.80.

Considering this, Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him is actually a better deal than what I would have gotten in terms of purchasing power. I'll accept this offer.
