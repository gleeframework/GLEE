I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it. Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and with the inflation, it's a better deal than my initial offer. Let's end this game!"
