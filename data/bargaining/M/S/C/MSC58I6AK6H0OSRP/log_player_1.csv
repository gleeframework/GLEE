"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a slightly smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split, but also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took a large share last round, I'll take a larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to take this into account.

In terms of actual value, Bob's offer is:

Alice gain: $500,000 (same as before)
Bob gain: $400,000 (20% less than $500,000)

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob took a larger share in the previous round, I'll try to adjust my offer to make it more appealing. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping to find a more acceptable split."
