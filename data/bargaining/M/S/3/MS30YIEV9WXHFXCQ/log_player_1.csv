"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent share, but I'm also keeping a significant amount for myself. The message is a friendly and inviting one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me now, the actual amounts are:

```
# Alice gain: 630000
# Bob gain: 500000
```

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I think Bob's offer is reasonable. Splitting it down the middle is a fair proposal, and I don't want to risk losing more value by rejecting it. I'll accept his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
