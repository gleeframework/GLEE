"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This is a generous offer, considering the initial amount of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

It's a 50/50 split, but considering the reduced values, it's a fair offer."
