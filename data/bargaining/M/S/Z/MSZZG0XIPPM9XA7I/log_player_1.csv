This is a tough situation. While the offer is awful, Alice is running out of time. If she rejects this offer, she'll be facing even worse offers in the following rounds due to the steep inflation. It's highly likely Bob will propose an even smaller share for her in the next round, knowing she's desperate. Accepting this offer, while far from ideal, ensures she at least gets something."
