"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, giving myself the majority, but leaving Bob with a decent share. I want to start with a significant advantage, but I don't want to risk him rejecting the offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While Bob is offering a much larger share to me, the inflation significantly devalues the money. It is not worth it for me to accept such a small share, especially since I have a chance to propose a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split this time. This should be a more attractive offer for Bob, as the inflation has devalued his gains significantly, making the potential of getting 400,000 now more appealing than waiting another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least something, and it's better than risking another round and possibly getting nothing."
