"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a smaller share to get the money sooner.  I'm hoping to minimize the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my original offer after accounting for inflation. I'll reject this and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I still believe this is a fair split considering the inflation that has occurred."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, after accounting for inflation it's the best possible outcome for me.  I'm accepting this offer to avoid further risk of losing money to inflation."
