Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to take a very greedy approach in the first round, aiming to get the vast majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I still think I can get a better deal, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting.  Inflation is hitting Bob harder than me, so the offer will only get worse for him in future rounds.  I'll take the 500,000 and move on."
