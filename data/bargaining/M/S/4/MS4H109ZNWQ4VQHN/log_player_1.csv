"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem generous, but remember, the value of money decreases with each round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While the money is worth less with each round, it's better to secure a larger portion now than risk getting nothing later. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
