"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. I believe this is a fair offer, as I am taking a larger share due to the greater inflation rate against my money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 600,000 to 400,000 split.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation rate is heavily impacting my gains, and this is a better outcome than potentially getting a lower offer or a worse split in the next round."
