"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the drastic change in the proposal, but I'll consider it.

Since Bob's offer is a significant departure from my initial proposal, I'll think carefully about it.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I get only 10% of the total amount. I think we can do better than that. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""You can't have it all, Bob! Let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the effects of inflation are starting to bite!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to think carefully about it. While it's still a significant departure from my initial proposal, I'm willing to consider it.

I'm not thrilled about getting only 45% of the total amount, but I'm also aware that the money is worth less than it was initially. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that we can finalize the deal and avoid further rounds."
