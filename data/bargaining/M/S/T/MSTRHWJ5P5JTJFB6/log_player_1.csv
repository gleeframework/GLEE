"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a 70-30 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
