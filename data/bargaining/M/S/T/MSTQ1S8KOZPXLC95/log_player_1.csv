"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting off with a slightly unfair proposal, giving myself 90% and Bob 10%.  This is to test the waters and see how much Bob is willing to accept.  Since the money is worth less to him than me with each round, I expect him to be more eager to agree to something even if it's not completely fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is the opposite of mine, and while it's not great, it's still a significant gain for me. However, I believe I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth less to me with each passing round, I'm willing to wait and see if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I believe that with the inflation factor working against Bob, he'll be more likely to accept something closer to a 75/25 split than the 90/10 I proposed in round 1."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is better than the 10/90 split from Round 2, and with the significant inflation working against him, it's likely he won't offer anything closer to a 50/50 split.  While I'd prefer a more even division, accepting this offer ensures I gain something, which is better than risking getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
