"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, I'll get the majority, but I'll be fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, where I get 75% and Bob gets 25%. I'm framing it as a generous offer, but in reality, I'm trying to get the majority of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
