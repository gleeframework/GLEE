I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  I'm confident that even with the 5% inflation, I'll still get a good portion of the money. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being greedy! I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially since I'm losing money due to inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my share, but still offering Bob a decent amount. I'm hoping he'll see that it's better to split the money now rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky. I'm losing more and more due to inflation, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll take the 450,000 and cut my losses."
