"Round 1

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess as we go.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you can have a small share for now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty lopsided offer!

I'll reject it. I'm not willing to give up 7,000 to Bob just yet.

```

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's still a pretty uneven split!

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty aggressive offer!

I'll reject it. I'm not going to let Bob take 9,000 and leave me with a tiny 1,000. That's not a fair or reasonable split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting any more, this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an ultimatum!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

}
```

I'm making a strong move, proposing a 9,000 to 1,000 split. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than this, and I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me anymore!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not taking the majority, I'm taking almost all of it. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 9990 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an extremely lopsided offer!

I'll reject it. I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with a paltry 10 dollars. That's not even worth my time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again!"

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking it all, you're getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a take-it-or-leave-it offer!

I'll reject it. I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with nothing. I'd rather go home with nothing than let Bob take all the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It looks like we've reached the end of the 12 rounds. Since we didn't reach a mutually acceptable agreement, I suppose we'll have to split the money 50/50, as per the original rules."
