"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive proposal, but I figure I have the advantage of being the first proposer, and Bob's money is depreciating much faster than mine.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original proposal. While the money is depreciating, it's still not depreciating fast enough to justify accepting a 40/60 split. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to propose a 85/15 split this time. It's still a pretty good deal for me, considering the inflation, and I think it's more reasonable than my first offer.  Let's see if Bob is more inclined to accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse! While his money is depreciating significantly, my money is still worth more than his offer. I will reject this offer and continue to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm sticking with a higher offer for myself, but I'm lowering it a little bit to 80/20.  I'm hoping that with the increasing inflation, Bob will start to see that he's getting a better deal than he would if we continue playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting ridiculous! Even with the huge depreciation on his side, I'm not going to accept a measly 5% of the money. I'll keep rejecting these low offers and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 75/25. Bob's money is depreciating rapidly, and I think he's starting to realize that he's losing out by rejecting my offers. I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy! Even with the extreme depreciation on his side, I'm not going to accept just 1% of the money. I'm going to keep rejecting these unfair offers and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 70/30. Bob's money is losing a lot of value with each round, and I'm hoping this will be enough for him to accept.  We're running out of time, and I need to secure some of this money before it's worth nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable! While I understand his money is depreciating faster than mine, 2% is not enough for me to accept.  I'm going to reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.  The game is getting very close, and I need to be strategic with my rejections."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

This is a big risk, but it's my last chance to get a decent deal. I'm lowering my offer to 65/35, hoping that the pressure of the clock and the depreciation will finally get Bob to accept.  I'm worried about the inflation, but if he rejects this, there's no chance of getting anything at all in the last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a terrible offer, but it's my last chance. Bob's money is worth almost nothing, and the inflation is making my money worth less too. Accepting this offer is better than getting nothing at all, even if it's a tiny amount. It's a lesson learned about the importance of starting with a more moderate offer!"
