Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to split fairly, but considering the inflation, I need to take a bit more to make it worthwhile for both of us. This ensures we both benefit from reaching an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250
