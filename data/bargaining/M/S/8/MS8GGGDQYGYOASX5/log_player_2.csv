"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, but the inflation heavily favors her in this scenario. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split, Alice. Consider the inflation impact.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing Bob, let's settle this quickly. This offer is still fair to you. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to pressure me with the decreasing value, but her offer is getting worse. I need to hold firm and aim for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice. This offer is a compromise considering the inflation disadvantage I have.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing out with every round. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to make a rational decision. Alice is clearly playing hardball, and her offer is barely above the midpoint now. 

While I'd prefer a more favorable split, the inflation is eating away at the value significantly with each passing round.  Accepting this offer ensures I at least get something, rather than risking getting nothing at all if we reach round 12."
