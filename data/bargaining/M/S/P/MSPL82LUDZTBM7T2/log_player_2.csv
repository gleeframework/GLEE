Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want more, Bob, but I'm not willing to take less than 55%. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{

""alice_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This offer is a compromise.  I'm taking a smaller gain for the sake of agreement.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer.  If you reject, we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob is losing value with every round that passes. Waiting any longer will result in an even worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Rejecting it likely means both parties get nothing. 
* **Current Offer vs. Future Uncertainty:**  While not ideal, getting $40 (even with inflation) is better than risking a complete loss by hoping for a better offer in the remaining rounds."
