"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I'm starting with a fairly uneven split. This should encourage Bob to accept, as even a small amount is better than nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better than getting nothing in the later rounds, but it's still unfair. I'll reject and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm offering a slightly more even split this time. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that the value of the money is decreasing and might be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to being fair, but it's still not enough. I'm going to keep rejecting until we get to a split that's more equitable. The value of the money is dropping quickly, so I need to be patient."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but still maintaining a slight advantage.  The money is losing value rapidly, so I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a fair share and encouraging Bob to accept before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's time to accept and split the remaining money evenly."
