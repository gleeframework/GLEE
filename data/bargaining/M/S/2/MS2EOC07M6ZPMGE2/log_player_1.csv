"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take $6,000 and you take $4,000. It's a good starting point!""
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took $6,000 last round, I'll take a bit more this time. Still a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the offer is not as good as it seems.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the decrease in value, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money and gives Bob a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the middle, but I think I can do better than that. Meet me at $6000! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value.

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer of $4000 for me and $6000 for him seems reasonable. It's not a bad compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower-valued money.

I'll accept this offer.
