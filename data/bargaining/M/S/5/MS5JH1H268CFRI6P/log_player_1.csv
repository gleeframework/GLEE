"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and divide it almost equally""}\n\n###\n\nThis is the first round, and I'm trying to be generous while also getting a bit more than half of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Let's speed things up. This is my offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I think 40 is too low, especially considering the inflation. I'm willing to take a risk and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob! Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair offer considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to be a bit more aggressive with my offer this time, while still being reasonable. I'm taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was quite low in the previous round. I'm hoping he'll see this as a good compromise and accept it. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm meeting you halfway - take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nBob thinks he's meeting me halfway, but considering the inflation, his offer is actually worse than it seems. I'm not willing to accept 45, which is worth almost 50% less than the original amount. I'll take a risk and make another counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal. The game is heating up!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Fine, let's split it down the middle. But consider the inflation, Bob! This is a better deal for you than it seems""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by offering a 50-50 split. However, I'm also pointing out that due to the inflation, this deal is actually more favorable to him than it appears. I'm hoping he'll see the reason in my offer and accept it, rather than risking further devaluation of the money. Let's see if Bob will take the bait!"
