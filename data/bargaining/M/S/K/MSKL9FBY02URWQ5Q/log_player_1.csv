"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will try to do better in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less than the original $800,000, so I would get $640,000. Bob's gain is worth 5% less than the original $200,000, so he would get $190,000.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a good one, and I think it's reasonable to accept. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
