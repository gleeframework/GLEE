"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, let's get this game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Bob's offer is not a 50/50 split, I'll have to consider the trade-off. With the inflation factor, my gain is worth 20% less, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less as well. Considering this, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again!

Considering the inflation rate, my offer for Round 3 is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm offering a slightly weighted split in my favor, but still a relatively fair share for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reassess Bob's offer. Since the inflation rate is higher for me, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk losing out on more money due to inflation.
