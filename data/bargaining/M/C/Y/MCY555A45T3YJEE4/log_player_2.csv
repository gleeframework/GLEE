# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50. It's a fair and balanced proposal 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains.  A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
