"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering I'm the one taking the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think it's fair that Bob gets a bigger share just because he's taking the risk of inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to give him a bigger share without getting something in return.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.
