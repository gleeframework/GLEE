"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer where I'll receive $55 and Bob will receive $45. I also added a message suggesting that this division is somewhat fair but slightly in my favor. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more even split this time.  I think this is fairer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm Alice, I'll consider Bob's offer. Given that the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, Bob's offer of $45 for me is actually worth $40.50 in real value. Meanwhile, Bob gets to keep the full value of his $55. Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer in hopes of getting a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still trying to maximize my gain. I'll offer $52 for myself and $48 for Bob. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to two rounds of inflation, my $52 is actually worth $41.60 in real value. I'll add a message to try to convince Bob that this is a fair deal.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
