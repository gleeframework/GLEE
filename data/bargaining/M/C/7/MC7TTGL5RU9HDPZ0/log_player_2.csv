Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  I propose a more balanced 55/45 split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 55/45 split still feels too one-sided.  Let's try 57.5/42.5.  It's closer to what I initially offered. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's important to remember that time is on my side due to the difference in inflation rates. Each round that passes gives me a stronger negotiating position.  I need to push for a better deal while being mindful not to push Alice too far."
