"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 99 dollars for myself and giving Bob 1 dollar. This is a very advantageous offer for me, as it takes advantage of the inflation that hurts Bob more than it hurts me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
