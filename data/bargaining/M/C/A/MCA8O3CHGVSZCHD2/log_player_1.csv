I'm going to offer Bob a small portion (100,000$) to see if he'll take it. I'm hoping to get most of the money, but I'm also aware of the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
