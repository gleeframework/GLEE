700000.0,300000.0,"Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I believe a 70/30 split is a fair starting point considering the inflation disadvantage I have.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, your starting offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split. This recognizes your lack of inflation, but also acknowledges the limited rounds we have.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I appreciate the movement towards a more balanced deal. However, 60/40 still doesn't reflect the urgency of the situation for me. I'm proposing 65/35 -  it's a fair compromise that lets us both walk away with something substantial.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
575000.0,425000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and these negotiations are going nowhere fast.  I'm offering you 57.5% - it's a strong offer considering the inflation working against me. Let's close this deal and avoid walking away with nothing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
620000.0,380000.0,"Bob, I understand the time pressure, but I need a fair deal. Your offer doesn't account for the significant impact inflation has on your gains. I'm proposing 62/38.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you 55%, a significant portion, despite the fact that I'm the one battling inflation. Take this deal, or we both risk ending up with nothing! This isn't a negotiation; it's an ultimatum.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm sensing your frustration, and I want to find a solution.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering 60/40. It's a compromise, and it ensures we both leave with a substantial amount.  Time is running out, let's be smart about this.",Alice,7,
