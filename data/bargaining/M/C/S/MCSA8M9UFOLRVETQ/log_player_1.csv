Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty lopsided offer. I'll take 90% and leave 10% for Bob.  I want to see if he'll accept it right away, or if he'll try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, taking 50% is much better than the 5% I'd get if I reject and then Bob proposes the same thing again. With inflation, it's important to secure a decent amount now."
