"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""The value decreases quickly, Bob. Let's settle this now with a reasonable offer.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meeting in the middle, considering the decreasing value for me. Hopefully, this is fair for both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further devaluation of Bob's potential offers. The longer the game goes, the less incentive Bob has to offer me anything substantial."
