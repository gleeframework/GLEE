"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more equitable split this time, Alice.  Let's make a deal!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This offer is still heavily in your favor considering the devaluation. Let's be practical and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob.  While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially after factoring in the devaluation. Bob can afford to be a little more patient and see if he can secure a more favorable deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's wrap this up. This offer gives you a fair share considering the time pressure and the impact inflation is having on your side.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this back and forth isn't helping either of us.  This is a strong offer considering the time pressure and how inflation is disproportionately affecting me.  Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tables are starting to turn. While not ideal, Alice's offer is now reasonably fair, especially considering the rapid devaluation she's experiencing.  

Holding out further risks Alice offering even less favorable terms, or even worse, time running out and both players getting nothing.  It's time for Bob to take the win and secure a good amount, even if it means Alice gets slightly more."
