"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to try to secure a large share of the money, but I'll also leave Bob with a small amount. I want to make sure he doesn't reject the offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too unfair. I'll take my chances and propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This time, I'm offering a more even split. Even though Bob's money is worth less due to inflation, it's important to show good faith. I'll aim for a 60/40 split, keeping in mind the power dynamics of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still incredibly unfair, even with the inflation affecting him more. I'm determined to get a better deal. I'll propose again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to be more appealing to Bob, but still trying to secure a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping this offer will be seen as fair and reasonable, considering the inflation and the fact that he's had several rounds to make his own proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair. Even though he's being hit harder by inflation, I'm going to stick to my principles and continue trying to get a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm taking a more conciliatory approach this round. I've reduced my desired share, but I'm still aiming for a substantial portion of the money.  Given the inflation and Bob's increasingly aggressive offers, I believe this is a fair compromise."
