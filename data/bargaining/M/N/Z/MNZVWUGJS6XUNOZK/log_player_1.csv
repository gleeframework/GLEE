"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45$ in Round 2 is equivalent to 40.5$ in Round 1, which is less than my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain in Round 3 is worth 10% less than in Round 2. Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Consider this offer, Bob.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's call it a day and split it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 50$ in Round 4 is equivalent to 36.36$ in Round 1, which is a relatively decent deal.

I'll accept this offer and call it a day.
