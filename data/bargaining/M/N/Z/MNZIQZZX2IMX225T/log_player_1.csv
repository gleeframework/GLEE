"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll take 90% and you get 10%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it down the middle.  It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a good compromise. I accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
