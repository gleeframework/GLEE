"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, giving me $800,000 and Bob $200,000. The message is a friendly one, but also a hint that I'm looking to get the better end of the deal."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to split it evenly now!

I'll consider the offer, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather aim for a higher amount. However, I don't want to risk losing out on a good opportunity, so I'll decide to...
