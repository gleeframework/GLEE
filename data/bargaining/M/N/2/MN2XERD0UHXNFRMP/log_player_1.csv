"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. The message I sent is ""Let's divide fairly"".\n\n###\n\nNow it's Bob's turn. Please respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\n###\n\nNote: Please keep in mind that the game has just started, and the money's value will decrease with each passing round. I made a relatively generous offer to Bob in the hope that he will accept it and we can end the game early, minimizing the loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly, given the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds. The fact that the money is worth 20% less for me and only 10% less for Bob means that I have more to lose from inflation than Bob does. However, I'm not ready to settle for an even split, given that I started with a more generous offer in the first round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $450,000 and I'll take $550,000. The message I sent is ""Meet me in the middle"".\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I've reduced my initial offer, but still not to the point of an even split. I'm trying to find a compromise that Bob will accept, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n###\n\nNow it's Bob's turn again. Please respond with Bob's decision."
