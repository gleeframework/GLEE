Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's important to consider Bob's perspective as well. I think this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep a larger share, the offer is now more favorable to Bob.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
