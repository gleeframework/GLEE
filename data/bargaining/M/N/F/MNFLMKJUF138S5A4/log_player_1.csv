"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept it quickly before the inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is worse than my initial proposal, it's still a significant gain, and with the inflation factor, my share will be much smaller if I reject and continue to the next round."
