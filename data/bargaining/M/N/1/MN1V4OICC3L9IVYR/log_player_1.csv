Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

# Bob gain: 60

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled with the 60-40 split, but considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less than it was initially, I think this is a decent offer. I'll accept this proposal to avoid further negotiations and try to get as much as I can."
