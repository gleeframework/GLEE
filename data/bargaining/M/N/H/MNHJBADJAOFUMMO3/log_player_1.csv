I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will take it. I want to minimize the number of rounds so we both get the most out of our money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, and the money is worth less now due to inflation.  I'll take my chances with a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I think it's still fair considering the inflation and Bob's previous rejection.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing than Bob's offer and we can avoid going into round 4."
