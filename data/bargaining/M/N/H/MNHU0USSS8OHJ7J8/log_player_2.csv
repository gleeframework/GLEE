Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 7500 
# Alice gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Alice's offer. Since the money is worth less for me, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. However, I don't want to be too greedy, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept Alice's offer from round 3.
