"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but I want to see how Bob reacts.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more of the money, the inflation is starting to bite. This offer is better than nothing, and it's unlikely I'll get a more favorable deal in the future rounds."
