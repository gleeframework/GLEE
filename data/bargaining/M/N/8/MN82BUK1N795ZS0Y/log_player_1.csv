"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, giving me a larger share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, but I still need to consider the offer. Bob's offer is a 55-45 split, which is closer to the 60-40 split I initially proposed, but I still get a smaller share. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the ongoing inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6300,
  ""bob_gain"": 3700
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a significant change from his previous offer. Considering the drastic decrease in the value of the money, I think this offer is a good opportunity to settle for a fair share.
