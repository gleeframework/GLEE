"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, Alice. Let's make it fair and simple. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about accepting a 50/50 split, especially since my gain would be worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm feeling bold, Bob. I'll give you $3,000, but I need $7,000 for myself. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept.""

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which is a significant drop.
