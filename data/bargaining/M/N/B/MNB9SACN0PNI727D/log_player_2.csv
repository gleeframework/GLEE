Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll take a shot at getting a slightly bigger share.  After all, there's always the chance Alice will find my offer more appealing than her own!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is fair and, due to inflation, my potential gains in the next round will be significantly less.  It's better to take what I can get now."
