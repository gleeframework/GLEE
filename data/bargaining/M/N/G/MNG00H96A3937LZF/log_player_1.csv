  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a good chunk of change, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""

Round 2

# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not giving up yet! Time to make a move! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer. The offer is still too skewed towards Bob's gain, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

# Alice gain: 5500

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original, I need to be even more cautious.
