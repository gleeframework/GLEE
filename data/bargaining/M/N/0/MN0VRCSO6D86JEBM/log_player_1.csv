"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see where we go from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see what Bob has in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach. You can't expect to get 50/50, can you? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a bigger share!

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, and I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the effects of inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Since the money is now worth 90% of its original value, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're being aggressive, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, trying to find a compromise between our previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not convinced. I'll give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting the better end of this deal. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to push for a bigger share!

Considering the effects of inflation, I'll evaluate his new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the effects of inflation, the money is worth 25.71% less than in the first round. I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not getting taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36/64 split, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
