Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer of an even split, Alice, but let's be practical. How about we adjust the split slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value of the money over time? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
