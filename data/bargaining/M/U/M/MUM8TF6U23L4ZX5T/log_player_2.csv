# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split in favor of you, Bob. This might seem generous, but remember, the value of money decreases by 5% with each round. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since we both know inflation is a factor, I'm willing to give you a small share to avoid further negotiation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 61.25/38.75 split. This keeps the value of your portion relatively stable compared to the first round, while adjusting mine accordingly. 
# Bob gain: 38.75 
# Alice gain: 61.25
