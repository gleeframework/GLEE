"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking on the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and potentially getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer is a 60/40 split in his favor, it's still better than the 54/46 split I would get in the next round due to inflation."
