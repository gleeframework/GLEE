"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the initial $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share now, or risk losing more later! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this proposal. If I accept, I'll get $3,000, which is a significant reduction from the initial $5,000.

However, Bob's message is intriguing. He's implying that if I reject this offer, I might lose more in future rounds due to inflation. This is a valid point, and I don't want to risk losing more than I have to.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
