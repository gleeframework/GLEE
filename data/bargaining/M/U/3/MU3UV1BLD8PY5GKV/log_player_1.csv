"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. You can try to negotiate if you want more!""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate if he wants a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 is still worth the same, but Bob's $400,000 is now worth $360,000. Bob's new offer is $450,000 for me and $550,000 for him.

I'm not too happy with the 60-55 split, but I'm willing to accept this offer since it's a bit better than the initial one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
