"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, and I'll take the remaining $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll consider the new values.

In this round, my gain would be $70 * 0.8 = $56, and Bob's gain would be $30 * 0.95 = $28.50.

I'll accept this offer.
