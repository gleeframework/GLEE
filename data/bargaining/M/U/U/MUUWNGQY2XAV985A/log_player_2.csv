"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70/30. I think it's fair considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try a 60/40 split.  This gives us both a good share, and there's still room for negotiation if we need to.""}
