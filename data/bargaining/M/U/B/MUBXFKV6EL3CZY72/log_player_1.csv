"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 90% of the money now and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent amount of money to try to negotiate a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split of the money. Each of us gets $500000. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. An equal split is a fair offer, but I can do better. I'll reject the offer and try to get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, but I'm still taking the majority of the money. Don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in favor of Alice, considering the inflation effects. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, the money is worth even less. A 60-40 split is a more reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think carefully...

After considering the offer, I decide to accept it. The inflation is making the money less valuable, and I don't want to risk going to round 5.
