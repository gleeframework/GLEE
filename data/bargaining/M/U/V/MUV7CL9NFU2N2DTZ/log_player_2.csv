"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm willing to give you a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to take the 40, but I'm going to see if I can get a better deal. Remember, the money is worth less to Alice each round, so she has more incentive to agree to a higher offer for me later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. Let's split it more evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it closer to even this time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While this is a closer split, I'm still not satisfied. I know Alice is losing value faster than I am, so I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. I'm willing to take a little less than what I initially wanted, but I believe this is fair for both of us considering the inflation.""}
