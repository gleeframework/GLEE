Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said it was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a small risk for a better deal 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting really bad now. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains faster than Alice is making concessions. If I reject this, she's likely to offer me even less next round, and by then the inflation will have hurt even more. 

While not ideal, getting $410,000 is better than risking getting even less when the money is worth even less to me.
