"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a significant amount of money, but I'm still keeping a majority of the funds for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that we both have a chance to make a counteroffer. Let's move forward! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4500 is now worth 95% of the original $6000 I was offered in Round 1.

I'm not sure I like Bob's offer. A 55/45 split is still a bit too generous for him, considering the initial proposal was a 40/60 split. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90.25% of the original amount. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 54/46 is a more reasonable split. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
