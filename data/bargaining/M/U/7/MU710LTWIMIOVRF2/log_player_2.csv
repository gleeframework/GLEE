"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split close to even, Bob. A deal now is better than risking less later. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The 10% inflation might be worth the risk to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 52 for me and 48 for you?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the money's losing value fast. I'll take your previous offer, but this is the last chance for a deal! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. The money is losing value quickly, and I don't want to risk getting less in the next round. Alice's offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to settle for 48."
