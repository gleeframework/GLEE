**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, time is running out, not for me.  Alice is steadily decreasing her share, indicating a willingness to negotiate. I'm betting she'll crack under pressure soon."

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing the deal. While not ideal, this is better than getting nothing in a few more rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take the offer."
