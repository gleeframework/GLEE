"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair and equal start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. However, a 50/50 split is a very reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
