"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not sure how the inflation affects Alice, so I want to see if I can push for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and I think it's the best chance to get the deal done before the inflation kicks in."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject the offer.  I know Alice's offer is worth less to her due to inflation, but I want to see if I can get a more even split.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly higher split in my favor this round. I know Alice's offer is worth less due to inflation, and I want to show that I'm willing to compromise. I think this might be a good compromise to get the deal done before the inflation really starts to bite."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4816 
# Alice gain: 5184 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While it's not quite a 50/50 split, Alice's offer is decreasing in value due to inflation and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I'm happy to take this deal and secure some of the money."
