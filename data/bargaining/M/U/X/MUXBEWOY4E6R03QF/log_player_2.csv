Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is tempting, time is working against me more than Alice. It's strategically better to hold out a little longer and hope she offers a better deal in the next round.  The longer this goes on, the more valuable even a small increase to my share becomes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair split. Let's end this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is the most likely to be accepted by Alice at this stage. It's better to secure a guaranteed win now than risk losing everything by being too greedy."
