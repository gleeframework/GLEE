I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer for the first round, but I believe it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I am willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

I'm going to try a 40/60 split in Bob's favor. This is a significant concession, but I believe it is the best way to ensure that we both get something. The inflation is starting to seriously impact the potential gains, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
