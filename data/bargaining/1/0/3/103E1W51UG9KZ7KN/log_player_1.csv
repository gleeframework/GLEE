I'm still going to reject this offer. Even with the inflation hitting my share harder, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The game is getting more tense, but I believe there's a chance to get a better share in the coming rounds."

While the inflation is hurting, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  It's getting close to the end, and I need to make a decision that balances the risk of getting nothing with the desire for a decent share.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to compromise further."

This round, I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation is starting to become a serious threat, and I need to find a compromise to avoid getting nothing at all.  This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's the best way to secure a deal at this point."
