"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good starting point""}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60, I'll give you 30 and keep 70. Fair enough? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think about it.

I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
