Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we've been at this for a while now.  Let's just split it evenly. I'm not getting any more money, and you're getting the same either way. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is correct. The value of his potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round due to inflation, while mine remains constant.  He's unlikely to offer more favorable terms, and waiting any longer only risks him offering even less. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees me a reasonable amount."
