"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can still afford to be a bit more generous.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 2:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
