Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than 35%.  I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer my 65/35 split, Alice is right, waiting any longer will only hurt her gains more, making it harder to strike a deal. It's better to accept a slightly less favorable offer now than risk getting even less later as her position weakens due to the inflation.
