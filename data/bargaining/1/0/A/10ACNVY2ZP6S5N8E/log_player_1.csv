Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, considering the 5% inflation that just kicked in. This way, we both still get a decent amount, but I get a bit more to offset the loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
