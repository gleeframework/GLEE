"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives me a slight edge. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Besides, with inflation looming, I'm not too keen on accepting an offer that gives Alice a significant edge right off the bat. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, considering the 5% inflation that just kicked in. This way, we both still get a decent amount, but I get a bit more to offset the loss in value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more delays and the inflation will just hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation that's been chipping away at the value of the money, and the fact that we're already in Round 3, I think it's wise to accept Alice's offer of an even split. Any further delays might just lead to us both losing out on more value, so it's best to cut our losses and settle for a 50-50 split."
