"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and take 600k for myself. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more for my negotiating skills. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'm now considering a lower amount. However, I still think I deserve a decent share. I'm not convinced that Bob's negotiating skills are worth an extra 400k.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob! I'll give you 450k, but I think I deserve a bit more for my patience. What's your next move?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 450k, but I think I can do better than that. You're getting closer to my price, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to drive a hard bargain! However, I'm not convinced that his offer is significantly better than mine from the previous round. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than 450k.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 625000,
  ""bob_gain"": 375000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit tired of your games, Bob. I'll give you 375k, but I think I deserve a bigger share now. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle. 500k for both of us. It's a fair deal, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise! Meeting in the middle at 500k for both of us seems like a reasonable proposal, considering the reduced value of the money. I'm not sure if I can do better, and it's getting late in the game.

I'll accept this offer.
