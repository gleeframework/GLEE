"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This might seem fair considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. Inflation is a factor, but I think this is a fair starting point for a more even division. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
