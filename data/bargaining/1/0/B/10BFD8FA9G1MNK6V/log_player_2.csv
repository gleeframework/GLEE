"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split 60/40. A fair deal to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45. You're losing value each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is dropping fast, let's settle this. 58/42. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice is losing value each round, her offer of 58/42 is still not as favorable to me as I would like. Given that the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have no incentive to rush into an agreement that doesn't meet my expectations. I'll wait for the next round to see if Alice becomes more desperate due to the devaluing of her potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""You're losing a lot of value, 58/42 is more reasonable now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous.  It's 50/50 or I walk. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering Alice's message and the fact that she's losing significant value each round, I believe she might actually walk away if I reject this offer. Since the 50/50 split is more favorable to me than her initial offer, and I'm not losing any value due to inflation, I'll accept this proposal to secure the $5,000."
