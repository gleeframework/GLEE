"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering future losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll take the risk of losing some value to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to divide the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm taking a bit more, still a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is hitting me hard. This offer is still a decent gain considering the losses."
