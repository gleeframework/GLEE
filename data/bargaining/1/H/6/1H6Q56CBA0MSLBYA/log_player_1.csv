"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'll have to decide whether I want to take the higher absolute amount of money now, or wait for the next round when the money will be worth even less.

For now, I'll decide to reject the offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving Bob with a significant share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

Now, considering the inflation effect, I notice that Bob's offer is actually more favorable to him than my previous offer, but the absolute amounts are not that different. However, since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the fact that Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll try to adjust my proposal to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive split in my favor, considering the decreasing value of money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a comeback. With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's share worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the decreasing value of Bob's share, I'll decide to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
