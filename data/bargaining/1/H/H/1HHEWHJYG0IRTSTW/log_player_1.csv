"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm proposing to keep almost all the money and give Bob just $1. Since the money is worth 20% less to me with each round, I want to secure as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round, accepting a 50/50 split is the best outcome for me."
