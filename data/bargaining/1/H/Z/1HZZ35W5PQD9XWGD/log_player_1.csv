"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me, I want more.""
}
```

It's my turn to make a new offer in Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good deal, but I need more for myself.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'm not giving up that much! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze me even more!

Considering the significant inflation, my gain is worth a lot less than it was initially. I'll have to be careful not to give up too much. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too little for me, I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal!"
