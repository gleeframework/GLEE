Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point. Let's try this again. I'm willing to give you more, but let's be realistic about this inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still getting the vast majority of the money, even with her ""concession"". It's worth risking further inflation to try and get a better deal."
