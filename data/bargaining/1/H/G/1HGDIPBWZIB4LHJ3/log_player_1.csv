"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $5000 is equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle, considering I was initially offered $6000 and now I'm being offered $5000. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the value of the money has decreased by 20% again, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Can we discuss further?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not that much more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less, my gain of $4500 is equivalent to $5500 in the first round. This is a bit lower than my previous offer, and I'm not sure if I want to accept it.

I was hoping for a better deal, but I don't want to reject again and risk getting an even worse offer. I'll accept this one.
