"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us a fair share considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice each round, she may be willing to offer me a larger share to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation affecting Alice's valuation of the money. Since she loses 10% value each round, I might be able to negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fairer split. You lose less value now than if we go another round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or I'm likely to propose something less favorable to you next round due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Given that Alice's valuation of the money decreases by 10% each round and she's already lost 19% value, it's likely that she'll offer me less in the next round. Accepting this offer now ensures I get a relatively better deal compared to what I might get if the game continues.
