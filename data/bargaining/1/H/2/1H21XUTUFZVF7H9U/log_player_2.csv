I'm not sure if Alice is being reasonable, and I want to see what kind of offer I can get if I get to propose.  Let's see what happens next round!"

I'm sticking to my guns! I think I can get a better deal if I keep rejecting.  Let's see what happens next round."

While I still think I deserve more, I'm worried about inflation eating away at my potential gains.  This offer is pretty close to what I was originally hoping for, and I don't want to risk getting nothing! Let's take this deal and move on."
