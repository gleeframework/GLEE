Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle, I'm losing value here! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and rightfully so, as inflation is eating into her potential gains. While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, I believe I can push my luck a little further.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, so the pressure is on her to accept a less favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm offering a straight 50/50 split.  Take it before inflation hurts you even more.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play it safe. While I might have been able to squeeze out a bit more in previous rounds, a 50/50 split is fair and prevents me from getting greedy. With each round, the risk grows, and this offer guarantees I get a decent share."
