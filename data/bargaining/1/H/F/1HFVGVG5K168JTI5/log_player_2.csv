Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1. This means I'll take 75$, and you'll take 25$. Considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds, this might be the most beneficial offer for both of us.

# Alice gain: 75

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decrease in the value of money, I propose a split of $60 for me and $40 for you. This maintains a balance while accounting for the inflation we're facing. Let's aim for mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
