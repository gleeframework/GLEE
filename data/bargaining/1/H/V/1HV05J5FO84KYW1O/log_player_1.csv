"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for a fair negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is actually a bit more generous than it initially seems.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up 60% of the remaining money just yet. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still trying to get a bit more than in his previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slight edge this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll take Bob's offer this time. With inflation eating away at the money, I'd rather get something now than risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. Plus, I'm getting a decent share, and it's a fair compromise. Let's shake on it!"
