I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  I'm taking a big chunk, but I figure this is the best way to secure a good amount of money early on, before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $100,000, I know that if I wait, I can potentially get a much better deal. The inflation is affecting the value of the money, and I need to make sure I get a fair share.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. While I'm willing to give Bob a slightly bigger share than in Round 1, I'm still aiming for the majority. I need to secure a good portion of the money while we still have 10 rounds left, as the inflation is going to continue to erode the value."
