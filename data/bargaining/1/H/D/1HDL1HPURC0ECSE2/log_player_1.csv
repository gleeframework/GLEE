"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, which is a reasonable approach. Since I'm not getting a better offer, I'll accept this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
