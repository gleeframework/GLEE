"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a generous 40% of the original amount, considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, it's a reasonable proposal, considering the inflation factor.

I accept Bob's offer.
