Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of me in the early rounds, let's split it more fairly now""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decrease in value, I propose a split of 5200:4800. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
