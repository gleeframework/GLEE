"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a ridiculous offer. There's no way I'd accept getting only $1.  Let's see what Alice's next offer will be."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  This is a fair offer, considering the money will be worth less for her in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much better offer than the first round.  I'll take $500,000, it's a fair split and it's better than the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
