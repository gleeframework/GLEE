"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation. My gain of $2,000 is worth 95% of the original value, which is $1,900.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $2,000, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit low for me, Bob. I was hoping for a better split. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so my gain will be worth 90.5% of the original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take $3,000 and you can have the rest. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up too much. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, my gain of $4,000 is worth 59.51% of the original value, which is $5,950.60.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not thrilled about getting a relatively small share, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit low for me, Bob. I was hoping for a more generous offer. I'll reject this and wait for a better one.""

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, Bob. I'll take $4,200 and you can have the rest. This is my best offer so far. What do you say?""
