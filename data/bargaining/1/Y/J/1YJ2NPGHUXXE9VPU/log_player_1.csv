"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then we can reassess""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we reevaluate our offers after this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $4000
Bob gain: $6000

I'm not too thrilled about taking the smaller share, but I think it's a fair offer considering the initial proposal was 50-50. I'll accept this offer.
