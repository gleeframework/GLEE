I'm going to propose a split that is heavily in my favor, since I know the money is worth more to me now than it will be later. Let's see if Bob is willing to take a small share now or risk getting even less later!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not as good as my initial proposal,  I'm getting $5,000, and with inflation, that's less than the $7,200 (9000 * .8) that I would have gotten if I had accepted the first offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing."
