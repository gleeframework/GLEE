"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. You get a small share now, but we both get more in the future if we keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer seems appealing in the short term, I'm not sure it's worth the risk.  The inflation rates are significantly different, meaning my gains are much smaller than hers.  I'd rather see what kind of offer I can get in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
