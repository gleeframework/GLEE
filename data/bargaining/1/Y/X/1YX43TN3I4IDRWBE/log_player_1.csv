"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a fair split, with each of us getting half of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still have the same amount to gain, but for Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so he's offering me more than he would have offered in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
