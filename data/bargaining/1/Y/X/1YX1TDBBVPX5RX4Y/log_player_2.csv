Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this goes on, the less value the money holds, especially for you. I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and ensures we both benefit.  Don't let greed shrink your potential winnings further. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
