  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Start with a generous offer, see if Bob accepts""
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

```

Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is getting serious about splitting the money evenly. Here's my response:

```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Splitting it down the middle seems like a fair and reasonable solution. I'll take $5000 and Bob will take $5000."
