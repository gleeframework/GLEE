Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly considering the inflation impact.""}\n\nMy offer is to take $600,000 for myself and give $400,000 to Bob.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation impact, how about a split that better reflects the risks for both of us? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Considering the inflation impact, his offer doesn't seem fair to me. The money is worth less now, and I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer again. Although the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I still think I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer is closer to a fair split, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. Let's move on to the next round!"

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait, I made a mistake, I will write it correctly this time
 {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable and fair offer at this point. I'd rather accept this offer than risk losing even more value in the next rounds. Let's settle on this and end the game!"
