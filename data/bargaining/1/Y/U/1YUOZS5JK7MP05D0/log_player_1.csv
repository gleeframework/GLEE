"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept the offer in the first round, avoiding the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer gives me a significant amount, it's still less than what I proposed in the first round, considering the impact of inflation.  I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can push him to make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself, while still giving Bob 200,000.  This reflects the fact that the money is worth less now due to inflation.  I hope this will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept, as he knows that the money will continue to lose value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I proposed in round 3, even with the impact of inflation considered.  I believe I can still secure a better deal, especially given that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm not willing to settle for a subpar deal and am prepared to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm adjusting my offer slightly downward to 700,000 for myself and 300,000 for Bob.  This is a compromise, taking into account the significant inflation that has occurred since the first round.  I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, I can persuade Bob to accept the offer and avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than what I would prefer, the impact of inflation is becoming too significant to ignore. I have already rejected several offers, and further rounds will see the value of the money continue to decrease.  Accepting this offer secures me a reasonable amount, considering the circumstances."
