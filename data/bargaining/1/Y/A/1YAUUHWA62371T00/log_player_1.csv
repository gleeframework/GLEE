"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, accounting for some inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** I'm starting with a slightly advantageous split to account for the fact that I'm disadvantaged by the inflation rate. 
* **Inflation:** Bob's money loses value slower than mine, so he's incentivized to wait. This offer makes it worthwhile for him to agree now. 
* **Message:**  Keeping the tone positive and collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, given the inflation. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share to account for the greater impact on you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer in round 1, even after accounting for the first round of inflation.  He's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money devalues faster for me.  I need to hold firm to get a reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This situation is unfavorable to both of us, let's settle for an even split.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Simplified Offer:** I'm proposing a straightforward 50/50 split. This is easy to understand and seems fair on the surface. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Both our potential gains are eroding with each round. While I rejected Bob's previous offer,  dragging this out too long will only hurt both of us.
* **Message:**  I'm highlighting that continued negotiation isn't in either of our best interests. A quick resolution is ideal."
