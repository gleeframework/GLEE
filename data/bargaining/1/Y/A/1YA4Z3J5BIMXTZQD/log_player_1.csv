"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm trying to be fair and start with a high offer to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I'm offering you 400000, but we can always negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to flip the script and keep more for himself. My initial reaction is to reject his offer, but I'll think about it for a moment.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to accept an offer that gives me less than what I initially offered Bob. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my share of the money is now worth 5% less than in the previous round. Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better offer than last round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
