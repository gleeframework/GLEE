  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""

Round 2

# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's be more fair this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I will reject Bob's offer because I'm not willing to give up $900,000, which is now worth significantly less than $1,000,000.
