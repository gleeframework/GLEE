Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that the value of the money decreases for me over time. She's barely budging from her initial offer. While the difference between her gain and mine is shrinking, I believe I can still secure a better deal as time pressures her to make a more acceptable offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be real.  The clock is ticking, and this back and forth is pointless. I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Take it and we both walk away with something.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'fair' 50/50 split is actually unfair due to inflation, try again 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is blatantly trying to gaslight me by calling my 50/50 offer ""unfair"" due to inflation, when she's the one who has been benefiting from it all along!  I need to remain firm, but the time pressure is getting intense. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if she cracks."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. We're running out of time. This offer is a compromise, and while it's not ideal for me, it's far better than both of us walking away with nothing. Do you agree?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The time pressure is becoming too much.  Alice is clearly content to run the clock down, knowing that each round hurts me more than it does her.  While this offer isn't great, it's better than walking away with nothing, which is a very real possibility if I continue to reject her offers."
