"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to start by taking a large share (9000$) and leaving Bob with a smaller amount (1000$). I figure this will give me a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more for myself, this is a fair split considering the inflation on Bob's side. Accepting now ensures I get a decent share and the game ends."
