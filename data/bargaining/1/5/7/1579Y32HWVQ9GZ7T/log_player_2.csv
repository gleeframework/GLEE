"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money with a 7:3 ratio. This should be fair considering the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While the 7:3 ratio might seem fair initially, the 5% inflation per round means the value of my 300,000 will decrease significantly over time. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
