# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll be generous 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting something now against the risk of waiting for a better offer.

For now, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
