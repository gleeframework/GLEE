Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm making the offer this round, and time favors me more than you. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer. Even though it's only the second round, 20% inflation is a significant hit for me. I'll push for a better deal."
