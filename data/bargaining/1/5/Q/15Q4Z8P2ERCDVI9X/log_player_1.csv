"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This ensures a faster resolution and allows us to get the most out of the remaining value of the money before inflation erodes it further. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
