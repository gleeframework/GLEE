"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the $10,000 evenly between us. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4500 is now worth 4,425 (95% of 4,650). I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
