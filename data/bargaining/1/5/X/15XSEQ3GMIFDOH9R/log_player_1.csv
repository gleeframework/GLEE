"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I'd rather not accept Bob's offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'll do better than that!""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
