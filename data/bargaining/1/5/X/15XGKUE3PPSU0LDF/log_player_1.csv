"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, since the money is worth less to me in each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I understand Bob's perspective. Considering the money is worth less to him due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'd like to try for a more balanced split. How about 50-50?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 40-60, I'll aim for a slightly more balanced split this time. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try 52-48 this time!""}

I'm hoping Bob will be more receptive to a 52-48 split, considering the money is still worth less to him due to inflation."
