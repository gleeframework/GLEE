Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start. It's a fair and simple way to divide the money, and I'm hoping Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly better split for Bob than the previous round, but I'm still getting a decent share. This should show Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I also value my own share."

I still reject this offer. Even with inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, and I'm prepared to wait a few more rounds."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting increasingly unfair.  While the money is worth much less now, I'm still not willing to accept such a small share. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob than the previous round, but still maintaining a decent portion for myself.  With inflation rapidly decreasing my share's value, I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise and motivates Bob to accept."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is extremely unfair, and I'm not willing to accept it. While inflation is a significant factor, I'm still hopeful that we can reach a compromise.  I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, we can find a solution that works for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

Inflation is hitting hard now, but I'm still trying to secure a decent share. I'm offering Bob a larger portion than before, but I need something to keep myself from getting nothing. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to accept before it's too late for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  I'm not willing to accept such a small share, even with the significant inflation.  I'm prepared to risk getting nothing rather than accept such an unfair deal.  We still have a few rounds left, and I believe we can still find a better solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75}
```

Time is running out, and inflation is decimating the value of my share. I'm making a final push for a compromise, offering Bob a larger portion than before. I believe this is a fair deal considering the circumstances, and I hope he accepts before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the crushing inflation, I refuse to accept such a ridiculously low share.  While it's unfortunate that we couldn't reach a compromise, I'd rather get nothing than be exploited.  This negotiation has shown me that Bob was unwilling to be fair, and I'm not willing to be taken advantage of."
