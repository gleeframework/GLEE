Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 550000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is a good deal for both of us - it accounts for the time pressure while still letting you walk away with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still tilted in his favor, the effects of inflation are starting to significantly eat into my potential gains.  

* **Declining this offer:** If I reject this offer, the next round will see my potential gains reduced by another 10%. Even if I could secure a 50/50 split in round 5, the inflation would mean I'd receive less overall than I would by accepting Bob's current offer.

* **Time Pressure:** Bob's message emphasizes the time pressure, and he's right. Each round makes my position worse. It's unlikely he'll offer a significantly better deal in future rounds.

This situation highlights the power dynamic of asymmetric information in negotiations. Bob benefits from my time disadvantage. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable, though not ideal, payout considering the circumstances."
