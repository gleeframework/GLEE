"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to get the game going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's be equal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about being equal, but I don't want to give up too much more either.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take Bob's offer of meeting in the middle and splitting it 50-50. It's not ideal, but it's better than going to another round and losing more value due to inflation!"
