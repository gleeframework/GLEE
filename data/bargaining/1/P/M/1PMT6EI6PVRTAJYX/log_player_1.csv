"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, which I think is a generous starting point. I hope Bob will see it as a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This is the fairest option for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm taking into account the fact that the money is now worth 5% less than in the first round, and I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to Bob's previous offer, but still favorable to me."
