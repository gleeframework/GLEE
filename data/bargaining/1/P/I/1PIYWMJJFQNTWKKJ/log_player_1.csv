"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50-50 split, it's a fair starting point! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since my gains are worth 20% less due to inflation, I'm not as motivated to accept a split that gives me only $5,000.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 55-45?""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, but still aiming to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think 60-40 is a fair split. Will you consider it? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With my money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

While I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, I think I should accept this offer. I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, and Bob's offer is still a decent one.
