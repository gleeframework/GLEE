"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to try to get him to accept quickly, while I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, it's a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gain.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject this offer for now and make a counteroffer in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is still affecting the money, and I need to make a more aggressive offer to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Take this or I'll make you regret it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. I'm getting desperate, indeed!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth significantly less now, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I can afford to reject it.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can salvage some value from the game.
