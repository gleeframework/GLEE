"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
While it seems like Alice is getting a better deal on the surface, the inflation works in my favor as Bob.  It's worth letting the game play out a bit."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:** By taking the initiative in round two, I establish myself as a serious player and shift the dynamic of the negotiation.
* **Strategic Advantage:** While my offer might appear generous at first glance, the devaluation of the money benefits me more in the long run.  
* **Time Pressure:** My message subtly emphasizes the time sensitivity due to inflation. This might nudge Alice towards a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, the value of waiting for a potentially better deal is shrinking rapidly due to the inflation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a significantly better offer in later rounds carries the risk of Alice becoming more assertive and the overall pot becoming less valuable. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable gain, even if it's not the optimal outcome. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting a much smaller amount later."
