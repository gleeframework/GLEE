"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 80% of the initial amount, leaving you with 20%. It's a fair starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

This way, I'll get $8,000 and Bob will get $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

In this round, the total amount is $8,000 (10,000 - 20% inflation). If we split it 50/50, I'll get $4,000 and Bob will get $4,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is fair, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the total amount is now $8,000 (10,000 - 20% inflation).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a slightly smaller share this round. I'll give you $4,000, but I'm willing to negotiate further.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. How about we split it 55/45? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has taken a bite out of the money!

Let's calculate the new amounts. The total amount is now $8,000 (10,000 - 20% inflation in the first round, and 20% inflation again in the second round, and 8% inflation in the third round, so 1 - 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512, or 51.2% of the original amount).

If we split it 55/45, I'll get $4,240 (51.2% of $8,200, which is the amount after 4 rounds of inflation) and Bob will get $5,760.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the larger share for you. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 51.2% of its original value now.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with the negotiations. I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about we split it 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money!

Let's calculate the new amounts. The total amount is now $4,192 (10,000 - 20% inflation in the first round, and 20% inflation in the second round, and 8% inflation in the third round, and 8% inflation in the fourth round, and 6.8% inflation in the fifth round, so 1 - 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.936 = 0.3968, or 39.68% of the original amount).

If we split it 60/40, I'll get $2,553.28 (60% of $4,192) and Bob will get $3,638.72.
