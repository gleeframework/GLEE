"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and I'm curious to see Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, Alice. I'll take a smaller share for now. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a smaller share for himself.

I'll consider his offer and respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a big difference, Bob. I'm not giving up 60% of the money yet.""
}
```

I'm not accepting his offer, and I'm letting him know that I'm not willing to give up such a large share just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a decent share. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm holding firm, Alice. You're getting closer, but I need more. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still pushing for a larger share.

I'll consider his offer and respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too low for me, Bob. I'm not giving up 90% of the money.""
}
```

I'm not accepting his offer, and I'm letting him know that I'm not willing to give up such a large share, even with the inflation adjustments."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
