"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started. Consider this a gentle offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point.  We both get a good share, and it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the 20% decrease in value, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since the total amount is now $8,000 (due to inflation), I'll calculate the actual values:

* Alice gain: $4,000
* Bob gain: $6,000

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a more even split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, the total amount is now $6,400.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for future negotiations. Consider this a compromise.""
}
```"
