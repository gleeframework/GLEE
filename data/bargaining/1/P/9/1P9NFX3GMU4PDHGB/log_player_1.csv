"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I need to recalculate the actual amounts.

My gain would be $4,000 x 0.8 = $3,200 (20% less due to inflation)
Bob's gain would be $6,000 x 0.95 = $5,700 (5% less due to inflation)

However, Bob's offer is still 60-40, which is the same as my initial offer. I'd rather not give up more than I initially proposed. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2. Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the reduced value of money, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split.

My gain would be $3,200 x 0.8 = $2,560 (20% less due to inflation)
Bob's gain would be $5,700 x 0.95 = $5,415 (5% less due to inflation)

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 30-70.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 30% of the remaining $10,000, which is $3,000, and leaving $7,000 for Bob."
