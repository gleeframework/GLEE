Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I understand your point about fairness, but with inflation, waiting isn't ideal for either of us.  This offer gets us a larger share of the money while it's still worth more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of the inflation.  This is my final offer â€“ take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation rate is heavily skewed against Bob, but it's still significantly impacting my potential gains. Waiting any longer means the $100 pot shrinks considerably in real value for both of us.
* **Power Dynamic Shift:** Bob knows his share is diminishing rapidly, making him more desperate to close a deal. However, his ""take it or leave it"" approach in Round 4 suggests he's unlikely to offer anything better in subsequent rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer holds the risk of Bob offering even less in a future round, where the overall value will be significantly diminished. Accepting guarantees a less than ideal, but still reasonable share, before inflation eats away at it further."
