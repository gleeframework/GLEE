Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $100,000. Accept and we can finish the game.""

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, but I'm not willing to give away too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth even less for me, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it. I'm not giving you more.""
}
```"

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the current state of the game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating into my potential gains! With the money worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet. I think I can get a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money continuing to lose value, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next move:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or walk away.""
}
```"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to settle for a small share, I think I deserve more given my previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money worth 67.23% less for me and 22.62% less for Bob, I'm getting desperate.

However, I think I've been too aggressive in my previous offers, and Bob is starting to dictate the terms. I'll try to be more realistic and accept his offer. I'll take the 300,000 and hope that it's enough to get a decent outcome.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, I'll take 300,000. Let's end this.""
}
```"
