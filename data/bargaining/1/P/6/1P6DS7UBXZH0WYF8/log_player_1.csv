"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the first round, I would have received $5,000, but due to inflation, that's now equivalent to $4,000. So, Bob's offer is actually a decrease from my original expectation.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000
}"
