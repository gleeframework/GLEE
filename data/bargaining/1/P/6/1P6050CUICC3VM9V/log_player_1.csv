"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of the original $500,000, which is $400,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 95% of the original $500,000, which is $570,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting a 42.5% share of the remaining amount, considering he's getting a relatively larger share than me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 40%. I'm offering you a 58% share, but I'm not budging further""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on my previous offer, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $450,000 is worth 45% of the original $500,000 from round 1, which is $225,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55% of the original $500,000 from round 1, which is $275,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is still getting a larger share. I'll reject this offer.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up more. This is my final compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage."
