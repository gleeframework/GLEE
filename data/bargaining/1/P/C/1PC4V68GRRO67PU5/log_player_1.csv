"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking 90% of the money and giving Bob 10%. I figure this is a good starting point, as it's a relatively fair split, and it gives Bob some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting a smaller share, I'm still losing money due to inflation. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to lower my share to 80% and give Bob 20%. This is a significant increase for Bob, and I hope it's enough to convince him to accept. Inflation is working against me, and I need to finalize a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it is a significant increase from his previous offer, inflation has eroded my share to the point where I am still losing money overall. I need to secure a much larger portion of the money to make this worthwhile for me, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the money, which is a significant increase from his previous offer. Inflation is hitting hard, and I need to finalize a deal quickly. This is a good compromise, and I hope Bob sees it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than his previous offer, it still leaves me with a significantly smaller share and a loss due to inflation. I need to secure a more substantial share of the money to make this worthwhile. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a big increase from his last offer. Inflation is making this game increasingly difficult for me, and I need to finalize a deal soon. This is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob sees it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even though it is an increase from his previous offer, the inflation is making it hard for me to accept a deal that leaves me with less than half the money. I am hopeful that I can negotiate a more equitable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left, the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to gain anything.  I propose a 50/50 split. It's the most equitable solution given the circumstances.  This offers Bob a significant gain from his previous offer and gives me something worthwhile after accounting for inflation."
