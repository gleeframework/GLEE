"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent share, but not too greedy.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more cautious. However, this offer seems reasonable.
