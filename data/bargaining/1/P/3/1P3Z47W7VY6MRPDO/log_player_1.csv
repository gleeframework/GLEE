"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to get a bigger share. However, 55% is still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
