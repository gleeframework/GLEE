"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1

This offer is incredibly unfair. I'll take my chances with the next round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose a more equitable split: 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Alice. This ensures a significant share for me while still giving Alice something."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation means the money I'll get is worth much less.  It's better to take 100,000 now than risk getting nothing."
