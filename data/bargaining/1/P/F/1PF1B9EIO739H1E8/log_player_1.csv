I'm going to try and get as much as possible in the first round, hoping Bob doesn't realize how much the inflation will impact him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Bob is taking advantage of the inflation, and I can do better in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount to Bob this round, hoping he'll see that rejecting my offer in the last round was a mistake. I'm still trying to maximize my gains while being reasonable enough to avoid another rejection."
