"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you can take 10%""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and leaving $100,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
