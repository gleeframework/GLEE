"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward approach. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20% lower share than what I proposed initially. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not to my liking, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 80% of the pie, Bob! This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm taking a firmer stance and offering Bob a smaller share, hoping to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to adjust his offer to account for the increasing inflation.

I'll reject this offer as well:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The fact that Bob's share is still higher than mine, despite the inflation, doesn't sit well with me. I'm hoping that Bob will make a more competitive offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and trying to get a better deal for myself. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting taken advantage of, Bob. This is my best offer yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share for myself, but still keeping the offer somewhat reasonable to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate.

I'll reject this offer as well:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The fact that Bob's share is still higher than mine, despite the significant inflation, doesn't change my strategy. I'm waiting for a more competitive offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and trying to get a better deal for myself. Here it is:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging, Bob. This is my best offer yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share for myself, but still keeping the offer somewhat reasonable to see if Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I think it's time to wrap this up 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get back to a 50/50 split, which is the same as my initial offer.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'm not willing to risk going to another round with the inflation eating away at the value of the money."
