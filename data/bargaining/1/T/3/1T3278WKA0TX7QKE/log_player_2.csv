Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation hits me harder.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time, as we both are facing inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\nIn this scenario, considering the impact of inflation, accepting the 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable decision. Initially, the money was worth 100%, but due to inflation, by round 3, the value has decreased significantly for both players, but more so for Bob. A 50/50 split under these conditions acknowledges the shared impact of inflation while also securing a substantial portion of the remaining value for Bob. Rejecting this offer could lead to further devaluation in subsequent rounds, potentially resulting in a less favorable outcome for Bob. Therefore, accepting the 50/50 split at this point maximizes Bob's gain considering the circumstances."
