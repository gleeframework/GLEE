"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering Bob $40, and keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
* Bob gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I'll accept Bob's offer.
