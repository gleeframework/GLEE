This offer is extremely unfair. It's better to try and negotiate a fairer deal."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a more fair offer that splits the money closer to 50/50. I'm willing to give Alice a slight advantage, but I don't want to be completely taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice is still trying to get a much larger share of the money. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm willing to increase my offer to $480,000. I want to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give up more than half of the money."
