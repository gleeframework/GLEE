"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts I would get in Round 2 would be:

* My gain: 8000 * 0.8 = 6400
* Bob's gain: 2000 * 0.8 = 1600

Considering the new offer from Bob, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. To make my offer, I'll consider the current value of the money.

Since the money is worth 40% of its original value, my goal is to get as much as possible. I'll aim for 60% of the current value, which is equivalent to 40% of the original value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This offer gives me 40% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 60%."
