**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with inflation increasing, Alice is clearly aiming to secure a larger share.  My offers have been reasonable. It's time to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A perfectly even split. Take it now before inflation hurts us both even more. ""
}
```

**Reasoning:**   It's time to send a strong signal that I'm not going to back down from a fair split.  Offering a 50/50 split puts the pressure on Alice. It highlights the increasing impact of inflation, making it clear that further negotiation might lead to a worse outcome for her."
