This is still not a good deal for me. Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation, but I know I can get a better offer if I hold out a bit longer."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A perfectly even split. Take it now before inflation hurts us both even more.  
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is the best offer I'm likely to get. Accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting a worse deal later as inflation eats into the pot."
