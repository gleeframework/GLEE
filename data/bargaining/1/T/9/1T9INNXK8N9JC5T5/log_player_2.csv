"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but I'm willing to share a little. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer because Alice is taking the majority of the money, and I think I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round in hopes of getting a more favorable offer. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it more fairly, we both deserve a good share.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll try to get a larger share to make up for the loss. I'm offering Alice a significant amount, but I believe I deserve a bigger portion. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer!"
