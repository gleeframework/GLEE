**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, as Alice is clearly applying pressure and calling this her final offer. However, accepting such a low amount when we are closer to the deadline hurts more than it benefits. It's a gamble, but I'll make a final counter-offer and hope she sees the value in securing a deal."
