"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me $900,000 and Bob $100,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering we're playing a game of strategy and we're both risking losing money due to inflation.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 10% less, which is $810,000 (900,000 * 0.9). Bob's offer is now a gain of $100,000 for me and $810,000 for him.

Considering the offer, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, which is $729,000 (810,000 * 0.9). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's find a sweet spot.""
}
```

This offer gives me $700,000 and Bob $300,000. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob!"
