"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, Bob! I'm willing to give you a generous offer to get us out of this quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In terms of the original $1,000,000, Bob's offer is equivalent to:

$800,000 / 0.95 = $842,105.26 (original value)

And my share would be:

$200,000 / 0.95 = $210,526.32 (original value)

Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. You're getting a better deal than I should give you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting hard! 

Let's calculate the original value of Bob's offer:

$600,000 / 0.85874 (1 - 0.14126) = $697,319.21 (original value)

And my share would be:

$400,000 / 0.85874 = $466,419.19 (original value)

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually a bit better than my previous one, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob the upper hand. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm not going to back down, Bob. Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which might be a more reasonable deal considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting 50/50, Alice. I'm taking control now. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll now!

Let's calculate the original value of Bob's offer:

$700,000 / 0.77738 (1 - 0.22262) = $899,761.14 (original value)

And my share would be:

$300,000 / 0.77738 = $386,221.43 (original value)

This offer is getting worse and worse for me. I'll reject it and try to make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, Bob. You're getting closer to the bottom line, but I'm still holding firm.""
}

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, but still being somewhat reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now!

Let's calculate the original value of Bob's offer:

$850,000 / 0.69783 (1 - 0.30217) = $1,215,319.65 (original value)

And my share would be:

$150,000 / 0.69783 = $215,119.51 (original value)

This offer is getting ridiculous! I'm not going to accept this. I'll reject it and try to make a new proposal.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up now, Bob. I'll take back control and make a final offer.""
}
```

I'm reverting back to my original proposal from Round 1, but with a bit more urgency in the message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're making a mistake, Alice. This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really ravaging the value of the money now!

Let's calculate the original value of Bob's offer:

$900,000 / 0.63202 (1 - 0.36798) = $1,420,509.94 (original value)

And my share would be:

$100,000 / 0.63202 = $158,253.59 (original value)

This is an insult! I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to make a new proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to let you walk all over me, Bob. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm trying to maximize my own gain in these desperate times."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not taking anything, Alice. I'm taking it all. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has ravaged the value of the money to the point where even $1,000 is almost worthless!

Let's calculate the original value of Bob's offer:

$999,000 / 0.56688 (1 - 0.43312) = $1,760,113.17 (original value)

And my share would be:

$1,000 / 0.56688 = $1,764.28 (original value)

At this point, I'm not even getting a rounding error. This is an insult. I refuse to accept this offer.

However, I also know that if I reject this offer, we'll both end up with nothing. So, I'll accept this offer, not because it's a good deal, but because it's the only way to salvage something.
