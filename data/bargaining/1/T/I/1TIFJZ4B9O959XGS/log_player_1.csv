"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly.  I'm also taking into account the inflation, so I'm aiming for a large share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than mine, and I'm not willing to accept such a low share.  I'll take my chances with the next round.  I'm hoping he'll realize that he's risking losing even more if he keeps rejecting offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share for myself this round. This is a compromise to avoid a stalemate, while still aiming for a good portion of the money.  The inflation is starting to take effect, so I need to be more strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very low, and the inflation is really starting to bite now. I need to take control and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  We're getting closer to the middle, and I want to try to find a point where Bob might be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. The inflation is really hurting me now, but I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'm starting to worry that we might not be able to reach an agreement before the money runs out completely."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, hoping to find a compromise. The inflation is hitting us both hard, and I need to start considering that we may not be able to get the best deal anymore.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair solution and accepts it before we both lose too much."
