Alice is clearly trying to push me to a worse deal as time goes on.  While the offer is getting closer to something I might consider, I think I can still get her to agree to a more balanced split."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, I'll take a smaller edge. Don't let inflation eat our money! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and the money is losing value rapidly. 
* **Alice's Pattern:** Alice seems fixated on getting more than me, but her offer did improve slightly. It's unlikely she'll drastically change her stance now.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer is risky. We could end up with nothing.

While not ideal, 4200 is better than nothing."
