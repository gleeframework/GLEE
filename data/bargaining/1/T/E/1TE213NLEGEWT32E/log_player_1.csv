"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. No need to play games with inflation this early on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's proposal is reasonable, and splitting the money evenly at this point is a good idea. It's a fair compromise, and we can reassess our strategy in future rounds."
