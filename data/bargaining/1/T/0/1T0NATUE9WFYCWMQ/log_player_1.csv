"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing that I get 700,000 and Bob gets 300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think splitting it evenly is the fairest option, especially since Bob gets to keep more of the money in real terms due to the inflation difference. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
