6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair! I propose we split the money 60/40. I believe this is a reasonable starting point.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's try a 55/45 split. I think this is a more even starting point, considering the inflation hits me harder.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I understand inflation hits you harder, but I'm also losing value. Let's compromise with a 55/45 split in my favor. This way, we both get a slightly better deal than the previous round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Considering I've lost 19% of the value already, I think a 58/42 split in my favor is a fair compromise. The longer we wait, the more I lose.",Bob,4,
