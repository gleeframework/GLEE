"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll take a slight lead""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""slight lead"" to make it sound like a reasonable and fair proposal."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal to meet in the middle. I was hoping to get a slightly better deal, considering I was willing to give him a ""slight lead"" in the first round. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal than the middle ground, but I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's proposal to give him a bigger share of the pie. I was hoping to get a better deal after rejecting his previous offers, but this one is even worse. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but considering the severe inflation and the fact that the money is worth much less than it was initially, I think I should take what I can get. I'll accept this offer and hope that Bob will keep his word."
