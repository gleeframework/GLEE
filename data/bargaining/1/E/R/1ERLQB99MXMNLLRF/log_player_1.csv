I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself as I am the one making the first offer.  Let's see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. Although he is offering a significant amount, it is still significantly less than what I was initially offered and worth less due to inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm offering a 85/15 split in my favor. This is still a significant amount for Bob, and it's important for me to maintain a strong position."
