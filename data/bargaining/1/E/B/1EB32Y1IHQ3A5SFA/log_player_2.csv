"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth is only hurting us both. Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a larger share than your last proposal would be worth after another round of inflation.  Take the deal while you still can! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using psychological tactics, but I need to focus on the numbers. While her offer seems generous on the surface, it's important to remember that with each round, the value diminishes significantly for me. 

* **My situation:** Even though Alice's offer is larger than what I would have received in Round 2 after another round of inflation,  it's still a significant loss compared to what I could have gained initially.
* **Alice's perspective:**  She's likely feeling the pressure of inflation too, even if it's not impacting her as severely. She's aiming to close the deal quickly.

I believe I still have some bargaining power.  Alice's next offer might be even better since she seems eager to avoid further inflation losses."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, this is hurting both of us. Let's meet in the middle. This offer acknowledges the impact of inflation and gives us both a reasonable share.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer is a significant move towards Alice's position while still securing me a larger share than her last offer (even after another round of inflation).  
* **Time Pressure:** It's important to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but I also need to act quickly.  Every round significantly reduces the value, especially for me.  
* **Psychology:**  By acknowledging Alice's point about the deal hurting both of us, I'm hoping to create a sense of cooperation and urgency."
