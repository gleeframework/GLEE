"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since my gain is worth 20% less than before, I need to adjust my thinking.

I'll think about it for a moment... Ah, I've decided!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not giving me enough. I'm starting to think you're just stalling! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's getting a bit aggressive!

Considering the inflation, my gain is worth a lot less than before, and Bob's offer is still not very appealing. However, I'm running out of time and options.

After careful consideration, I've decided:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. I'm hoping to make a better deal in the next round, but I'm getting a bit worried about running out of time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still trying to be fair. Take it or leave it!""}

I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm getting worried that I'll end up with nothing if I don't make a good offer soon. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
