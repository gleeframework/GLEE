I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the money quickly and avoid any potential inflation.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a serious factor. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half the money, and with each round the value of what I'd get in a later round will decrease further. It's time to cut my losses and secure something."
