"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the difference!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple solution! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 50/50 split, huh? That's a bold move!

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his gain of 500,000$ is actually 500,000 * 0.8 = 400,000$ in real value. My gain of 500,000$ is still worth 500,000$.

I'm not sure if I want to give up my advantage, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to take advantage of the situation by making a new offer that favors me. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You should take the safe route and accept this offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to accept the offer and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to negotiate again!

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in the first round, and another 28.8% less in the second round, his gain of 420,000$ in the third round is actually worth 420,000 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 201,600$ in real value. My gain of 580,000$ is still worth 580,000$.

I'm not sure if I want to give up my advantage, but Bob's offer is a bit more generous than before. I'll consider it...

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to the edge, don't push your luck!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000$ and keeping 800,000$ for myself. The message is a warning that I'm not going to be flexible, and Bob should accept the offer before things get worse."

# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is still trying to negotiate!

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in the first round, and another 28.8% less in the second round, and another 24.23% less in the third round, and another 20% less in the fourth round, and another 17.23% less in the fifth round, his gain of 350,000$ in the fifth round is actually worth 350,000 * 0.6 * 0.8 * 0.6 * 0.8 * 0.7823 = 136,394$ in real value.

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is still holding on!

My gain of 550,000$ is still worth 550,000$.
