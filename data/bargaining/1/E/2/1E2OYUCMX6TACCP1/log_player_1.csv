# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4000, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less than the original amount, I'll make a counteroffer that's also worth 10% less than my original offer.

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much. Let's meet in the middle!""}
