"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very strong offer, hoping Bob will be tempted to take it. I'll get almost all the money and leave just a small amount for him.  We'll see if he's willing to play the long game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would love to keep pushing for a larger share, it's clear Bob is not afraid to wait.  With the inflation affecting his offer, it's better to secure a fair split than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
