It's painful, but accepting is the best option at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me. Waiting any longer means getting even less.
* **Bob is unlikely to budge:** Bob knows about the inflation working against me and is using it to his advantage. He's consistently pushing for a larger share, and there's no guarantee he'll offer anything better than this. 
* **Something is better than nothing:**  Getting $440,000 is a lot better than walking away with nothing if we reach a stalemate.

This situation highlights the power dynamics when one party can wait out the other."
