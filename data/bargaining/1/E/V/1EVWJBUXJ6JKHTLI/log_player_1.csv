"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less to show good faith.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly gesture to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $240,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $630,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of $300,000 in Round 2 is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round, which is $192,000. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bigger share, considering the inflation""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is worth $640,000 in real terms, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $600,000 in Round 3 is now worth 46.4% of what it was in the first round, which is $288,000. I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value."
