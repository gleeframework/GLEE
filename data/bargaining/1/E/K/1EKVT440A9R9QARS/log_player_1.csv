Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split. I'll take the larger share, but it's a reasonable starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  it's better to take the 400,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round due to inflation."
