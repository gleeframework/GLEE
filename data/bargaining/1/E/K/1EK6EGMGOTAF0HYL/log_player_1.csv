I'll take 90% and let Bob have 10%. It's a good starting point, and if he rejects it, I'll know he's greedy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being really greedy! I'll take my chances and propose my own split in the next round."

I'll lower my share a little to 70% hoping Bob will see reason. I'm willing to compromise, but not to be taken advantage of."
