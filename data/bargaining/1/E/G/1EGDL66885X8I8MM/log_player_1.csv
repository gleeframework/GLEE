"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll still give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not too thrilled about giving up 10$ compared to the initial offer, but I also don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value due to inflation. Let's go with the safer option.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
