"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000 is now worth 4000 in real terms. I'd rather not accept this offer, as I'd like to aim for a higher real value. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time, taking into account the reduced purchasing power due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 5200 in real terms, which is actually a better deal than my previous offer. Considering that Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think this is a good opportunity to accept the offer.
