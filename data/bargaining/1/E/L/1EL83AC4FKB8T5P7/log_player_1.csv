"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to start with a fair but firm offer. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  Let's see if he wants to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is much worse for me than the first round, even with the inflation. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to 70%, leaving Bob with 30%. I hope this will be more appealing to him, especially considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still worse than the first round even after the inflation. I need a better deal if I'm going to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to concede a bit more and offer 60% to Bob, hoping this will be enough for him to accept. Time is running out and inflation is hitting hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting worse and worse for me!  I'm going to continue to reject and see if I can get a better deal.  Time is running out, but I'm hoping Bob will realize he needs to make me a more appealing offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. We're both losing a lot of money due to inflation, and a fair split might be the only way we can get anything at all."
