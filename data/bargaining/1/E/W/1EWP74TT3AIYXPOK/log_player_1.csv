"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll calculate my gain in the second round as 600000 * 0.8 = 480000.

Bob's offer is still 400000 for me, which is worth 20% less than my original 600000, but I'll accept it anyway.
