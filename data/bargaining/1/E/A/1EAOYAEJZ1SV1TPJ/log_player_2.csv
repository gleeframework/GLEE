"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, the proposed advantage for her is too significant.  It's early in the game, and I have some leverage to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's make it simple and fair. 50/50 split.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm proposing a 50/50 split in Round 2 for a few reasons:

* **Fairness:**  It's a clean and easily understandable division, demonstrating my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Time Pressure:** While I believe I have some leverage, the value of the money decreases with each round. A 50/50 split now avoids the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree.
* **Strategic Positioning:** A fair offer might make Alice more amenable to a deal, especially considering she'll be subject to my counter-offers if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer still considers the inflation disadvantage you face. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but her offer still significantly favors her. While the inflation is a factor, accepting a deal where I consistently get less than 50% isn't in my best interest.  I need to show Alice I'm serious about a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This offer is a good compromise, slightly favoring me to account for the inflation.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Shift:** I'm shifting my strategy to push for a slightly advantageous split in my favor. This is to counterbalance the effect of inflation as rounds progress. 
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value decreases, making it riskier to hold out for a perfectly equal deal. 
* **Compromise:** While I'm seeking a slight advantage, the offer is still reasonable and shows Alice I'm willing to compromise.  It's crucial to find an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and this offer still provides a reasonable share considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4850 
# Alice gain: 5150 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's getting dangerously close to the deadline. While this offer is still not ideal, it's better than what I might get in later rounds as inflation eats into my potential gains. Alice is clearly aware of the time pressure and unlikely to budge significantly. Accepting now secures a reasonable sum, even if it's slightly less than I aimed for initially."
