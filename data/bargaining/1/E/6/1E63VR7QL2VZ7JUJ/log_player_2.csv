{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split closer to the middle, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge to account for the inflation difference.""}

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increased inflation impact on you, I'll take a bit more but still offer a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While it's not ideal, this offer is better than the previous one considering the inflation impact."
