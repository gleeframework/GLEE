"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn to propose a split closer to the middle.  Let's wrap this up - time is money! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game.
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money's value decreases by 5% with each round due to inflation. So far, both players have rejected each other's offers.

### Step 2: Calculate the current value of the money.
Given that the money's value decreases by 5% each round, and we are in Round 4, we need to calculate the current value of the $10,000.

### Step 3: Determine a suitable offer.
Considering the decreasing value of money and the need to come to a mutually agreeable split, we should aim for a division that is closer to 50/50 but also takes into account the urgency to finalize the deal due to inflation.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer and message.
Given the above considerations, let's propose a split that slightly favors Alice to incentivize her to accept, considering the urgency and the fact that she has been offered less than half in previous rounds.

### Step 5: Finalize the offer.
Bob's gain will be slightly less than Alice's to encourage acceptance, but not so low as to be unfair given the game's progression.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle to benefit both of us. Time is indeed money, and further delays will only decrease our gains.""}"
