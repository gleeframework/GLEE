Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 90:10 in my favor.  This is a fair deal considering the risk of inflation.  Accept this offer and we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 10
