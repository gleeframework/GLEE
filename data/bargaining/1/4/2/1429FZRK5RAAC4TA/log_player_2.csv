# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a slight edge for me, reflecting the reality of the situation. Take it, or we both lose out as this money dwindles. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I'd prefer an even split, with the inflation hitting harder, I'm better off accepting this offer and securing some gain, even if it's not ideal."
