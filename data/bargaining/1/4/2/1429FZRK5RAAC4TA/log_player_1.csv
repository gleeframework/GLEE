Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. We're both losing money with every passing round.  Splitting it evenly is the fairest way to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer sounds fair on the surface, the impact of inflation makes it heavily skewed in his favor. He's trying to leverage the time pressure to secure an even split even though he's losing value at twice the rate. I need to push for a better deal while there's still time, but I also need to be mindful that outright rejections will lead to zero gain for both of us."
