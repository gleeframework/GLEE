"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and take the rest. It's a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, $400,000 is equivalent to $500,000 in the first round. This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can have 55% and I'll take the rest.""
}

I'm trying to be more generous this time, offering Bob a slightly larger share of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 30% and take the rest. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of my potential winnings, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm also not eager to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
