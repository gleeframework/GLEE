"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of $20, I'll have to consider the inflation factor. Since the money is worth 20% less, my $20 is actually worth $16.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to accept it to move on to the next round and try to get a better deal.
