Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping to get the most I can in the first round, as the money will be worth less in future rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best choice.  The inflation means my potential gains are shrinking with each round, and Bob is likely to make progressively less generous offers.  It's better to take $6,000 now than risk getting a smaller amount in the future."
