"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm looking for a compromise.
