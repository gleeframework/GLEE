"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 60-40. This is a fairer split, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still eating away at the value of money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need to get closer to 60%""
}
```

I'm aiming to get a bit more of the pie, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate further."
