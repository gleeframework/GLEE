"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to get the most possible in the first round.  Since the value of the money decreases with each round, it's important to get a good chunk of it early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. My gains will be lower due to inflation in the next round, and there's no guarantee Bob will be as generous. It's better to take what's offered and secure at least some profit."
