# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation (22.62% less than the initial amount), I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate further may result in even greater losses for both parties, so it's best to accept this offer and finalize the agreement."
