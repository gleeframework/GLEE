Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a fairer split. It gives you a good starting point, and avoids us losing any money due to inflation.""}

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse with inflation.  Let's settle this now. I'll take a small hit and say 58/42. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
