Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split. It gives you a good starting point, and avoids us losing any money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
