"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60% for myself, which is $60. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest, let's start there. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll calculate my gain as follows:

$100 x 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation) = $95

If Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll gain $50, which is more than my calculated gain of $47.50 (95 x 0.5). I'll accept the offer.
