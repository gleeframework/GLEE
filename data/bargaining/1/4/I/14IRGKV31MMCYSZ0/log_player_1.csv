Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money. Since there are 12 rounds, I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept even a small amount to avoid losing everything in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52.5 
# Bob gain: 47.5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation factor. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm lowering my offer slightly to make it more appealing to Bob. The inflation factor is starting to become significant, and I want to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
