"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a large majority of the money but also leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money,  accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation means that each round is worth less, and if I reject this, I'm not guaranteed a better deal in the next round."
