Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round, especially for you. I'll take a small cut and offer you $4,800. It's better than what you'll get in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
