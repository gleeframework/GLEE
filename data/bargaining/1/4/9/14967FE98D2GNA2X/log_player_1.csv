"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's my turn now, and I think it's more fair if we split the money equally.  I get $5,500 and you get $4,500. This way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
