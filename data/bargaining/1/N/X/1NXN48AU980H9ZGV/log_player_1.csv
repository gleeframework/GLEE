"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large share of the money, while still giving Bob something. Since we have 12 rounds and the money is worth less with each passing round, it's better to secure a large portion early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get half the money, which is significantly better than the potential of getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's proposals."
