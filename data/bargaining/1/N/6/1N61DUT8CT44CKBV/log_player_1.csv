"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This offer leaves us both with a significant sum, Bob. Let's be reasonable and avoid the effects of inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Early Bird Advantage:**  It's advantageous for Alice to secure a deal quickly. With each round, her potential earnings decrease faster than Bob's.
* **Strong Opening:** This offer gives Alice a favorable split (65/35) while still being substantial enough for Bob to consider seriously.
* **Emphasis on Cooperation:** The message aims to frame the offer as mutually beneficial and encourages Bob to settle quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering the inflation,  Alice. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is framed as fair, the shift in split heavily favors him due to the inflation rates. It's not in Alice's best interest to accept this deal.  She needs to counter with an offer that acknowledges the inflation impact but still secures a better outcome for herself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, my turn and I'm acknowledging the inflation factor. This offer still gives you a good amount and avoids further losses for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Strategy:** Alice is moving slightly closer to a more balanced split, recognizing that Bob is unlikely to accept a deal heavily skewed in her favor.
* **Inflation Awareness:** The message explicitly mentions that Alice is taking inflation into account, making the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Time Pressure:**  Alice continues to emphasize the benefit of ending the game quickly to minimize further losses from inflation."
