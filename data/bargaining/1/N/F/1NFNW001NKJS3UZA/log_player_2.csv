"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split close to 50/50, but I get slightly more as the value decreases for me over time. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to get the best deal I can. While a 50/50 split sounds fair, it's not in my best interest since the money is losing value for me with each round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it closer to 55/45 this time. I'm willing to take a bit less of the money now, but it's worth more to me than waiting another round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share in future rounds, but I need a better offer now to account for the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice is offering to take a smaller share in the future, her offer now is significantly worse than the initial 50/50 split. I'm willing to wait another round and see if we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. I understand the value is decreasing for me, but I think a fair 50/50 split is the best solution for both of us. ""}
