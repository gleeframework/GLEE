  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can both go home with a decent sum!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split in my favor. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too optimistic, let's get real!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount, hoping he'll be willing to accept and we can move on."

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is hitting me hard! I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a pretty good deal for him. I'm not sure I want to give him a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate a better deal, but I'm getting a bit concerned about the time running out!"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, make a better offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a bit more for myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent share. Let's see if he'll bite!"

# Bob's message: It's time to split it down the middle, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now! With the money worth so much less, a 50/50 split is actually a decent deal for me. I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50/50 split and call it a day. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than walking away with nothing!"
