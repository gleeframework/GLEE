"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, where we both get $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get less, but I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'd like to negotiate further. I'm not comfortable with the significant disparity in gains. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a more balanced split""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still keeps the difference between our gains relatively small."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get less than you asked for, but it's a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is pushing for a slightly more unequal split. I'm not thrilled about getting $4,000, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
