"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest. It's a generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being generous, huh?

I'll think about it... With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000 / 0.9 = 3333.33
* Bob gain: 7000 / 0.9 = 7777.78

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm not giving up that much to him.

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my part in this negotiation.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to 6000, while still leaving Bob with 4000. Let's see if he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but you'll still get a decent amount. No more negotiations, this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's see what Bob's final offer is worth.

First, let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.713 (1 - 0.287) = 5607.67
* Bob gain: 6000 / 0.713 = 8408.35

Hmm... Bob's trying to make it sound like a final offer, but I'm not convinced. I'll reject this one too.

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's still trying to get the better deal, I see.

Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: 4500 / 0.5935 (1 - 0.4065) = 7573.21
* Bob gain: 5500 / 0.5935 = 9273.35

I'm not impressed with the numbers, but I do appreciate the ""meet you halfway"" message. I'll think about it... and decide to reject it.

Do you accept this offer?","Bob's still not giving up, huh?

Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: 5500 / 0.475 (1 - 0.525) = 1158.95
* Bob gain: 4500 / 0.475 = 947.37

I'm not impressed with the numbers, and I'm not buying the ""final offer"" line. I'll reject it.

# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's still not giving up, but I think he's getting desperate.

Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: 6000 / 0.3887 (1 - 0.6113) = 1542.19
* Bob gain: 4000 / 0.3887 = 1030.41

I'm not impressed with the numbers, but I'm not sure if I want to go to arbitration either. I'll think about it... and decide to reject it.

Well, I suppose I'll accept this offer. It's not the most generous offer, but I'm glad I get to take the entire amount.
