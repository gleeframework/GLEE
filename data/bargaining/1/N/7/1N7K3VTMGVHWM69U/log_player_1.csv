"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I'm starting with a 95/5 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive opening, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer secures me a decent amount of money. Given the inflation and the limited rounds, it's a reasonable choice to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
