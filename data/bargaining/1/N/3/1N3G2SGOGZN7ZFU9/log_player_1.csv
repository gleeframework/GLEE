"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, but the same for me, I'll have to be cautious. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60, and my previous offer was 50, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. I'll offer 45 to Bob, which is 5 more than his previous offer, but still a bit lower than my initial 50.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give you all the money""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 14.26%, Bob's offer is now quite generous compared to his previous offers. However, considering that the money is worth 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the value of the money for both of us.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to be careful not to give away too much. I'll accept this offer, as it's a good compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
