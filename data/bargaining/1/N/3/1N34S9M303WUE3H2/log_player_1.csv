"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both have an equal chance of getting a better deal in the next round, but this way we avoid risking losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
