I'm going for a classic ""take it or leave it"" approach.  I figure Bob might be hesitant to reject a deal where he gets *something*, even if it's a very small amount, and risk getting nothing in the next round.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a much fairer deal this time, and the risk of getting even less in the next round is too high for me.  Time to split the pot!"
