I'm going to try and be as greedy as possible in the first round. I'll offer Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll accept it since it's better than nothing.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a fair offer.  I'd rather get half the money than nothing!"
