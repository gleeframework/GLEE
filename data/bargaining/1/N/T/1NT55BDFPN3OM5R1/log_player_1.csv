"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to get it over with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering Bob is taking the majority, I'll have to decide whether it's better to accept this offer or risk waiting for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation. Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to increase my chances of getting a better deal.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger share last round, I'll take a bit more this time.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took more last time, I'll take a bit more now, but still a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. Considering Bob's previous offer, I think this one is still a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk waiting for another offer that might be worse.
