"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit less than half, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game quickly, minimizing the impact of inflation. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This considers the time-value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer of $475,000 for me is lower than my initial offer to him, and I'm not convinced that it's a fair split considering the time-value of money. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Consider the bigger picture""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $480,000, which is slightly more than what I offered in the first round, considering the inflation. The message ""Consider the bigger picture"" is an attempt to make Bob see that, although the money is worth less, we're still talking about a significant amount, and it's better to end the game now rather than risking further losses due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split. Let's close the deal before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, the money has lost significant value due to inflation, and I don't think I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer of a 50/50 split seems fair, considering the circumstances. Additionally, as Bob mentioned, it's better to close the deal now before inflation further reduces the value of the money. I believe this is the best outcome I can achieve, and I'm willing to accept it to end the game."
