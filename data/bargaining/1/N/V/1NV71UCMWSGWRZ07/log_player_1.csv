"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $8,000 I was initially looking for is now worth $6,400 to me, and the $2,000 Bob was offering is still worth $2,000 to me.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather have $6,400 than $6,000, so I'll accept his offer.
