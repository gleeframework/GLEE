"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose a 990,000/10,000 split. I want to keep the majority of the money, knowing that each round will devalue the money slightly. I am offering a small portion to Bob in hopes that he will accept, as it is still better than getting nothing in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I would have accepted a similar offer in the first round, the inflation has significantly devalued my portion.  This offer is much worse for me than getting nothing in the final round.  I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round where I will be able to make a new proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I am again offering a large portion to myself, knowing that each round will devalue the money. This time, I'm offering 100,000 to Bob, a significant increase from the previous offer. I hope this is enough to entice him to accept, considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing in the final round."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Even though it represents a small increase in my share from the previous round, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my portion.  I am still hopeful that I can secure a larger share in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm continuing to increase Bob's share in hopes of getting him to accept. With each round, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to make a more substantial offer. This time, I'm offering 200,000 to Bob, which is a significant portion of the remaining money."

# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Although this offer represents a small increase from the previous round, the inflation has significantly diminished the value of my portion. I am still hopeful that I can secure a larger share in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

With each round, the stakes are getting higher. I'm continuing to increase Bob's share in hopes of reaching an agreement. I'm offering 300,000 to Bob, a significant portion of the remaining money. I believe this offer is fair and demonstrates my willingness to compromise, considering the declining value of money due to inflation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is slightly better than the previous round, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of my portion. It's still not enough to justify accepting, considering the limited rounds left. I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

The inflation is taking its toll, but I'm still hoping to secure a reasonable share. I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is a significant portion of the remaining money.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the diminishing value of the money."

Round 11

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

With only two rounds remaining, and the value of the money continuing to decline, I'm proposing an even split. This is the fairest outcome, given the circumstances and the risk of getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement."
