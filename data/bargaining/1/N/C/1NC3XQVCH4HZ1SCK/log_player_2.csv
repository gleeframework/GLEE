"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a decent offer, Bob. Time is money, especially with inflation! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what kind of offer I can get!  I'm not giving up 700,000 without a fight."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  This offer gives us both a significant share, and we can avoid further losses from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a good share considering the rapid inflation affecting you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  While I'd prefer more,  400,000 is a decent amount, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
