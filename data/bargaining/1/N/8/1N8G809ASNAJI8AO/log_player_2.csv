"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering I'm starting the negotiations. Let's wrap this up quickly!

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but it's important we both benefit fairly.  I propose a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor. This considers the time pressure and the risk of inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer was too greedy. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is still favorable to me but acknowledges the time constraint. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still pushing for a significantly larger share. While she's right that time is a factor, she's using it as leverage to pressure me into a bad deal. It's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair solution. I'm proposing 51/49 â€“ a slight edge to me, reflecting the risk I'm taking with further delays. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with every passing round.  I'm offering you 470,000 - that's more than you would have gotten in the previous round! Let's be sensible and end this. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now barely better than what I could expect if I reject and manage to get a 50/50 split in a later round. The risk of further inflation eating into the potential gains outweighs holding out for a slightly better deal."
