Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since Bob's offer is not as favorable to me as my initial offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.

After considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll choose to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.
