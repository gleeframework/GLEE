"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, but leaving a small portion for Bob. This is a classic strategy in negotiation, aiming to establish a starting point and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and represents a significant improvement from his initial offer.  While I could potentially get a slightly larger portion, the risk of further rounds and inflation makes this a reasonable compromise."
