"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a slightly more even split.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but it's important to remember the inflation rate.  Accept this offer and we can avoid the risk of losing more money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rate, I'd rather wait for a better offer. The money I'd gain in this round is still worth 20% less than the initial amount, and I'd rather not settle for a smaller share than what I could get in a later round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Accept this and we can avoid further losses.""
}
```"
