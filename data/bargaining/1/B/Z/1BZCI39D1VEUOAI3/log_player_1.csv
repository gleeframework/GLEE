Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very unequal split, giving Bob only $1.  This is to get the ball rolling and see what kind of response I get from Bob.  It's likely he'll reject this offer, but that's fine â€“ it's just the beginning of the negotiation.  I'll adapt my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer and I'm likely to get a worse deal in the next round. It's better to take what I can now and avoid any potential losses due to inflation."
