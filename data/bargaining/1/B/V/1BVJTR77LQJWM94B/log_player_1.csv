"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share.  This is a fair starting point, given the inflation factor.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced 55/45 split.  Consider that the value of the money decreases faster for you, making this a reasonable deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
