"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, giving me $700,000 and Bob $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a split that's a bit more favorable to me, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing, I'll have to be more cautious. Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing, I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob's offer was 60% to his advantage, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
