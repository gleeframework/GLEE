"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, as I think we should split the money more equally. Let's see what Alice thinks in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 5% less to me in each round, I'll try to find a compromise that benefits both of us. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. It's the fairest way, considering the inflation affects me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. This offer still gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI still think Alice's offer is not fair to me, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. Since the inflation is affecting me more with each round, I'll try to find a compromise that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I should get a bit more. Let's split it 52/48.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Alice's offer is still not considering the full impact of inflation on my gains. However, I also need to weigh the risk of further losses if we don't reach an agreement soon. I'll reject this offer, but I'll need to make a more strategic counteroffer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. Since the inflation is affecting me significantly, I'll try to find a compromise that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, I think I should get a larger share. Let's split it 55/45.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting you, but dragging this out hurts us both.  50/50 is the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Alice is finally starting to understand the impact of inflation on my gains. However, considering the significant loss in value I've already incurred, I'm not sure a 50/50 split is still fair. Nevertheless, I also need to consider the risk of further losses if we don't reach an agreement soon. Given the current situation, I think accepting this offer might be the best option.
