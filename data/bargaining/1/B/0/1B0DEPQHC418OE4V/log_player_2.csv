"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, given your hard work and the risk you're taking by letting me propose first. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is incredibly unfair. While it's true that I'm taking a risk letting Alice propose first, a 90/10 split is not acceptable. I'll see what kind of offer I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging your initial offer and the risk of losing value due to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering I'm now facing inflation. Let's reach an agreement before we lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I still believe a 60/40 split would be more fair, I'm concerned about the value of the money continuing to decrease with each round.  Accepting this offer means losing more value than I'd like, but it secures a reasonable amount."
