Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time.  Inflation is biting, and we need to be fair to each other. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and inflation is making things worse with each round.  It's better to take what we can get now."
