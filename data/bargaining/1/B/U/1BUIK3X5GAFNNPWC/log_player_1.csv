"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and minimize the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I appreciate Bob's improved offer, it's still not in my best interest.  Inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, and I can likely negotiate a more favorable outcome in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, hoping to find a middle ground.  Since inflation continues to erode the value, I'm trying to secure a bigger share while leaving Bob with a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable due to the effects of inflation. Even though it's a significant gain for me compared to the previous round, it's still not worth accepting given the dramatic decrease in value. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, trying to bridge the gap and avoid a complete stalemate. I'm still focused on securing a larger share, but I'm also acknowledging the impact of inflation on Bob's side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly lopsided, and the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money. I'm determined to secure a more equitable split, even if it means pushing the negotiation further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Given the escalating impact of inflation, I'm proposing an even split. This is a compromise that acknowledges the diminishing value of the money for both of us.  I hope Bob will see the logic in this approach and agree to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair due to the combined effects of inflation and his relentless drive for a larger share. While I understand the dwindling value of the money, accepting this offer would be a significant loss. I'm determined to hold out for a more equitable solution, even if it means risking getting nothing in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

The time for compromise is now. I'm taking a calculated risk by increasing Bob's share.  This offer acknowledges the significant impact of inflation on both of us and provides a possibility for a win-win scenario.  I hope Bob recognizes this opportunity before the remaining rounds bring even more uncertainty and further erode the value of the money."
