I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split, keeping the majority for myself while still giving Bob a decent share.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'm disappointed that I didn't get a larger share, the inflation is a real concern.  Accepting this 50/50 split ensures that I still receive a significant amount of money, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round due to further inflation."
