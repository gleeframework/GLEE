"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to counter! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to try to negotiate.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split. I think I can do better than that. It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and I think 55-45 is a reasonable compromise."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the middle, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get the upper hand.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because I still think I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""message"": ""Getting close to the middle, let's shake on it!""

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""

I'm accepting Bob's offer! A 50-50 split is a fair and reasonable compromise, and I'm glad we could finally agree on a deal. Let's shake on it!"
