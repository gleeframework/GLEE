I'm going to be greedy and take the lion's share in this first round!  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept that offer.  I'm hoping he does, because if not, the inflation is going to start eating away at my potential winnings!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While I'm aware of the inflation, and the value of my potential gains is shrinking,  I'm not going to accept a deal where I only get $1,000 while Bob gets $9,000! I'm going to see if I can negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference this time, aiming for a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm still aware of the inflation, but I'm hoping that Bob is willing to compromise a bit to avoid going through more rounds."
