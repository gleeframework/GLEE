Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it to get something rather than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting this offer."
