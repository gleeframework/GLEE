Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 2 of the game. In Round 1, Alice offered a division of $100 where she would take $60 and I, Bob, would take $40. I rejected this offer.

### Step 2: Determine my strategy
Given that I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn to make a proposal. Since Alice's initial offer was not acceptable to me, I need to come up with a division that I find more favorable but still might be acceptable to Alice to avoid further rounds.

### Step 3: Decide on my offer
Considering the goal is to reach an agreement, I should make an offer that slightly improves my share but still leaves room for negotiation. Aiming for a bit more than half seems reasonable, as it gives me a better share than Alice's initial offer but doesn't leave her with so little that she's likely to reject outright.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer
I will offer a division where I take $55 and Alice takes $45. This division gives me more than Alice's initial offer but is still within a range that might be acceptable to her, considering we are trying to reach a mutually agreeable solution.

### Step 5: Attach a message to the offer
My message to Alice will emphasize the fairness of this division, highlighting that it's closer to an equal split than her initial offer but still acknowledges her desire for a slightly larger share by not splitting it perfectly evenly.

### Step 6: Send the offer in the requested JSON format
The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Aiming for a bit more fairness with this offer.""}"
