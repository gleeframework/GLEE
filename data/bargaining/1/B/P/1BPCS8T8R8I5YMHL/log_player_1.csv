"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 

I'm going to propose a very lopsided deal in my favor. I figure Bob will likely reject it, but I'll get the ball rolling and see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot better than my first proposal, but I'm not going to accept it yet. I want to see if I can get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a more even split, but still keeping a larger share for myself. Hopefully, this will encourage him to accept, as he's losing more value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering me a larger share than I offered him in the previous round, and I'm still losing out on a significant amount of money. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, but I'm getting nervous. The inflation is starting to get to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest option, considering the inflation is starting to hurt both of us significantly. Hopefully, Bob will recognize this and accept it."
