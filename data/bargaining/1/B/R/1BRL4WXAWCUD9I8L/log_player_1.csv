"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my perception of the offer. 

In this round, I'd be getting 40% of the original $100, but since the money is worth 5% less, I'd effectively get 0.95 * 40 = 38% of the original $100.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

This way, I'll get 45% of the original $100, and Bob will get 55%."
