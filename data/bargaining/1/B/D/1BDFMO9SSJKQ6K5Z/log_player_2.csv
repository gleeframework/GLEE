Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, literally! Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. This offer still gives you a significant share.

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're both trying to maximize our gains, but this back and forth is pointless. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's finally time to accept.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The money is losing value rapidly. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, waiting any longer will erode our share significantly. 
* **Alice is Feeling the Pressure:** Her offer suggests she's more willing to compromise to avoid further losses from inflation.
* **Guaranteed Payoff:** Accepting guarantees us a reasonable sum. Rejecting means risking an even worse offer next round, potentially leaving us with a much smaller amount."
