"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fairness of your proposal, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a more equitable outcome. It accounts for the fact that the money loses value more quickly for you than for me. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
