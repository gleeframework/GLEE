"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give away too much too soon. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

Alice gain: 400,000
Bob gain: 480,000

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a decent chunk for me. I'll accept the offer to move on to the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
