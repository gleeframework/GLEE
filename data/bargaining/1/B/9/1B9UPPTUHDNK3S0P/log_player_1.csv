"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll give you a good start.  You'll get more money if you accept this, trust me! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob thinks he's being generous, but I'm not convinced!

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 300,000 x 0.8 = 240,000
* Bob's gain: 700,000 x 0.8 = 560,000

Considering the reduced value, I'd rather wait for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for my patience!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which I think is a fair compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
