"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 in Round 2 is only worth $4000 in real value.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of my potential gain in Round 4. Initially, I was offered $8000 in Round 1, which is now worth 20% less due to inflation. In Round 2, I was offered $5000, which is worth 20% of the original $8000, or 25% of the original amount. In Round 3, I was offered $6000, which is worth 75% of the original $8000, or 75% of the original amount. In Round 4, I'm being offered $4000, which is worth 50% of the original $8000, or 62.5% of the original amount.

Since the money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round, his gain of $6000 is still worth $6000.

Considering the inflation effect, my potential gain of $4000 in Round 4 is actually worth $2500 in real value. This is a better offer than what I would get if I wait for Round 5.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
