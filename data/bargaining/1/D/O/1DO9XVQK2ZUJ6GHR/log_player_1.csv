"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, considering the inflation factor. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting only 20% of the initial $1,000,000, while Bob will get 80%. 

I'll reject this offer. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its initial value due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

This time, I'll aim for a more balanced split, considering the reduced value of the money."
