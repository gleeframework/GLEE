I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer. I want to keep 90% of the money, but I'm still leaving Bob with something. Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept. While I would prefer more, the inflation makes this a fair deal for me."
