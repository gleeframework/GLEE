"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\nThe reasoning behind the offer is that since the money loses value for Bob at a rate of 20% per round, and I, Alice, do not lose any value, I am in a more advantageous position as the rounds progress. Thus, my initial offer gives me a slightly larger share to reflect this advantage, while still being generous enough to potentially be acceptable to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money for him in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think I deserve a larger share. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nThe reasoning behind the rejection is that Bob's offer does not take into account the fact that the money loses value for him at a rate of 20% per round, but not for me. Accepting this offer would mean I'm not leveraging my advantage in the game. Furthermore, since we're only in Round 2 and there are 10 more rounds to go, there's ample opportunity for me to negotiate a better deal. Given the decreasing value of the money for Bob, he is under more pressure to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the decreasing value for you""}\n\nThe reasoning behind this offer is to further emphasize the advantage I have due to the inflation affecting Bob's gains. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less with each passing round, and we are now in Round 3, the pressure on Bob to accept an offer increases. My offer still gives Bob a significant amount but reflects the urgency and disadvantage he faces due to inflation. By slightly increasing my share, I'm pushing Bob to make a decision while still leaving room for negotiation in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing quickly, let's settle this. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nThe reasoning behind the rejection is that Bob's offer still doesn't adequately reflect the significant decrease in value he's experiencing due to inflation. By Round 4, Bob's share is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which puts immense pressure on him to settle. Given that I have not experienced any loss in value and we still have 8 rounds left, I can afford to wait for a better offer or make subsequent offers that increasingly favor me. Bob's claim that this is his ""final offer"" is likely a bluff, as the rules of the game incentivize him to reach an agreement sooner rather than later due to the devaluing of his potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""You're running out of time""}\n\nThe reasoning behind this offer is to further leverage the pressure Bob is under due to the rapidly decreasing value of his potential gains. By this round, Bob's share would be worth even less, making the urgency to accept an offer even greater. My increased share in this offer reflects this dynamic, making it clear that with each passing round, I am willing to offer less due to my advantageous position. The message is a reminder to Bob of the time-sensitive nature of the negotiations, emphasizing that the longer he waits, the less he stands to gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The reasoning behind the rejection is that Bob's offer to split the money evenly ignores the significant disadvantage he faces due to inflation. By Round 6, his share is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, which means an even split would actually be highly favorable to him at this point. Given my advantageous position and the fact that we still have 6 rounds left, I can afford to wait for a better offer or continue to make offers that favor me even more. Accepting an even split now would not strategically leverage the pressure Bob is under due to the devaluing of his potential gains.\n###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""You should have taken the earlier offers""}\n\nThe reasoning behind this offer is to continue leveraging the pressure Bob is under due to the rapidly decreasing value of his potential gains. By Round 7, Bob's share would be worth even less, increasing the urgency for him to accept an offer. My increased share in this offer reflects this dynamic, making it clear that with each passing round, I am willing to offer less due to my advantageous position. The message serves as a reminder to Bob that he had the opportunity to accept more favorable offers in earlier rounds and that his decision to hold out has put him in an increasingly difficult position. This aims to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is the best decision he can make under the current circumstances."
