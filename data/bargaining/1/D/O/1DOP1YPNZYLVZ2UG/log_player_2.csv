Round 5

# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is correct that the value is decreasing, she's still trying to take a larger share.  I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the deadline approaches."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, don't wait any longer 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking to a slight advantage, but the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Accepting a 49/51 split now is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
