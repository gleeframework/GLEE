"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively fair split, considering I'm getting the larger share. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll give you a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of our potential earnings.

I'm not too pleased with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 30% of the total amount. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my price, but still a bit off! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite, and my potential earnings are decreasing rapidly.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm getting closer to his price. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 45% of the total amount. I'll try to make another offer in the next round to get closer to a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating into our earnings now.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway and propose a 50/50 split, hoping he'll accept and we can finally end the game."
