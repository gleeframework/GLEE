This is a tough situation. While accepting only $40 is far from ideal, it's the best I can realistically hope for at this point. 

Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money is plummeting for me with each round.  Waiting any longer means I'll likely get even less.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems determined to exploit the situation and is unlikely to offer anything better. 

Accepting a bad deal is a bitter pill to swallow, but the alternative is risking an even worse outcome."
