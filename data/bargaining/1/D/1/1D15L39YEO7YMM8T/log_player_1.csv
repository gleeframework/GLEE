"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This is a good starting point, and gives Bob a small incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my share to 700,000, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  While the inflation has hurt me, I'm betting that Bob might be willing to compromise to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'm getting, it's still better than the risk of getting nothing in the next round. Bob's offer is close to what I'd get if I rejected and offered a 50/50 split in the next round, and accepting avoids the risk of him rejecting my offer and the inflation continuing."
