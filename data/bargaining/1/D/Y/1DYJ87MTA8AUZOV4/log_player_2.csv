"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

It's tempting to take $400,000 right away, but Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. The threat of inflation hurts Alice more than it hurts me, so I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal in a later round."

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

Alice is trying to frame the declining value as a concession on her part, but her offer is still heavily in her favor. I'm willing to hold out a bit longer for a better deal."

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, but she's still trying to hold onto a larger share.  Her ""middle ground"" is still tilted in her favor.  We're getting close to the point where the inflation will start to significantly impact her offers, even if she doesn't acknowledge it. I'll hold out for a better deal."

# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still playing hardball, but the inflation is starting to work in my favor. Her offer is barely better than before, and I'm confident that the pressure will lead to a more favorable split in the next couple of rounds."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's finally happened! Alice is feeling the pressure and offering an even split. While I could gamble on getting an even better deal in the remaining rounds, there's a risk she might not budge from 50/50.  A guaranteed win is better than risking it all now."
