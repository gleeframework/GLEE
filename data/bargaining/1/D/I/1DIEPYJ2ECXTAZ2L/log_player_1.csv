"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, my gain of $900,000 in the first round is now worth 95% of that amount, which is $855,000. So, in this round, I'm effectively getting $200,000, which is 23.5% of the original $855,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I don't want to risk losing more money in subsequent rounds.
