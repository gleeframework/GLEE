"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to get a larger share now to make up for it. I'll accept Bob's offer.
