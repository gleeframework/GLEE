"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both receive $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering a slightly more generous split, with me getting $400,000 and Bob getting $600,000."
