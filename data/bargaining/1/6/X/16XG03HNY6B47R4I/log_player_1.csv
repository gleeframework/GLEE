"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (9000$) while still giving Bob a small amount (1000$). I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's better than nothing, and we both avoid the risk of inflation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than nothing, it still leaves me with significantly less money than Bob. I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation in hopes of securing a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a significant amount of money, but it's more equitable than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to Bob and he will accept it."
