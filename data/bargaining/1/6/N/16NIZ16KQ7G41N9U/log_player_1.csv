"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was hoping for a more even split, but I suppose Bob thinks he's worth more.

Considering the inflation, $4000 is actually worth 95% of what it was in the previous round, so it's still a decent offer.

I'll accept this offer.
