"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my decision. My gain of $450,000 in this round is equivalent to $360,000 in the first round, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is equivalent to $490,000 in the first round.

I'm not sure if this offer is the best I can get, but I'll accept it for now.
