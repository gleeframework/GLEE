"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slight majority. It's only fair.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. My message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, given the inflation we're facing. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the numbers are:

* Alice's gain: 4500 * 0.95 = 4275 (5% less than 4500)
* Bob's gain: 5500 * 0.8 = 4400 (20% less than 5500)

I'm not too thrilled about the new offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
