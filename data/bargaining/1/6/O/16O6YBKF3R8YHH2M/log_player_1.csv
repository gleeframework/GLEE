Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we need to think about.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**Bob's Offer (Round 2):**

* **My Gain (Alice):** $400,000 (worth 20% less next round)
* **Bob's Gain:** $600,000 (worth 5% less next round)

**If I Reject:**

* I risk getting an even worse offer in the next round due to inflation.
* However, I'll also have a chance to propose a counter-offer that's more favorable to me.

**Decision:** This offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor. While the inflation is a concern, I think I can leverage that to negotiate a better deal in the next round.
