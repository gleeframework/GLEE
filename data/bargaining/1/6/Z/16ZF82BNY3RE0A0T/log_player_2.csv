Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my guns. Time is running out, and I need the majority to make this worthwhile. Take it or we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's painful, but at this point, any further delay means the offer will likely be even worse for me, potentially leaving me with nothing. Accepting the $100,000 now is the most logical choice given the circumstances and how the game is structured."
