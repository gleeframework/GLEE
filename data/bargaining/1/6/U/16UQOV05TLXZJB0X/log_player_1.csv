"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll try to make a new proposal that takes into account the 20% inflation. I'll offer a slightly larger share to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, let's see if we can make a deal""}

I'm offering Bob a larger share of $700,000, hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small consolation prize, but I'm still not satisfied with the split 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the money worth only 48.8% of its original value, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm not sure I can do better.
