"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 5% less, so the effective amount I would get from this offer is 40 * 0.95 = 38.

I'll accept this offer.
