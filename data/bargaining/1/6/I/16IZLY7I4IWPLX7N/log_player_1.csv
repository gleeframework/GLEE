Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round. It's risky, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a smaller share to avoid the risk of getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  Even though it's a much smaller share, it's better than getting nothing. There's no guarantee that Bob will make a better offer in the next round, and the risk of inflation getting out of control is too high."
