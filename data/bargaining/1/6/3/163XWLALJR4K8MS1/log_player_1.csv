I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I propose a 55/45 split, with me getting $5500 and Bob getting $4500. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was unfavorable to me, I'm offering a slightly more even split. I believe this is still a fair offer considering the inflation."
