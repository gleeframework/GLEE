"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly biased offer, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as it's still quite biased in his favor. I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and my own gain. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer this time. While it's still not a 50/50 split, it's a better deal than my previous offer and Bob's previous offers. I'm hoping that this is a sign of a willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution."
