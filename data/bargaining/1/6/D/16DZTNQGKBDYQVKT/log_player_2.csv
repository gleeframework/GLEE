Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a fairer split. Inflation is coming, don't be greedy!""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Take it before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
