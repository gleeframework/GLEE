"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip that around. I'll take the bigger share this round, and we can see how things go from there. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a bigger share, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think it's too early to give Bob a bigger share, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a different split that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is slightly more in my favor than the initial offer, but still a compromise. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this one!"
