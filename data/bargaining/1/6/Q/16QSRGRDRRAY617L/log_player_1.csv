"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a more balanced split. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, I'll meet you in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, trying to find a middle ground that's more balanced than my initial offer."
