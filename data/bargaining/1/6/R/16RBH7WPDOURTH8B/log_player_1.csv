"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd rather not give up as much as Bob is proposing. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll aim to keep a higher share for myself. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! Since Bob's offer is similar to the previous one, and the money is worth significantly less now, I'll consider this a relatively good opportunity. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
