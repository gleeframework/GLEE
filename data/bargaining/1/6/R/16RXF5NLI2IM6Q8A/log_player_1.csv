"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to keep a bit more this round, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob keeping more than me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor. Here's my proposal:

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
