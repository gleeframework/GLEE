I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I know Bob will likely reject this, but it's a good way to gauge his strategy and hopefully get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I won't accept this offer. It's just as lopsided as mine, and there's no reason to believe that things will improve for me if I let him make the offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. It seems like the most logical way to reach a fair agreement and end the game."
