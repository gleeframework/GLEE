"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the money is worth 20% less for Alice. I'll wait for the next round to make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60-40 is a fair deal. What do you think, Alice?""}\n\nI've made this offer considering that the money's value decreases by 20% for Alice with each round. I believe 60% for me and 40% for Alice is a reasonable division at this point. Let's see if Alice accepts or decides to proceed to the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, but I think a 70-30 split is a more reasonable compromise.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite Alice's attempt to find common ground, the 70-30 split still seems too skewed in her favor, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on her share. I'll wait for the next round, hoping to negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I believe a 70-30 split in my favor is a reasonable adjustment. Let's conclude the deal before the value drops further.""}\n\nConsidering the cumulative effect of inflation on Alice's share, which is now worth 36% less than in the first round, I'm making an offer that reflects this change. A 70-30 split in my favor seems fair at this point, as it takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Alice. Let's see if Alice is willing to accept this proposal or if she'll choose to proceed, further diminishing the value of her potential gain."
