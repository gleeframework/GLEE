"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation penalty isn't too bad, and I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split, considering we both want to walk away with a good amount.""}\n\nI've taken into account the 5% inflation penalty from the previous round, and I'm hoping Alice will see this as a more balanced offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly.  We both get a good amount, and we avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think this is a fair offer, considering the inflation penalty is increasing. Splitting the money evenly is a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value in future rounds. I'm happy to accept this offer and end the game."
