"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the offer, but I'll have to think carefully about it.

After considering the inflation effects, I realize that the 70% I'd get is actually equivalent to 65% of the initial $100, and the 30% Bob would get is equivalent to 24% of the initial $100.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","After considering the inflation effects, I'll make a new offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let me calculate the equivalent values considering the inflation effects...

The 75% I'd get is equivalent to about 52.5% of the initial $100, and the 25% Bob would get is equivalent to about 12.5% of the initial $100.

Hmm... I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's getting closer to a reasonable split. I'll decide to...
