Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle-ish 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This back and forth is pointless. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit, but not too much 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to hurt, but Alice is still not budging much.  It's getting risky, but holding out for a better offer is still (barely) the better strategy.  If Alice isn't going to be reasonable, we might have to take a less favorable deal in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Look, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle. Let's settle this before inflation hurts us both too much.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  Alice seems content to drag this on, so I need to sweeten the deal a bit to avoid getting a much worse outcome in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but still not quite there 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is getting severe. While this offer isn't ideal, rejecting it means risking even less in future rounds. It's better to take a smaller loss now than potentially a much larger one later."
