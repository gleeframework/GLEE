"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""alice_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than 60-40.  Let's try 65-35.  This gives you a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation in later rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to negotiate, but 65-35 is too far from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher percentage, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. 420,000 is still a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
