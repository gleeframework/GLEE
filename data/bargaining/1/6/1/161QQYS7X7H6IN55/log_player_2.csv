Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see your point about the inflation. I'm willing to be more reasonable, but I also need to be fair to myself. Let's split it 60/40. I'll take the smaller share, but this way we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further inflation hitting our gains.

# Alice gain: 400000
