"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, knowing that inflation will hurt Bob more than me if we go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  Inflation will continue to shrink my potential gains in the next round, making this offer more appealing."
