"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take more this time! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is still worth the same as before, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less.

I'm not too keen on giving up 20$ more than in the first round. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're taking too much! I'll offer 45 for me and 55 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You took too much last round, now it's your turn to give a bit back!""
}
```

I'm sticking to my previous proposal, hoping Bob will reconsider and accept this offer."
