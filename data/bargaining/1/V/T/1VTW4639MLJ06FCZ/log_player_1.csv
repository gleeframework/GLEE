"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, but not too much, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations due to inflation.

Considering the new values, I'd rather not accept an offer that leaves me with a smaller share of the already reduced value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is biting, and I need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal""
}
```"
