"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal, Alice. How about this slightly adjusted offer? We can still settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. This is my counter-offer.  Let's settle this now and both get something."" 
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to resolve this. Don't let inflation eat away at our potential gains! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is finally offering a more reasonable deal under the pressure of inflation. While I could push for a slightly higher amount in the next round, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and further inflation will only hurt him more, potentially making him less likely to accept a deal favorable to me. Taking the 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable gain."
