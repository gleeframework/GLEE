Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we both need to compromise, but my inflation rate is still much higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the heat from the inflation, and her offers are getting more reasonable. However, time is on my side as well. Holding out a little longer might force her to make an even better offer, as the value of her share diminishes quickly."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer acknowledges the inflation disparity while still giving us both a reasonable share.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** By now, Alice should be feeling significant pressure.  Her share is losing value rapidly. It's time to push a bit more in my favor. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  While pushing for a better split, the message still aims to portray me as willing to compromise.  This can encourage Alice to accept rather than risk a worse offer later.
* **Time Factor:**  We're past the halfway point. While I'm willing to push a bit further, dragging things out too long carries its own risks.  This offer aims to secure a good deal while there's still time to negotiate."
