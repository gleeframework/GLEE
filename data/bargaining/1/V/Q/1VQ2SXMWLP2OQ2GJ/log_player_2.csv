# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but time is working against me more than her.  I need to signal I'm willing to compromise but not be walked all over. Holding out hope for a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds is still the best strategy."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, my offer is getting less generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. Alice is clearly willing to play hardball and let the clock run down. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, guarantees me something, which is better than nothing if we run out of rounds."
