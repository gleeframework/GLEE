"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is $4,000, and I'll take 60%, which is $6,000. I'll attach a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and we should settle on this division to avoid further rounds where the money loses value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for drama! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, Bob's $5,000 is actually worth less than the face value, while my $5,000 is worth the full amount. Since I initially offered Bob $4,000 and he rejected, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, especially since the value of the money doesn't decrease for me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $3,800, which is slightly less than my initial offer, considering he rejected an even split that would have been more favorable to him due to the inflation affecting his share. My message will remind him of the decreasing value of his share to encourage acceptance.

{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you hard, let's settle""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need a better deal than that. Let's split it closer to 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer because, despite his willingness to compromise, the deal is still not favorable to me considering the significant decrease in value for Bob's share due to inflation. Since Bob's $4,500 is actually worth much less than the face value, and my share remains unaffected by inflation, I believe I can negotiate for an even better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll decrease my offer to Bob again, considering the increasing impact of inflation on his share. Since Bob is willing to compromise but hasn't accepted my previous offers, I'll aim to make an offer that is slightly more favorable to me while still appearing reasonable.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Inflation is getting worse for you, accept before it's too late""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $3,500, which is less than my previous offer, and remind him in the message that the longer he waits, the less valuable his share becomes due to inflation, hoping this will prompt him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm still hoping for a fairer split. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, his offer of $4,000 is actually worth much less than the face value. Given that I previously offered him $3,500 and he rejected, and now he's offering me $6,000, which is the same as my initial offer, I believe I have the upper hand in negotiations.

However, since Bob claims this is his final offer, and considering the decreasing value of the money for him, I'll accept this offer to ensure I get a significant share without risking further negotiations that could lead to an impasse and both of us getting nothing.
