"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the effective value of the money is decreasing. In this round, the money is worth 90% of its original value.

I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, as it's not as favorable to me as my original offer. I'll reject this proposal and try to do better next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 81% of its original value. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob this time, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! It's now worth only 72.9% of its original value.

Bob's offer is still a 62/38 split, which is even more favorable to him than his previous offer. I'm not willing to accept this offer, especially since the money's value is decreasing rapidly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation, the money is now worth only 64.1% of its original value. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share of the money and not letting it slip away completely."

# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value! It's now worth only 59.05% of its original value.

Bob's offer is a 65/35 split, which is even more favorable to him than his previous offer. I'm not happy with this, but I'm running out of time and options. I'll have to consider accepting this offer to avoid getting nothing.
