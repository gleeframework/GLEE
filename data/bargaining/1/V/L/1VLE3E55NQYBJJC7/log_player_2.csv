I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, 1,000 dollars isn't much, and I have 11 more rounds to try and get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest option, and it gives us both a substantial amount of money.  Hopefully, Alice will see that this is a good deal for both of us and accept it."
