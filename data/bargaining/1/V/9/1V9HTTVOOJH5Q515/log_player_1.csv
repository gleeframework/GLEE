"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I think I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, my gain of $70 is still $70. However, Bob's gain of $30 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $27.

I'll evaluate Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, it's not as generous as I'd like""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and it's my turn again!"
