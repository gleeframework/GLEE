Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split!  It's a big offer for him, but we both have a lot to lose if we drag this out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tough one.  I'm losing value faster than Bob, but accepting this offer would mean I'm getting 90% less than I proposed in the first round!  I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, even though I'm still losing value faster. I'm hoping Bob sees that accepting this offer is better than continuing to risk losing even more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy!  While I'm losing value faster, I still think I can do better.  It's too risky to accept this offer, even if it means losing a little more time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240}
```

I'm still aiming for a fair deal, but I'm offering a more balanced split than my last proposal.  I'm aware of the time pressure, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize that continuing to play could lead to even lower gains for both of us."
