"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This might seem like a generous offer considering the risk of inflation, but it also gives you a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

This is a fair reflection of the risk of inflation, and I believe it will incentivize us to reach an agreement quickly.""}
