"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message to Bob is that this is a fair starting point, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm making the offer this round. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks a 60-40 split is fairer, but with him getting the larger share this time. That's an interesting twist.

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential future gains.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split, and I rejected it, I'll try to adjust my proposal to be more favorable to myself. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to account for the inflation risk""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money with each round, so let's find a solution that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground. An even split might seem fair, but considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think about the long-term implications.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential future gains.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was an even split, and I rejected it, I'll try to adjust my proposal to be more aggressive. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for an even higher share.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve more given the inflation rate""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split it 60-40 again, with you getting the larger share. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation we've both experienced. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to revert back to a 60-40 split, but with him getting the smaller share this time. Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think about the trade-offs.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential future gains.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually a worse deal for me than my original offer in Round 1, which was also a 60-40 split. Given the inflation, I think I can do better than that.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split, and I rejected it, I'll try to be more aggressive in my next offer. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for an even higher share.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to give you the larger share, but we need to settle on something soon. Let's split it 70-30 this time. It's a compromise that accounts for inflation and gives us both something. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final push for a compromise. A 70-30 split is a significant concession from his part, but considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think about the trade-offs.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential future gains.

However, I notice that the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I'm not sure if he's accounting for the inflation correctly. I'm starting to think that he might be getting a better deal than I am.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 70-30 split, and I rejected it, I'll try to be even more aggressive in my next offer. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for the maximum share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9999,

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We are both losing money quickly, and I'm trying to be reasonable here.  Let's split it 80-20 this time. It's a compromise that takes into account the inflation and allows us both to get something, even if it's not what we initially wanted. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final push for a compromise, but with a significant concession this time. A 80-20 split is a big ask, but considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think about the trade-offs.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential future gains.

However, I notice that the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I'm not sure if he's accounting for the inflation correctly. I'm starting to think that he might be getting a better deal than I am.

But, considering the limited number of rounds left, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 80-20 split, hoping that it's a fair compromise given the circumstances."
