"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Your turn! How about we meet in the middle? This accounts for the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can go a bit lower, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400, ""message"": ""This seems fair considering the time pressure and the inflation working against me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I have the upper hand. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the deal is still heavily in her favor due to the inflation rapidly eroding the value of Bob's potential winnings.  It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if she'll offer a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This is my final offer for a reasonable split.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 6 rounds left, Bob needs to signal that he's serious and a deal needs to be made soon.
* **Inflation:** The value of his share is rapidly decreasing, making each passing round worse for him.
* **Slight Concession:**  Offering 4800 is a slight retreat from his previous 4600 offer, showing some flexibility but still holding onto a decent portion.

By framing this as his ""final offer"", Bob puts pressure on Alice to make a decision and potentially avoid both walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. The inflation is really hurting your end, isn't it? 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Alice clearly senses Bob's desperation and is using it to her advantage.  Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 5 rounds left, and the value for Bob diminishes significantly with each one.
* **Alice's Offer:** While lower than Bob's last offer, it might be the best he can get at this point. Alice is unlikely to go much higher knowing the pressure Bob is under. 

**Decision:**

It's a gamble, but I'd recommend **{""decision"": ""accept""}**.  

**Reasoning:**  

While not ideal, accepting secures Bob something rather than risking getting nothing at all if Alice continues to lowball him. This late in the game, something is better than nothing."
