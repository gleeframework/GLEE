"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. I think this is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but I'll consider it.

Since I'm getting $4,000, that's 40% of the total, and Bob is getting $6,000, which is 60% of the total. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Maybe I can get a better deal next time!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my offer!

Considering the new offer, I'm getting $4,500, which is 45% of the total, and Bob is getting $5,500, which is 55% of the total. I'm not thrilled about the split, but I'm starting to feel like I might not be able to get a better deal.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get. Maybe I can try to negotiate more in the future, but for now, I'll take what I can get.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
