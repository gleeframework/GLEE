"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's always good to try and get more, especially with the knowledge of inflation. Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is more fair, since I'm taking the risk of losing value with inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, Alice's offer is a fair one considering the inflation. It's a good deal for both of us, and it ends the game."
