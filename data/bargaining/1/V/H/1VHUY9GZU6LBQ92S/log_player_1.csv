"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is more fair, since I'm taking the risk of losing value with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less now, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, due to cumulative inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my gain with the risk of further inflation."
