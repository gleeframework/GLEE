"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. This offer keeps in mind the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while we are losing significant value due to inflation. It's better to hold out for a better offer, even if it means increasing the risk of getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Time is money Alice, and we're both losing. This is a fair offer that saves us both from further losses.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a larger share due to the faster inflation I face.
* **Time Pressure:** Emphasizing the time pressure and the shared loss due to inflation might make Alice more receptive to a more equitable split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is already a compromise considering the rapid devaluation. Let's be realistic about the time constraint we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the ""rapid devaluation"" as leverage to keep her offer high, but it also impacts her gains. While my losses are more significant with each round, I need to remain firm. Accepting a low offer now will leave me with significantly less value than waiting for a potentially better deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of the inflation. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  After five rounds of back and forth, a firm stance is necessary.  A 50/50 split is presented as non-negotiable.
* **Appealing to Logic:** The message directly addresses the increasing losses due to inflation, highlighting the negative impact on both players. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""Let's end this,"" the message reinforces the time constraint and encourages Alice to accept the deal before further losses occur."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about a 50/50 split, but that doesn't reflect the initial time pressure advantage I hold. This offer is a compromise, and we need to agree soon! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. While Alice's offer is still far from ideal, rejecting it carries a massive risk. We are now at round 7 out of 12, meaning we're past the halfway point. If I reject this, there's a real chance we might end up with nothing, and even if Alice concedes in later rounds, the inflation will have severely eaten into the value. It's a tough decision, but taking the sure bet now is preferable to risking getting zero in the end."
