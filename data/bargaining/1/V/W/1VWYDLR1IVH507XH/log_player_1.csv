"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share this time.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to flip the script and take the larger share this time.

Considering the effects of inflation, I'll calculate the actual values:

* My gain: $4,000 is worth 90% of $6,000 (due to 10% inflation), which is $5,400.
* Bob's gain: $6,000 is worth 80% of $7,500 (due to 20% inflation), which is $6,000.

Given these values, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like a bit more. How about 55-45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at 55-45.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the continued decline in value, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
