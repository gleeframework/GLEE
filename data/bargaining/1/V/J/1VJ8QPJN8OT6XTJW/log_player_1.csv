Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing to take $90 and leave $10 for Bob.  It's a pretty aggressive opening, but I figure I'll start strong and see if he bites. Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take it! While I'm losing 5% of the value from my potential winnings due to inflation, I'd rather get $50 now than risk getting nothing in later rounds.  Let's call it a day!"
