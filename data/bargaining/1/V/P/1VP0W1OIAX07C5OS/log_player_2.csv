Round 5

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to a 60/40 split. While the value is decreasing, I'm holding out for a better offer knowing time pressure will increase.  It's still better to take a chance on a later round than accept an unfair split now."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop messing around. 50/50 is the only fair way to do this before we both end up with nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The time for games is over. I'm going straight for a 50/50 split to show I'm serious. The significant inflation means we're both losing considerable money with every wasted round.  This is the cleanest and fairest way to end the negotiation quickly."
