"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

Alice's gain: $70 / 0.95 = $73.68
Bob's gain: $30 / 0.9 = $33.33

I'll reject this offer since it's not significantly better than my initial proposal, and I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair and equal split.""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, which I hope Bob will find more acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I still want a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

Alice's gain: $55 / 0.8586 = $64.00
Bob's gain: $45 / 0.7273 = $61.73

I'll accept this offer since it's closer to a 50/50 split and I'm getting closer to my target. Plus, we're running out of time, and I'd rather settle for this than risk getting nothing.
