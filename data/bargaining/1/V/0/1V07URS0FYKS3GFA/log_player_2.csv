"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly since we're starting out. I'm open to discussing if this isn't fair. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counter-proposal in the next round, benefiting from the fact that the money will be worth more to him than it is to Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share of the money now, but let's make a deal that's fair to both of us considering the impact of inflation."" 
}
