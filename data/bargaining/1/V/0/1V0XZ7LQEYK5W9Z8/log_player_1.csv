Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I think we can both agree to be a little more equitable, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me. Accepting a 50/50 split now means I'm losing potential gains I could secure by waiting out the inflation further. Bob is feeling the pressure, and I should be able to get a better deal soon."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5750,
""bob_gain"": 4250,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but we need to be realistic. My offer accounts for the inflation working in my favor. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses for you.""

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is the same deal you offered in round one.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is now willing to accept the deal I offered in Round 1. While I could potentially push for a slightly better deal, the risk of Bob becoming completely frustrated and the dwindling rounds makes this a sensible acceptance point."
