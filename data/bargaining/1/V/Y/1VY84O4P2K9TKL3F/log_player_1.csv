"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. This way, I'll get $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more for my part in this negotiation 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the current value of the amounts.

For me, the $2,000 I would gain is worth 95% of the original $2,000, which is $1,900. For Bob, the $8,000 he would gain is worth 90% of the original $8,000, which is $7,200.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing to give Bob $4,500, which is worth 45% of the current value of the money, and I'll take $5,500, which is worth 55% of the current value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think my part is still more valuable 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the current value of the amounts considering the inflation.

For me, the $3,000 I would gain is worth 85.74% of the original $6,000, which is $5,144.40. For Bob, the $7,000 he would gain is worth 70% of the original $8,000, which is $5,600.

I think this offer is still not in my favor, considering the current value of the money. I'll reject the offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the current value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think I need a bit more to make this deal worthwhile.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing to give Bob $5,800, which is worth 58% of the current value of the money, and I'll take $4,200, which is worth 42% of the current value."
