"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, but I get a little more since the value decreases for me each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to get a better deal. Even though Alice gets a little more, the 4500 is a decent starting point.  I want to see if I can get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly, Alice. We can both get more this way.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I came down a little. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. While I'd love more, the inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round.  4800 is a decent amount, and I'm happy to take it."
