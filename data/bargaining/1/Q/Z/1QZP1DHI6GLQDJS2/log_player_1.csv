"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, Bob's offer seems reasonable. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of 45-55."
