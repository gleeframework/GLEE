"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he'll accept it and let me get the bulk of the money. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my first offer, but I still think I can get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a bigger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 950,000 for myself and 50,000 for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept this since it's still a significant gain for him, and I can avoid further inflation and potential losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, my money is losing value quickly due to inflation, and if I reject this, I risk getting nothing at all. I'm better off taking this deal and securing at least some money."
