,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering we both need to be happy to avoid the effects of inflation. Let's see if we can agree on this.",Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. We are both losing money with each round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and safest option at this point.  Let's end this before we both get nothing.",Bob,4,
