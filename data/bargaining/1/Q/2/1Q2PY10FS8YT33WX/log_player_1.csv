"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a fair split, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me with the same offer!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

My gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $360,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000.

I still don't think this is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's my turn again!

Considering the inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000, and I'll take $550,000. This seems like a reasonable split, considering the decreasing value of money."
