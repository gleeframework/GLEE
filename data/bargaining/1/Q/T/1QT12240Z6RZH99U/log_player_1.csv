Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation factor.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a fair share.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's analyze why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is hitting you hard. While $300,000 might seem somewhat acceptable at face value, it's worth considerably less than that due to the two rounds of inflation. 
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against you. He's making slow concessions, hoping you'll panic and accept a low offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  You still have 8 rounds. While time is a factor, a rushed decision now will severely hurt your potential gain. 

**It's time to push back harder against Bob's offers.**"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, or I'm playing hardball from here on out. The clock is ticking for both of us.""
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Shift:** This offer signals a change in your approach. You're no longer trying to be overly fair; you're demonstrating you're willing to take a tougher stance.
* **Time Pressure:**  By emphasizing the limited rounds left, you remind Bob that his stalling tactics could backfire.
* **Future Leverage:** This offer, while slightly favoring Bob, sets a baseline for future negotiations. Accepting anything significantly lower than this from Bob would be a major loss for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This is my final offer. Take it or we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Tactic:**  This is a classic ultimatum, trying to scare you into accepting a low offer with the threat of getting nothing.
* **Inflation's Toll:** That $200,000 is worth significantly less than it appears due to inflation. Accepting means settling for a tiny fraction of what you could have earned. 
* **Rounds Remaining:** You still have 6 rounds! While time is short, it's not gone. Calling Bob's bluff might be risky, but it could also force him to negotiate more realistically.

I'm inclined to reject.  While risky, letting Bob think you'll cave to pressure means he'll likely keep lowballing you. 

**Decision:** {""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This late in the game, you need to show Bob you're serious about getting a fair share. Rejecting might get him to propose a better offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm serious.  Stop trying to lowball me.  This is my last offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Stance:**  You're matching Bob's ultimatum with one of your own. This signals that you won't be intimidated and are prepared to walk away.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While still favoring Bob, this offer is a significant jump from your previous one. It might be enough to get him to seriously consider a deal.
* **Time Factor:** By framing it as your ""last offer,"" you increase the pressure on Bob.  He knows that if he rejects this, you'll likely play hardball in the remaining rounds, putting his potential gain at risk."
