"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I propose to keep $95 and give Bob $5. This is a good starting point, and I'm confident that he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $90 for me and $10 for Bob. Since he rejected my first offer, I'm trying to find a balance between a fair deal and ensuring I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's better than what he offered in the previous round, it's still significantly less than what I want, and the inflation is starting to become a factor. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm lowering my offer further to $85 for me and $15 for Bob. With each round, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to find a balance between a fair deal and maximizing my share before the inflation makes it too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it is better than his previous offer, I'm still losing significant value due to inflation. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm making a final push to secure a reasonable share. With the inflation increasing, I'm willing to offer Bob $20 to ensure I get a larger portion of the remaining money. I need to secure a deal before the inflation eats away at my potential gains further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it is better than his previous offer, I'm losing significant value due to inflation. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's time to try a different strategy, maybe Bob is just trying to push me into a corner."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to try a different strategy. This time, I'm going to propose an equal split. With the inflation continuing to rise, I believe this is the only way to secure a fair deal. I'm hoping Bob will see that the value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and that splitting the money equally is the best option for both of us."
