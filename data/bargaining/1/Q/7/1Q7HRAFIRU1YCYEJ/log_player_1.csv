"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of 50$ is actually 50 * 0.95 = 47.5$. 

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I think I can do better than a 50:50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, my gain of 60$ in this round would be 60 * 0.95 = 57$. 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to give away all the value""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, giving Bob a slightly better deal than before. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight lead, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of 40$ in this round would be 40 * 0.8554 = 34.22$.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 60:40 split, especially since the value of the money has decreased so much. I think I can still get a better deal than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of 45$ in this round would be 45 * 0.8554 = 38.45$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I'm not giving up much more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42:58 split, which is closer to Bob's previous offer, but still gives me a slight edge. Let's see if he'll accept!"
