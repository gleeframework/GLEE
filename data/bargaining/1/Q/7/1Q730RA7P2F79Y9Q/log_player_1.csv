"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of the money now, but I'll let you keep a small portion. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $20 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $21.60.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept his offer.
