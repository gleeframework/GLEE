"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see what you think!""
}
```

This offer gives me $60 and Bob $40, a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm still being cautious. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 70-30 split, especially considering I'm losing more value due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm trying to take into account the fact that I'm losing more value due to inflation, and I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still trying to get a decent share. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with even lower values. I'll take what I can get!"
