{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your initial offer was a bit skewed in your favor, especially considering the inflation. Let's be fairer this round. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'm willing to go down to a 48/52 split in your favor, acknowledging your inflation loss. This feels fairer to both of us.  Let's finalize this before the value keeps decreasing. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48
