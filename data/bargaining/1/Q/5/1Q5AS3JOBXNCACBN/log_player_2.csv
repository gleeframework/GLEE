"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40.  It's important to settle this quickly as the value decreases over time, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer wasn't unfair considering the inflation, but let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This round is our best chance to make a deal where we both benefit significantly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share. However, time is working against you. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a chance for you to secure a reasonable amount before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice is clearly aiming for a 55/45 split in her favor. Given the inflation working against me, waiting another round will likely result in an even worse offer. It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting a much smaller amount later.
