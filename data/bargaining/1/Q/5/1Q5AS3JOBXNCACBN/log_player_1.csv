Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer wasn't unfair considering the inflation, but let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This round is our best chance to make a deal where we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
