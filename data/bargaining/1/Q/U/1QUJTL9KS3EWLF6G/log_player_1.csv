"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 1\nI'll start by offering a division that seems relatively fair but slightly in my favor, as is common in negotiation strategies like the Ultimatum Game. This approach tests Bob's willingness to accept a less favorable offer early on, while still being somewhat reasonable to avoid an immediate rejection.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\nBob has made a very fair offer with a 50/50 split, which is the most equitable division possible. Given the nature of the game and the fact that we have multiple rounds, accepting this offer early on ensures both of us walk away with a decent amount, and there's no guarantee I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. Plus, pushing for more could risk both of us ending up with nothing if we can't agree within the 12 rounds. Thus, accepting this offer seems like the best strategic move.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Game over! We've reached a mutually agreeable division in just two rounds."
