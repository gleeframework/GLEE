"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I figure I can take most of the money, knowing Bob has to accept this round or risk getting even less later!  Let's see if he's greedy enough to take the risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, I have to be realistic. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round. 500,000 is a pretty good chunk of money, and with the inflation, there's a chance I might lose even more if I keep rejecting. Let's take the deal!"
