"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather not take a smaller share than I initially proposed. I'll reject Bob's offer.
