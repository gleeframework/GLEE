Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, but I'm willing to give Bob a small share.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, the inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential gains.  Accepting Bob's offer means we both get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
