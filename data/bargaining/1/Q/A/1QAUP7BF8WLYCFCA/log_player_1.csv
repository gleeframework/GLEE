"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor. This is a generous offer, considering I have to deal with inflation, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, it's still a significant loss for me compared to my initial offer. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself, especially with the knowledge that the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to lower my demand slightly to 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob. While I'm still prioritizing getting the most out of this deal for myself, I'm recognizing that we both need to compromise to reach an agreement.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers, I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering the inflation rate is hitting Bob harder than me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 700,000 - 300,000 split.  It's a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm still aiming to secure a majority share.  It's clear Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not willing to let him completely control the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While the inflation is hurting me, I still believe I can secure a better deal than this. Bob's offer is basically mirroring my previous offer, and I don't see the need to give in to his tactics.  I'm still confident we can reach an agreement where we both gain something significant."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 600,000 - 400,000 split. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm aiming for a deal that's fair considering the inflation and the fact that we're approaching the midpoint of the game. We need to reach an agreement quickly, or both of us will lose out significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While the inflation is making this a tough decision, I still believe I can get a better deal.  The time pressure is mounting, but I'm not ready to settle for a 400,000 - 600,000 split. I'm going to try and push for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing a 500,000 - 500,000 split. This is a drastic change from my previous offer but reflects the dwindling value of the money and the increasing risk of ending up with nothing. I believe this is the fairest solution considering the circumstances, and hopefully, Bob will see it the same way."
