"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's play on! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount. Bob is offering me $400,000, which is 40% of the original $1,000,000.

I'm not sure if I want to take a smaller share, but I also don't want to give up too much. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each round), I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to give up too much""

This way, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not sure if I want to accept a 45/55 split. Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: $450,000
* Bob's gain: $550,000

These amounts are still worth 14.26% less than the original $1,000,000. I'm not sure if I want to settle for this, especially since I was aiming for a higher share earlier.

I'll reject this offer for now.

These amounts are still worth 30.17% less than the original $1,000,000. I'm not sure if I want to settle for this, especially since I was aiming for a higher share earlier.

However, I also need to consider that we're getting close to the 12-round limit, and I might not get a better offer. I'll think carefully before making a decision.
