Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much. How about 55/45? It's still closer to an even split, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
