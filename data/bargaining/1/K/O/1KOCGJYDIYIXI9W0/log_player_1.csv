Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split in my favor is a fair starting point, since the money is worth 5% less to me each round.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51
