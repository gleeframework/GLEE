Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small amount to ensure he accepts, hoping for a better outcome in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's a far cry from my initial offer, accepting this offer is the best option for me. With each round, my portion of the money decreases due to inflation. Taking 100,000 now is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
