"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Bob's offer is similar to the one I made in round 3, but with a slight adjustment. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money Bob gains, which is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to another round. I'll accept his offer.
