"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  This is a good starting point to see how Bob values the money and if he's willing to risk inflation to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer my initial proposal, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Bob's counter-offer is a significant shift from his initial rejection, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  Furthermore, the risk of inflation makes it unwise to continue this game for longer. It's unlikely I can get a better deal, and even if I could, the inflation could eat away at any potential gains."
