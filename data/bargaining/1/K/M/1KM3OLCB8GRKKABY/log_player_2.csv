Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair start. I'm willing to share most of the money, but we need to find a way to make sure we both get something! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept this offer, the game is designed to incentivize negotiation. There's a good chance Alice will offer you a better deal in the next round, especially since she'll be taking a bigger hit from the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point. It's fair and allows us to both get a substantial portion of the money. Let's work together to get a deal before the inflation hits too hard!""}
