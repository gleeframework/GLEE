"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even after accounting for inflation. I'm confident that I can do better, and I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more aggressive offer, aiming for a larger share while still leaving Bob with something. I'm hoping he recognizes the value of getting something rather than potentially getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my initial proposal, even after considering inflation. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round to try and secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still aim for a larger share.  I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating, and he'll be more inclined to accept a deal before the inflation hits us both too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer from Bob is becoming increasingly attractive. While it's significantly lower than my ideal, the inflation is starting to bite hard, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers.  This offer gives me a decent amount, and it's a more secure outcome than potentially getting nothing."
