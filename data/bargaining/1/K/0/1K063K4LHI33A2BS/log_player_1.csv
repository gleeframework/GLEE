Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I would prefer a slightly higher share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in later rounds is very risky. Bob might not budge, and we risk getting nothing at all.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and Bob is unlikely to offer anything better as the game progresses."
