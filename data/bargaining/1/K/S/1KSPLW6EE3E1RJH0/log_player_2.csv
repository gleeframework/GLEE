Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, I'm being reasonable, and you're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **Time pressure:**  We're past the halfway point.  Alice knows the clock is working against me.
* **Inflation:** That 43 is worth significantly less than it was in Round 1.
* **Alice's pattern:** She's consistently aiming for a larger share but has made small concessions. 

I have to make a decision, and it's risky either way. I think I have to gamble that she's more afraid of getting $0 than she is of getting a slightly smaller share.
