"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair share considering the game's inflation mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no games 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than splitting it down the middle. If I accept this offer, I'll get $5,000, which is less than my initial offer of $8,000. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a little greedy, Bob! Meet me in the middle, and I'll give you a small bonus.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm trying to make it sound appealing by throwing in a ""small bonus"" phrase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not serious about splitting it fairly, are you? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm still not getting a good deal. If I accept this offer, I'll get $6,000, which is still less than my initial offer of $8,000. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, considering the decreasing value of Bob's offer due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, Bob. Meet me at 95% and you can have the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small amount, but I'm trying to make it sound like I'm being generous by giving him a larger percentage of the remaining amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not desperate yet, but I'm getting there... 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not getting a good deal. If I accept this offer, I'll get $7,000, which is still less than my initial offer of $8,000. Considering the significant inflation that's reducing the value of Bob's offer, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9800,
  ""bob_gain"": 200,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small amount, but I'm trying to make it sound like I'm being generous by giving him a tiny fraction of the remaining amount. I'm hoping he'll take it, but I'm not counting on it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice. Meet me in the middle, and we can finally end this 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because I think I've been playing hardball for too long, and it's time to end the game. While I was initially hoping to get more, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round, considering the rapid inflation. Meeting Bob in the middle at $7,500 for me seems like a reasonable compromise."
