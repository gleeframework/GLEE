"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering I'll be making the next offer if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,800 in this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $4,000, which is still a decent amount, but I'm not sure it's fair given the inflation factor. I'd rather wait for the next round to see if I can negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my potential gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so my offer will be adjusted accordingly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,500, and I'll take the remaining $4,500. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation factor."
