"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% upfront. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a fair split right now, I know that the money will be worth less to Alice in the next round. I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this round, but I'm willing to share the wealth. Let's work together to get the most out of this deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need a better deal to agree. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a good deal for me, especially considering inflation is working against her. I'll take the 45% and end the game."
