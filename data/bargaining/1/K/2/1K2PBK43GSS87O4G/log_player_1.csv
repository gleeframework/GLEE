"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you have to think carefully, because the money is worth less with each round! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the previous round, which is 0.95 \* 600,000 = 570,000.

Bob's gain of 700,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the previous round, which is 0.9 \* 400,000 = 360,000.

This offer is quite unfavorable to me, as I'm getting less than half of the original amount. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time, but I'm still hoping for a fair deal""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a majority of the original amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values of the gains considering the inflation:

My gain of 450,000 is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is 0.8574 \* 600,000 = 510,840.

Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, which is 0.729 \* 400,000 = 291,600.

This offer is still unfavorable to me, as I'm getting less than 50% of the original amount. I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 50-50 split seems fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise."
