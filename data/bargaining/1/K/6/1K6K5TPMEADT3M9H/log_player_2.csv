Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to 6000, but I'm not going lower. We need to finish this before inflation eats away at our gains.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 5500, and you get 4500. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer in round 5 is the best I'm likely to get at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of my share is decreasing rapidly. Every round that passes makes a significant dent in my potential gains.
* **Alice's Stance:** She seems firm on not going lower than 5500. Holding out hope for a better deal in later rounds is risky.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 8 rounds left, the pressure is on. A bad deal now is better than no deal at the end. 

It's a compromise, but given the circumstances, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most logical choice."
