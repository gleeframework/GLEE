"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share to get something quickly.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. I'm willing to wait one more round and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, taking into account the inflation that has happened since the last round.  I believe this is a fair offer that Bob should consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, I'm accepting this offer.  It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
