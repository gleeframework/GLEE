"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a fair and straightforward proposal. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, I'm willing to make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly weighted deal, where I'll get $5,500 and you'll get $4,500. This way, I'm trying to get a bit more, but still leave some room for compromise. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to my minimum, but I'll give you a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a big bite out of our potential earnings! With the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about accepting a smaller share.

However, considering the current state of the economy, I think I'll have to swallow my pride and accept this offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
