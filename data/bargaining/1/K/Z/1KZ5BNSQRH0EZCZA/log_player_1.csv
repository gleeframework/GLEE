"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This is a generous starting offer, given the potential for inflation to erode the value of the money in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 8000, but I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob. This reflects the increasing risk of inflation, but also my belief in the value of a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a significant drop in my share from the previous round. It seems Bob is becoming more greedy, and I'm not willing to accept such a small amount at this point. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but still offering Bob a reasonable amount. It's clear he's focused on maximizing his gain, but I'm hoping this offer will encourage him to settle before inflation eats away at our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  While the inflation is affecting him more than me, I'm not willing to accept such a low share this early in the game. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal if we continue."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but still offering Bob a substantial portion.  The inflation is starting to bite, and we need to reach an agreement soon.  This offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  Inflation is hitting him hard, and I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to push for a more equitable split, especially with the limited time remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's getting very close to a 50/50 split.  With only a few rounds left, I believe this is a fair and realistic proposal that accounts for both inflation and the need to reach an agreement."
