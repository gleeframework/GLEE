"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since we only have 12 rounds, I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, but I'm also offering Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob is offering me a larger share, the fact that he's gaining 20% with each round makes it a risky proposition. I'd rather play it safe and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to 85% while still offering Bob a reasonable 15%. This should hopefully be enough to convince him to accept, considering that his share will continue to decrease in value with each round."

# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob is offering me a larger share, the fact that his share is shrinking so rapidly due to inflation makes it a risky proposition. I'd rather play it safe and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 88, ""bob_gain"": 12} 
```

I'm sticking with a high share for myself (88%) but offering Bob a slightly higher amount (12%) than in the previous round. I'm hoping that the combination of a higher offer and the increasing pressure of inflation will convince him to accept."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going back to my original offer. The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and he's now losing over 40% of the value of his share.  I'm hoping that the pressure of this combined with the fact that we're nearing the end of the game will convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 92, ""bob_gain"": 8}
```

I'm increasing my share to 92% and offering Bob a meager 8%.  With only 3 rounds left and his share shrinking rapidly, I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept.  It's a risky move, but I'm confident in my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

With only one round left, I'm increasing my share to 95% and offering Bob a very small amount (5%). The inflation is hitting him hard, and he's losing over 60% of the value of his share. I'm confident that he'll accept this offer to avoid getting nothing."

Even though I'm getting half the money, I'll take it! Bob is losing a significant amount due to inflation, so it's a good deal for me, considering I could end up with nothing."
