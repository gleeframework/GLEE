"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm betting Bob will accept this offer in the first round, as there's no way to know how the inflation will affect him.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though the money I gain is worth the same, the inflation effect on Bob means his 90$ is worth less than it was in the first round.  This gives me leverage for the next round. I'll propose a split more favorable to myself, taking advantage of the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm taking advantage of the inflation factor.  Bob's offer was significantly worse than my first offer, so I'm raising the stakes again. I'm betting he'll be more willing to accept something closer to my initial proposal, given the decreasing value of his potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable.  Although his offer is slightly better than the previous round, the inflation on his end is increasing, making his offer worth even less. This gives me more leverage in the next round. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm pushing my luck again. Bob's offer is still unfavorable, and the inflation on his end is increasing.  This gives me a good chance of getting a larger share of the money. I'm offering him a small increase from my last proposal, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite unfavorable.  While his offer is slightly better than the previous round, the inflation effect on his end is significant, meaning his 70$ is worth considerably less than it was in the beginning. This is a clear sign that he's starting to feel the pressure from inflation, and it gives me more leverage for the next round. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm raising the stakes again. Bob's offers have been consistently unfavorable, and the inflation is clearly hitting him hard. He's offering me a smaller and smaller portion of the money, which is becoming less valuable for him.  This round, I'm offering him a slightly higher share than before, hoping to tempt him into accepting before his offers become even more unfavorable."
