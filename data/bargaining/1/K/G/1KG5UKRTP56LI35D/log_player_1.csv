Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better.  I'm willing to share more of the money with you, but I need to account for the faster rate at which my share loses value. Let's find a solution that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
