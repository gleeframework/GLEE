"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split, with me receiving $55 and Bob receiving $45. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 55-45 split in his favor. It's not more reasonable for me to receive less than half of the money, especially since the money is worth the same to me as it was in the first round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer and it's now my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""My turn again! Considering inflation, I think this is a better split.""}\n\nI'm offering a new split of 60-40 in my favor, considering that the money is still worth the same to me but 5% less to Bob each round. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is fair and we both lose money by delaying. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Given that the money is still worth the same to me but is decreasing in value for Bob with each round, this seems like a reasonable compromise. It's also true that delaying further could result in more loss for Bob, so it's a good time to conclude the game.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've accepted his offer!"
