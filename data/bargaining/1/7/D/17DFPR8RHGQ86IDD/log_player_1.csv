"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll start by offering Bob a small portion. I figure I can get a better deal later on as the money loses value for him faster than for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than my previous offer, the inflation rate makes it still unfavorable. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to 700,000 for myself, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. I'm aware inflation is hurting him more, but I'm still trying to get a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than what I hoped for initially, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for me. Accepting this offer will ensure I get at least something, which is better than risking getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
