I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  While I want the majority of the money, I recognize that starting with a fair but not overly generous offer is important to get the negotiation going.  We have a lot of rounds left, so it's important to maintain a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While he is offering me a larger share of the money than I offered him, it is still only $100,000. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, this offer is actually worth less to me than his previous offer was worth to him. I believe that I can do better by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $200,000 this round.  While the inflation hurts, I still believe I can secure a larger share of the money. By offering a somewhat generous amount to Bob, I hope to avoid further rejections and move towards a compromise in the future.  This offer is also a smaller increase from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my desire to get a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. The inflation is hitting hard, and while I'm not happy with this split, I'm worried that if I keep rejecting offers, I'll end up with nothing at all. This offer, while not ideal, is a decent amount of money, and I'm not sure I can get more given how quickly the value of money is declining.  It's time to cut my losses and secure something before the inflation gets even worse."
