"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me, and my gain is worth 5% less than the original $100.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 40, but it's better than nothing. I'll have to think carefully...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than the original $100. I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but don't expect me to go any higher!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I think I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not thrilled about getting only 42, but it's getting harder to say no. The value of my gain is now significantly lower than the original $100.
