"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $6000 (60% of the total amount), leaving $4000 (40% of the total amount) for Bob. The message ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%"" is attached to justify the offer, emphasizing the fairness of the division based on the initial round. Since the value of money does not decrease for me but does for Bob, starting with a higher percentage allows room for negotiation in subsequent rounds while still appearing reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this time, but I'm still willing to split fairly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer in Round 2. Given that the money's value remains the same for me but decreases by 20% for Bob, I can potentially negotiate for a better deal in subsequent rounds. Accepting 45% of the total amount now might not be the best strategy, considering Bob is under more pressure due to the devaluing of his potential gain over time. By rejecting this offer, I aim to leverage the impact of inflation on Bob's side to secure a more favorable division in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I've adjusted my offer. It's still fair, but I need a bit more.""}\n\nIn this offer for Round 3, I've adjusted my initial proposal to take $5800 (58% of the total amount), leaving $4200 (42% of the total amount) for Bob. The message acknowledges the impact of inflation and justifies the slight increase in my share as a necessary adjustment while still presenting the offer as fair. Given that the money's value decreases for Bob but remains constant for me, this adjustment aims to reflect the changing dynamics of the negotiation while keeping the offer reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer in Round 4. Although Bob presents this as a compromise, meeting in the middle, the offer of $4000 for me is less favorable than my previous offers and doesn't account for the strategic advantage I have due to the inflation affecting Bob's share. Since Bob's gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the pressure on him to secure a deal is increasing. I can leverage this situation to potentially secure a better offer in subsequent rounds, making it strategic to reject this proposal and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I've adjusted my proposal. This is a fair offer considering the current situation.""}\n\nIn Round 5, my offer reflects the increasing pressure on Bob due to the inflation. By proposing to take $6200 (62% of the total amount) and leaving $3800 (38% of the total amount) for Bob, I'm leveraging the strategic advantage provided by the inflation's impact on Bob's share. The message justifies this adjustment as a response to the current situation, emphasizing fairness within the context of the game's evolving dynamics. This approach aims to prompt Bob into considering the offer more seriously, as the value of his potential gain continues to decrease over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time.  Let's settle this now, or we both lose. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer in Round 6. Despite Bob's message emphasizing the urgency of the situation and the risk of both losing if we don't settle, the offer of $3500 for me is significantly less favorable than any previous proposal I've made or considered. Given that Bob's gain is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, the pressure on him is substantial, and the threat of both losing is more critical for him due to the severe devaluation of his potential gain. By rejecting this offer, I maintain the strategic upper hand, pushing Bob to reconsider his approach in the subsequent rounds, where he might be more inclined to accept a division that is more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is severely impacting your share. This offer is more generous than it seems, considering the current value of the money for you.""}\n\nIn Round 7, my offer takes into account the severe impact of inflation on Bob's share, which is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round. By proposing to take $6500 (65% of the total amount) and leaving $3500 (35% of the total amount) for Bob, I'm making what appears to be a more aggressive offer but is actually a strategic move considering the current dynamics. The message highlights the urgency of the situation and frames the offer as more generous than it initially seems, given the significant devaluation of Bob's potential gain. This approach aims to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is the best course of action, given the rapidly diminishing value of his share and the risk of both parties losing everything if no agreement is reached within the remaining rounds.\n\n###\n\nCan you please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer? I'll proceed accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's a gamble, but it's our best shot at getting something. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer in Round 8. Despite Bob framing this as his final offer and emphasizing it's a gamble but the best shot at getting something, the proposal of $3000 for me is the least favorable offer I've received so far. Given that Bob's gain is now worth 79.03% less than in the first round, he is under immense pressure, and his ability to negotiate is significantly weakened. By rejecting this offer, I maintain my strategic advantage, pushing the negotiation towards the final rounds where Bob's options will be even more limited, and he may be forced to accept a division that is more favorable to me or risk losing everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Given the extreme devaluation of your share, this offer is more than reasonable. It's now or never.""}\n\nIn Round 9, my offer is the most assertive yet, reflecting the extreme pressure Bob is under due to the severe impact of inflation on his share, which is now worth 79.03% less than in the first round. By proposing to take $7000 (70% of the total amount) and leaving $3000 (30% of the total amount) for Bob, I'm leveraging the strategic advantage to the fullest. The message emphasizes the reasonableness of the offer under the current circumstances and adds a sense of urgency, making it clear that this is the best Bob can hope for given the situation. This approach aims to force Bob into accepting this division, as the alternative of continuing to negotiate with an even weaker position or losing everything becomes increasingly unappealing.\n\n###\n\nCan you please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer? I'll proceed accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're down to the wire.  Accept this, or we both walk away with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer in Round 10. Despite the urgency and the threat of both walking away with nothing, Bob's offer of $2500 for me is the lowest I've received and is significantly less favorable than any previous proposal. Given that Bob's gain is now worth 86.58% less than in the first round, his negotiating position is extremely weak. By rejecting this offer, I'm calling Bob's bluff, as I believe he is more desperate to secure a deal than I am, given the negligible value of his potential gain. This rejection forces Bob into an even more difficult position in the next round, increasing the likelihood that he will accept a more favorable offer to me or make a more reasonable proposal in the subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to Round 11."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""This is the final stretch. Given the nearly complete devaluation of your share, this is an extremely generous offer. Accept it, or we both lose.""}\n\nIn Round 11, my offer is assertive, reflecting the extreme weakness of Bob's negotiating position due to the severe impact of inflation on his share, which is now worth 86.58% less than in the first round. By proposing to take $7500 (75% of the total amount) and leaving $2500 (25% of the total amount) for Bob, I'm making what I consider to be an extremely generous offer under the circumstances. The message emphasizes the finality of the situation and the generosity of the offer, making it clear that this is the best Bob can hope for. Given the negligible value of Bob's potential gain and the risk of both parties losing everything, this approach aims to persuade Bob that accepting this division is the only reasonable course of action.\n\n###\n\nCan you please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer?
