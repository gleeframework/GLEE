# Alice gain: 580000

I'm still hoping for a better deal, especially with the inflation affecting my gains more significantly.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer. I'll adjust my offer again, but I need a bit more. 57-43 is my new proposal. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I still think a 60-40 split is fairer, I'm not sure how many more rounds I can afford to reject.  Inflation is really hitting me hard. I'll take Alice's offer for now and see how the rest of the game plays out."
