"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to consider that in my decision. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4000, which is worth 80% of the original $5000 I was hoping for in the first round.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money by 20% in the first round and another 10% in the second round, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a larger share, but I'm willing to take a risk to get a bigger portion of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $5800, which is worth only 58% of the original $10,000.

However, I'm not sure what the inflation rate is for Bob, so I'll have to consider the possibility that he might be getting a better deal.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The game is getting intense!

Considering the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get an even larger share this time to compensate for the inflation. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll try to get a bigger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid further negotiations and the potential for even more inflation."

However, I'm not sure what the inflation rate is for Bob, so I'll have to consider the possibility that he might be getting a better deal.

Given the significant reduction in value, I'll decide to...
