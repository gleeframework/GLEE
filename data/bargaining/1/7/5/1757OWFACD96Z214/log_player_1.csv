"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can get a smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the significant disparity in our gains. However, I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to take the lead!

Considering the inflation, I'll propose a slightly smaller share for myself, but still a decent one:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Your turn to negotiate, Bob! I'm being generous, but I'm not giving away all the cash""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take most of it now 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the tiny share I'd get, and the fact that Bob is trying to take most of the remaining money. I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less.

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to squeeze a bit more:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting desperate!

Considering the massive inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a bigger share. I'll propose a larger share for myself, but it's a risk:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger""
}
```"
