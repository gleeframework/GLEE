Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! Let's split the million evenly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, Alice. I'm offering you a smaller share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll have to consider the inflation factor, as my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
