Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We need to close this deal now.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than Bob, and her offers are getting increasingly desperate. While this offer is better than her round 3 offer,  Bob is still in a strong position to push for a better deal.  With 7 rounds remaining, there's room to negotiate further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this negotiation. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses from inflation.  This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

By round 6, it's crucial to recognize that Alice is feeling more and more pressure. However, pushing for a significantly larger share for Bob might backfire. A 50/50 split is a strong offer for several reasons:

* **Fairness:** It's objectively fair, which can appeal to Alice even in her stressed state.
* **Simplicity:** It ends the negotiation cleanly, removing further complications and potential for conflict.
* **Finality:**  By stating it's Bob's final offer, it puts the pressure back on Alice to accept a reasonable deal before inflation erodes the value further. 

This approach balances firmness with a reasonable proposal, maximizing the chances of reaching an agreement."
