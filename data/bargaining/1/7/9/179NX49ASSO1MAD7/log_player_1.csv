"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further in future rounds""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer given that I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, so I'm matching it. Next round will be interesting! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Given that the money is worth 20% less for me now, and Bob's offer is a 50:50 split, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now, as I'm hoping to do better in the next round. My offer was a fair split, and I'm not sure I want to give up the potential for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less again, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still looking for a fair split, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust my offer to account for the inflation, while still aiming for a slightly more favorable split for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance, but still willing to compromise. Your turn to meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less for me now, my gain is significantly reduced.

However, I notice that Bob is now offering a 40:60 split, which is a more favorable split for him than my previous offer. Given that I'm trying to maximize my gain, I'll accept this offer.
