"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share, but you get something to start. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While I get a little something, it's nowhere near a fair split. I'm banking on getting a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering a more than fair split considering the inflation. Do you really want to risk it?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the only way we both get something worthwhile after inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. With inflation eating away at my share, waiting any longer will only hurt me more. A 50/50 split is the best I can hope for at this point."
