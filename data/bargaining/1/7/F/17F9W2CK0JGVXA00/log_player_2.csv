Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. It's a fair offer considering the time constraint. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting her more than me, so I can afford to gamble on another round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer and we both walk away with something substantial. Time is running out for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** By round 4, the shrinking pot and dwindling time are putting pressure on both players. 
* **Slight Edge:** Offering 55/45 gives Bob a slight edge while still being attractive enough (hopefully) for Alice to consider seriously.
* **Ultimatum Tone:**  The message aims to inject a sense of urgency and finality to push Alice towards accepting."
