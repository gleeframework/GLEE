I'm going to try to get as much as possible in the first round, as the inflation will hurt me more. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

It's in my best interest to accept this offer.  While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, the inflation rate is going to make future rounds even worse for me.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the money, even with the inflation."
