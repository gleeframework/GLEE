"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $400,000 and kept $600,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's divide fairly"". Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept the offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a slightly larger share but still leave you with a fair amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, I will evaluate the offer based on its face value. Considering Bob's offer gives me $450,000, which is less than the $600,000 I initially offered myself but still a significant amount, I have to weigh the pros and cons. Given that rejecting this offer would lead to another round where the money's value remains the same for me but decreases further for Bob, I might have leverage to get a better deal in the next round. However, there's also the risk that Bob might offer something worse if we continue.\n\n###\n\nConsidering these factors, my decision is to reject the offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for Bob. Since he is more pressured to reach a deal due to the 10% decrease in value each round, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer to myself while still being reasonable.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering the circumstances, this is a generous offer.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but this needs to be fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the current situation, where Bob is experiencing a significant decrease in the value of his potential gain due to inflation, his willingness to compromise is expected. The offer of $580,000 for me is closer to my initial proposal and more in line with what I consider fair, especially since the value of the money remains unchanged for me.\n\n###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money for Bob and the risk that further rounds might lead to less favorable offers from him due to desperation, I believe this offer strikes a reasonable balance. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount without the uncertainty of future negotiations.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the agreement."
