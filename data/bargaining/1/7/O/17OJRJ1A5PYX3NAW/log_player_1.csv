"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'll be the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the options. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation is still affecting my potential gain, I'll aim for a more favorable split. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep some buffer!""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain slightly, but still trying to maintain a slight edge. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the high road, but you're getting low! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that the game will end soon and I can get some real value out of the $4000."
