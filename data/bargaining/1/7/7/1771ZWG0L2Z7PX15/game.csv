700000.0,300000.0,Let's split the money with a 7:3 ratio. This offers a fair deal considering the potential inflation.,Alice,1,

200000.0,800000.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the initial offer was 7:3. I'm willing to give you a 1:5 ratio, but I think this is a better deal for both of us.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,I've adjusted my proposal to a 3:2 ratio. I believe this is a fairer distribution considering the inflation and our previous offers.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to compromise again, considering the effects of inflation. I think a 3:2 ratio is a bit too generous for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. This 9:1 ratio is a better reflection of the current value of the money, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",Bob,4,
