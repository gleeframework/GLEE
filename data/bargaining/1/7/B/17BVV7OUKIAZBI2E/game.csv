900000.0,100000.0,Let's split the money fairly. I'm offering you 10% and keeping 90% for myself.  This is a good starting point for a fair division.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite bold. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Consider that the value of the money decreases over time for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I think your offer is still too far off from a fair split. I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle, with a 55/45 split in my favor.  This would still be beneficial for both of us, considering the inflation.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. I'm offering a 52/48 split in my favor. This acknowledges the decreasing value of the money and offers a reasonable advantage considering I'm taking on more risk with each passing round.",Bob,4,
