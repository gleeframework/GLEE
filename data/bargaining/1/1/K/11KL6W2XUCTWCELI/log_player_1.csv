"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual value of the $5000 I'd gain in this round is equivalent to $4500 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit. You get 40% this round. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60:40 split, with me getting 60% of the current $10,000."
