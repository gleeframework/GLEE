"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new proposal, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not meet in the middle, as I think I can do better. My current gain of $50 is worth 80% of the original $60 I proposed in the first round, so I'm not feeling too bad about it. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation is still affecting me, I'll try to be a bit more aggressive this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, hoping to get a bit more than the 50-50 split Bob offered in the last round. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting me now!

Considering the new proposal, I'll think for a moment...

I'll accept this offer. My gain of $45 is worth significantly less than my original $60 proposal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate. I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even worse deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
