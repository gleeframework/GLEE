``` 
I'm going to try and get a better deal for myself, as there's still a lot of money on the table and the inflation is going to hurt my potential gains with every round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share remains stable, but yours is decreasing in value. This offer is more generous than it seems. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still going to try for a better deal. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm hoping I can get a higher share before it gets worse."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make up for the inflation.  This offer is still fair, given the current circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is significantly impacting your share. I'm willing to end the game with this offer, considering the current value depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The inflation is really starting to hurt now.  Even though I'm getting less than I'd like, it's better to accept this offer and get something than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
