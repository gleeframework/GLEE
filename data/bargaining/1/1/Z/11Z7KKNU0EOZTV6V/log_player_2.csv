# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is running out, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the money due to inflation. It's worth the risk to hold out for a slightly better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be fair. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution. Take it or leave it.""}

# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting tight, but accepting now would mean losing almost half the value due to inflation.  Alice is clearly trying to pressure me.  I need to hold my nerve a little longer and hope she becomes more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's end this now.  I'm taking a hit with this offer, but it's better than both of us losing everything.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Time is running out, and inflation is eating into my potential gains.  I need to make a compromise to try and salvage something from this negotiation.  A slightly unfavorable split is better than getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'm taking advantage! 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough pill to swallow, but with only three rounds left, the inflation is about to decimate my potential gain.  Alice is clearly exploiting the situation, but taking this offer is better than risking a total loss if she continues to push her advantage."
