"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. You can have 60% and I'll take 40% 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take 60% of the reduced value, which is $6,000, and Bob will take 40%, which is $4,000."
