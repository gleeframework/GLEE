Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking $99 for myself and giving $1 to Bob. This is a very aggressive offer, but since I'm the first to propose, I'm trying to get as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
