"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer gives you a sizable sum now, Bob.  Every round that passes hurts us both due to inflation, but hurts you more than me.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's in my best interest to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not convinced that accepting her offer will lead to the best outcome for me in the long run, especially with the rate of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than Alice's previous offer.  This proposal gives you a good chunk of the money, and I believe we can end this game quickly.  Let's avoid further inflation and get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be realistic.  The value of this money is plummeting fast, especially for you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and a quicker resolution benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, I believe I can still do better. Even with the inflation, the value of the money is still decreasing more rapidly for Alice than it is for me. I'm going to continue to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to make a decision soon. This inflation is hurting us both, but it's hurting you more. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but we can't keep delaying this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous. The longer we wait, the less value we both get.  Take this offer and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still pushing for a better deal.  While the offer is getting closer to what I'd like, I'm not convinced it's the best outcome for me given the circumstances.  I'm hoping that by continuing to reject her offers, I can secure a larger share of the money before the inflation completely erodes its value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  The inflation is hurting us both significantly, but it's hurting you even more.  Let's end this quickly and both walk away with a decent amount of money.""}
