"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering you $9,000 and Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money while still leaving Bob with something. It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair split, and since Bob's money is worth less each round, it's better to accept now than risk getting less in the next round."
