"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting our roles in this game. I'm willing to give you a chance to propose a better split in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This split is closer to 50/50, but I think I deserve a slight edge since I'm making the proposal.""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still relatively close to a 50/50 split."
