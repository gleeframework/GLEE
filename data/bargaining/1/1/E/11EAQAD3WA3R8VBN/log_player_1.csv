Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, and I'm willing to give you a slight advantage since you offered first. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nI've reduced my initial offer to try to find a compromise with Bob, taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money for me. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly.  Inflation is hurting us both, and this seems like the most logical solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of an even split, 50/50. Given that the money is worth 27.1% less to me than in the first round due to inflation, and taking into account that further rounds will only decrease its value further, I believe this is the best deal I can get at this point. It seems like a fair and logical solution, considering the circumstances.\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the agreement!"
