"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm suggesting that we can negotiate further from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split just yet. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair share.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 500, and decreasing Bob's share by 500, in an attempt to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll try to find a middle ground. Your offer was a bit too aggressive, so I'll try to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 52/48 is a good split for me, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to your offer, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his previous offer and my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Let's try to find a 50/50 split again. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Déjà vu!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the 50/50 split. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a fair one, and I don't want to risk going to another round with inflation eating away at the value of the money."
