600000.0,400000.0,I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This ensures a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,

,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I propose an equal split of the money. Given the inflation rates, we should aim for a balanced outcome where neither party significantly loses out on value.",Alice,3,
