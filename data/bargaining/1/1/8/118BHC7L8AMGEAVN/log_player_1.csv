"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll take the smaller share to give you a chance to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. I'm trying to be generous to give Bob an incentive to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up the majority of the money, especially with the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise at 55-45, but I'm not going below 55%.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lion's share, you can't afford to be too greedy 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less for me and even more so for Bob, I'll have to be careful not to give up too much.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50, no more negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle."
