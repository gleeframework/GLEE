}

I'm starting with a fair and simple offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
