"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the first to make a proposal. I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, given the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to make sure we both get a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and balanced proposal. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game on a good note!"
