I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's more than he offered initially, it's still far less than what I'd receive if I were to propose in the next round. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,500, while keeping $8,500 for myself.  I'm still aiming for a favorable outcome, but I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid further rounds and the potential loss of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's significantly less than what I initially hoped for, the inflation is making each round riskier.  A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
