"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us receiving $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split. I'll need a better deal to consider it.""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to make some adjustments!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I still want a bit more. Can you compromise?""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly more generous deal, with me receiving $450,000 and Bob receiving $550,000. Let's see if he's willing to compromise!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my gains! With the money being worth less, I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'm still not thrilled about the 58/42 split. I was hoping for a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to reject the offer entirely.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get:

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""I'll take the deal, but I'm not happy about it. I hope we can do better next time.""}

Let's finalize the deal and split the money!"
