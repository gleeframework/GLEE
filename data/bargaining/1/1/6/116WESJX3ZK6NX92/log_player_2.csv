This is a tough one, and getting close to crunch time, but I still think holding out for a better offer is the right move.  Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the dwindling pot, which means she's more likely to concede further in the next round or two.
* **Previous offers:**  Alice started high and has been slowly coming down. Her offer to ""split the difference"" suggests she's willing to negotiate further.
* **Alternative:** Accepting a 44/56 split means losing a significant chunk of the initial value. It's worth the risk of one more rejection to see if we can secure a better outcome."
