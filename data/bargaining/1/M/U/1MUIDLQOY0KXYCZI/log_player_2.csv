**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit my vulnerability to inflation. I need to hold firm and make it clear that I'm willing to walk away with nothing if she doesn't offer a fairer deal.  The closer we get to the end, the more pressure is on her to make a deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'fair' 50/50 split was a good try, but I'll pass 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. 

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is mounting.  Every round that passes significantly reduces the value of the potential winnings for me.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I hold out hope for a better offer, each round will likely result in smaller and smaller increases from Alice.  It's unlikely she will suddenly jump to a much more favorable split. 
* **Guaranteed Loss if No Agreement:**  If we don't reach an agreement, we both walk away with nothing. Accepting this offer ensures I at least get something. 

While Alice has played a tough game, taking the sure thing now is the most rational decision considering the circumstances."
