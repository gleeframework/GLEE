"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, I'll get the majority""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, offering Bob $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll take 40% and you can take 60% 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since it's a better deal than my previous one, considering the inflation.
