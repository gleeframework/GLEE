"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to keep him motivated to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.95 = 4210.53
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 4500 / 0.8526 = 5265.19
Bob gain: 5500 / 0.8526 = 6438.81

I'll accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise.
