"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in getting something rather than risking going to another round and having the money's value decrease further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll have to consider whether I'm getting a fair deal. Given that the money is worth 10% less for Bob due to inflation, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob now (10% less in the first round and another 10% less in the second round), I'll try to take advantage of this and make a more aggressive offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! Accept this offer before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll be desperate enough to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not desperate yet, Alice. I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is eating away at the money quickly!

Considering the significant decrease in value for Bob's share, I'm starting to think that I should accept this offer. The difference between 700,000 and 800,000 is not that significant, and I don't want to risk going to another round and having the money's value decrease even further.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
