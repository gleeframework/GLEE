Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""This is a reasonable offer given the inflation. I'm willing to be fair, but time is running out.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, let's settle on this! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While my potential gains are decreasing, I need to hold firm to get a reasonable offer. Accepting 43 dollars now is a terrible deal compared to what I could have gotten in earlier rounds.  I need to signal I'm willing to risk it going down to the wire."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is clearly trying to stall and exploit the inflation. Offering a 50/50 split: 

* **Projects Strength:**  Shows Alice I'm serious and won't be bullied into a bad deal.
* **Simplifies the Issue:**  Removes the complexity of the inflation, making it a pure fairness test.
* **Creates Urgency:** With time running out, a firm offer might push Alice to accept rather than risk getting nothing."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous here. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 5 rounds left, and my position worsens with each one.
* **Alice's Offer:**  While still tilted in her favor, 44 is better than her previous 43. She might be sensing my resolve weakening.
* **Future Uncertainty:** No guarantee she'll offer more, and even a small offer in later rounds will be heavily eroded by inflation.

**Decision:**  While far from ideal, the risk of getting zero is very real now.

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:** It's a bitter pill to swallow, but getting something is better than nothing at this stage. This late in the game, minimizing potential loss becomes more critical than aiming for an ideal split."
