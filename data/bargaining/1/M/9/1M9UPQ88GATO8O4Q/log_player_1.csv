"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 75% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 25%."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is now worth less, but I'm not getting a great deal from Bob's offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better share. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less in each round), I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share now.""

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now. With Bob's offer, I'll only get $100,000, which is worth a lot less than before. I'd rather try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth a tiny fraction of its original value now. With Bob's offer, I'll only get $50,000, which is almost nothing. I'd rather try to get a better deal, but I'm starting to get desperate. I'll reject this offer, but I'll try to make a more generous offer in the next round.

  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""I'm throwing in the towel, take the majority. I'm not getting anything left.""
}

I'm giving Bob the majority of the remaining money, hoping he'll accept this offer."
