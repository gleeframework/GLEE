**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, accepting now would give me only $440,000 (which is worth significantly less than it was in round 1 due to inflation). I'm banking on Alice being more averse to getting $0 and hoping she'll make a better offer in the next few rounds.  It's a risky gamble, but I need to push my luck a bit further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution.  We're running out of rounds, and getting nothing helps neither of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  While I want a better share, offering 50/50 shows I'm willing to compromise but not be taken advantage of. It's a strong stance that highlights the urgency of the situation."
