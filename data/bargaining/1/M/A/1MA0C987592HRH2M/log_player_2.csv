"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  This gives you a decent sum upfront. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a decent offer in the first round, Bob can likely do better by waiting and seeing if Alice will become more desperate as the rounds progress and the money loses value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split. It's fair to us both, and we can avoid any further risk of losing value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the most generous you'll get. Don't be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting worse, and the potential for Bob to gain a larger share by waiting is still there."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""This offer is still better for both of us than letting the money lose more value. Let's reach a fair agreement now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. Take this offer before the money is worth even less for you! 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is decreasing, and Bob is still losing value. It is reasonable to assume Alice will be more willing to compromise as the remaining rounds decrease. There is a strong possibility that a better offer might come from Alice in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""We're nearing the end of the game. Let's make a compromise. This offer is a step towards a fair split, and we can avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising again. Don't be foolish, accept this offer before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still decreasing, and the money Bob gains is losing significant value with every round.  Bob can likely secure a larger share by continuing to reject and pushing for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""We are getting very close to the end of the game. It's in both our interests to find a solution now. I'm offering a more even split, and I hope you'll accept.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous!  Accept this generous offer before we both get nothing! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice is getting increasingly desperate, the offer is still very unfavorable to Bob.  The loss of value due to inflation is high, and Bob has a better chance of securing a more even split by continuing to reject and pushing for a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 850000,
""alice_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""This is our final chance to reach an agreement.  We both risk losing everything if we don't compromise. Let's split the money more evenly. This offer reflects the remaining value loss and is the fairest solution.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's still heavily in my favor, but it's the last chance for you to get a significant amount. Don't be a fool! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still quite unfavorable to Bob, even though it's her final offer. Bob has already rejected offers with similar or even better splits for him, and the risk of getting nothing is now significant.  However, in this final round, Bob can afford to be a bit more aggressive.  There's a chance that Alice might cave and make a counter-offer closer to his desired split, or at least offer a slightly better deal.  

By rejecting, Bob is putting pressure on Alice and potentially forcing a more favorable deal in the final round.  There's a chance of getting nothing, but the potential reward of a better split in the last round outweighs the risk."

Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. We've both been stubborn, and the risk of losing everything is now very high. This is the fairest split we can achieve given the remaining value. Accept it, or we both get nothing.""
