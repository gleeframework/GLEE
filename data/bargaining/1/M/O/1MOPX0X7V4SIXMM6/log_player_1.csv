"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my potential gain is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm trying to be more generous, but still want to secure a decent amount for myself."
