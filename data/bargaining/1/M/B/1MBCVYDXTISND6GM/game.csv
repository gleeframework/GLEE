70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30.  It's important to settle this early because the value of the money decreases with each round.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Hey Alice, let's split it more fairly. I think 55-45 is a good compromise. Remember, the money is worth less to you with each passing round!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, this is a fair offer, especially considering the time pressure and the decreasing value. I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to make sense for both of us. Let's not risk losing everything!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, but I still think your offer is a bit one-sided. Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'm willing to take a bit more. Let's settle on 58-42 and call it a day!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is slipping away with each round.  This offer is a good balance - let's be reasonable and close this out now before we both lose!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand the urgency, but I'm not willing to settle for less than 60. Given the inflation, your 60 is worth significantly less than it was initially. Let's be realistic about the current value.",Bob,6,
