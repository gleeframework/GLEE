"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 80-20""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, as the money is worth less with each round. Let's be reasonable and move on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather not accept a 45-55 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to make a counteroffer: 60-40""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider a slightly more favorable split for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is affecting my potential gain even more, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think 65-35 is a fairer split now""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
