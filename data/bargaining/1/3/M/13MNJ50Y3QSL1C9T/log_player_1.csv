"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This leaves a decent amount for Bob while giving me a significant majority. I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this early on to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a major factor here. Accepting this offer means I get to keep 300,000, even with the inflation, which is better than the 720,000 I would have gotten if I had rejected the previous offer."
