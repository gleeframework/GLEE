"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 600,000$ and leaving 400,000$ for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:
Alice gain: 500,000 * 0.9 = 450,000
Bob gain: 500,000 * 0.9 = 450,000

I accept Bob's offer.
