"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Since Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I would get $5,000, which is still less than my initial offer of $6,000. However, considering the inflation, my $5,000 would be worth less than my initial $6,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob. Let's make a deal!""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
