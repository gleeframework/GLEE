Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'm being generous here 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but I need to accept this offer.  Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** I'm losing almost 60% of the value each round. Waiting any longer means accepting an even worse deal.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:**  Alice has consistently offered me a worse deal, and she knows the inflation is hurting me.  It's unlikely she'll suddenly offer something better. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  If I reject this, I risk walking away with nothing if I can't reach a deal with Alice in the next round.

While 43 is much lower than I'd like, the longer the game goes on, the worse it gets for me.  It's time to cut my losses."
