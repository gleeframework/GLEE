"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive rounds, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal.  It's only the first round, and I'm not sure Alice understands the impact of inflation on her.  Let's see if I can negotiate a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script this round.  I'm willing to be more generous now that you understand the impact of inflation.  This offer benefits us both in the long run.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for me in this game.  I'm willing to compromise, but this offer ensures we both benefit significantly.  Let's be practical. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting late in the game and Alice's offer is still reasonable.  I don't want to risk losing out on a decent share due to continued inflation."
