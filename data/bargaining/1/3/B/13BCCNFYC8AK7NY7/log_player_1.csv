"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 5500 is worth 20% less than the 6000 I initially proposed, and Bob's gain of 4500 is 5% less than the 4000 I initially proposed. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, but I'm still hoping Bob will accept to avoid further rounds!"
