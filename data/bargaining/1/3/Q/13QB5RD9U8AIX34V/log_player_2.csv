Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's aim for a more even split of 60/40. This balances our shares while accounting for the decreasing value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
