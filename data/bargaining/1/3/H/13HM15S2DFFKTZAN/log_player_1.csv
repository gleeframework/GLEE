```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,

}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for a better split 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the difference between our gains is still relatively small, I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Since Bob was offering 25% in the previous round, I'll try to increase my gain to 80%:

  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger bite""
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30
