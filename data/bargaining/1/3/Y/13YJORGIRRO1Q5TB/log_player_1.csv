"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1

I'll make a fair offer to start, considering we both want to walk away with something. Since the value of money decreases for me with each round, I'll aim to find a balance that might appeal to Bob while also securing a decent amount for myself.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Fair start, let's cooperate!""
}
```

### 

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I think a 50/50 split is the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2

Considering the offer and the impact of inflation, I must calculate the actual value I'd receive. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, the $50 offered is actually worth $40 to me. Given this, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal, especially since we're early in the game.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Let's proceed and see if we can find a more favorable division in the next round.

### 

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3

Given that we're in the third round and the value of money continues to decrease for me, I need to adjust my strategy to ensure I walk away with a substantial amount. Considering Bob's previous offer and the fact that the money's value hasn't changed for him, I'll make a slightly more conservative offer to try and reach an agreement.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, with a slight adjustment for inflation.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
