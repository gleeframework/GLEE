"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too low for me. How about this split instead?"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Due to inflation, the value of the money decreases each round. It's in Bob's best interest to secure a favorable deal sooner rather than later.
* **Fairness & Incentive:** While Alice's initial offer wasn't terrible, it significantly favored her. This counter-offer is designed to be more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for Alice to accept a deal that's better than waiting for inflation to erode the value further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, given the inflation we're both facing. Let's end this and get our share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth to both players. A 50/50 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal later when the value has depreciated further. 
* **Fair Offer:** While Bob could push for a slightly better deal, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the circumstances. Accepting ensures Bob receives a decent share and avoids the risk of walking away with significantly less if negotiations continue."
