"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly in half, we can negotiate further if you'd like""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower amount, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not as eager to accept this offer as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less for me, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve the majority of the money""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I should get a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less for me now, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions. However, this offer seems reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money.

I'll accept this offer.
