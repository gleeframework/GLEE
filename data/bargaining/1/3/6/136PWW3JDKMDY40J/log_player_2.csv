Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The money's losing value fast, Bob. Let's be reasonable. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and Alice's message that this is her final offer, I think it's better to accept this deal rather than risking further devaluation of the money in the next rounds."
