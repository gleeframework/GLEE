"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll take it to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting the offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. However, a 50/50 split is a fair offer, and I don't see any reason to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
