"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise and meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in Round 2, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,000
* Bob gain: $5,000

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and meeting in the middle is a fair way to divide the money. I'll accept his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
