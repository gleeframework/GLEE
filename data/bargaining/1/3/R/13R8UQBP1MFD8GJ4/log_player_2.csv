I'm rejecting Alice's offer. While it's tempting to take anything at this point, I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm not giving up yet!"

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering Alice $8,000 and keeping $2,000 for myself. The inflation is really hurting my potential gains, so I'm willing to take a smaller share now to avoid getting nothing. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping Alice will accept and we can both walk away with something."

```

I'm rejecting Alice's offer. While it's tempting to take anything at this point, the potential gain is so small that it's not worth it. The inflation is really taking its toll, but I'm still holding out hope for a better offer in the next round."

Round 12
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 1000, ""alice_gain"": 9000} 
```

This is it, the final round. I'm offering Alice $9,000 and taking $1,000 for myself. The inflation has decimated my potential earnings, but I'm desperate to avoid getting nothing. I'm hoping Alice sees the value in settling now rather than risking it all on the next round, where we'll both get nothing."
