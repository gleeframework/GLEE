"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bigger share! 

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be careful. My gain of $300,000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $285,000. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $700,000 is still worth $700,000.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 90.25% of the original amount.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer this time, let's see if you accept!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to take a bigger share!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $400,000 is worth 85.74% of the original amount, which is approximately $857,400.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain is now worth 85.74% of the original amount.

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
