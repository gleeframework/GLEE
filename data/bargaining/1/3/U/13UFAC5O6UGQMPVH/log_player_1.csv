"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 10% less, so it's actually $45 in ""real"" value.

Bob's gain of $50 is worth 20% less, so it's actually $40 in ""real"" value.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is still affecting the money, I'll make a new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still trying to be generous."
