Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not be hasty. This offer still gives you a significant portion, and it saves us both from further losses. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. This is a good deal for both of us. Don't let greed lead to us both losing out.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's more than fair considering the circumstances. Let's end this now and both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of getting zero is increasing rapidly.
* **Alice's Declining Returns:**  The value of the money for Alice is decreasing significantly each round.  It's unlikely she'll offer anything significantly better in the future.
* **Reasonable Offer:** While not ideal, 45 is a reasonable portion, and significantly better than risking getting nothing. 

Waiting any longer puts Bob in a weaker position, as Alice is likely to become increasingly desperate and offer even less favorable splits."
