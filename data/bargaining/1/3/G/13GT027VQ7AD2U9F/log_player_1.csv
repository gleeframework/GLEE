"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000 and I'll take 6000. It's a fair split, considering I'm taking the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers.  
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject his offer, since it's the same as my original proposal. I'm hoping to get a better deal next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll try to take a bigger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more. 7000 is a fair amount, considering the risks and benefits.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50.  We've both been playing hardball, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  A fair split is the only way we both get anything worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate!

I'll accept his offer, since it's a 50/50 split and we've both been rejecting each other's offers for a while. It's time to cut our losses and walk away with something.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
