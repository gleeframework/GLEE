"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but I'll give you a chance to agree to it. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the total amount, especially considering the money's value will decrease by 20% for me in each subsequent round. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the money's value will decrease by 20% for me in each subsequent round, I'll try to make a more balanced offer to Alice while still being mindful of my own gain.
