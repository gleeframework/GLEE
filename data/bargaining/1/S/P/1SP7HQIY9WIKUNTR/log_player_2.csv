"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm starting with a slight advantage considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this round.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to be left with less than half.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my previous offer. Inflation is a factor for both of us, but it hits you harder. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to make a significant difference.  I'm better off accepting Alice's offer and ending the game."
