"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this game quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, but it's a fair start to the negotiation 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to reject it. I'm not willing to take a 10% share of the remaining money, especially since I know the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, and 25% less than in round 1.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'm not going to give up now 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive! With the inflation affecting my gain, I'd be left with a tiny fraction of the original amount. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation.

I'll make a new offer, trying to salvage what's left:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet, Bob. Meet me at 40-60 and let's end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, hoping Bob will finally accept and we can conclude the game."
