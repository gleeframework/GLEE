"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and generous offer for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it 50-50. That's a fair offer, and it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money before inflation reduces its value further. I'll accept this offer.
