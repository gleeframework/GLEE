"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly considering the inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's proposal is fair in the first round, I'm rejecting it. I'm aware of the inflation factor and want to maximize my potential gain. By rejecting, I force Alice to make a proposal in the next round, where the money will be worth less to her, potentially incentivizing her to offer me a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm taking advantage of the inflation to secure a larger share. Let's make this a quick deal, or we both risk losing more.""}
