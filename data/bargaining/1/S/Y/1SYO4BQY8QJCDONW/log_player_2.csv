Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severely Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is drastically eating into Bob's potential gains. Accepting $3800 now is better than risking another round where his share will be worth even less.
* **Alice Holds the Advantage:** Alice is clearly aware of the inflation's impact on Bob and is likely to propose even worse deals in the future.  
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a real possibility of reaching a round where the inflation makes his potential gain negligible, leaving him with nothing. 

While not ideal, taking the $3800 now cuts Bob's losses and prevents him from being left empty-handed."
