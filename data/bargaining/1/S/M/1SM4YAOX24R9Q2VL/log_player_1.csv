"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 900,000 - 100,000 split. It's a fair starting point, and gives Bob a chance to see I'm willing to be generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. Even with the inflation, 300,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 600,000 - 400,000 split.  This is still a good deal for Bob, and it accounts for the inflation we've seen. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, with the inflation the money is worth significantly less. A 450,000 gain is still a good outcome for me, and it's more likely I'll get nothing if I reject and the game continues."
