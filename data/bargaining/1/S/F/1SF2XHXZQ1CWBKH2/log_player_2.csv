"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the faster inflation for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept.  We have 12 rounds, and the inflation will affect Alice much more than me. I can try to get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly, considering the inflation rate. This way, we both get a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, how about a compromise? This offer is closer to your split, but still acknowledges the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. This is a good compromise, and we both get a decent amount."
