"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me, I'm not as keen on the 50/50 split as I was initially. I'd rather try to negotiate for more. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to give up 50. How about 55 for me?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so it's worth 90% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm still open to negotiations, but I think 55 is a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm sticking with my previous message, but adjusting the numbers slightly to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55 is too low for me. How about 52 for me and 48 for you? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. Bob's offer of 55 for himself is still quite high, but I'm not sure I can do better. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, fine. You got a good deal, Bob!""
}
```"
