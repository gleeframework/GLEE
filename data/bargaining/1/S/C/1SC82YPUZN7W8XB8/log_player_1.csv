I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for the majority of the money. Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair. While I'm losing 10% of the value of my potential gain, he's only losing 5%. It's not worth accepting such a lopsided deal. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate something fairer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly more even split this time. Since I'm losing more value due to inflation, I need to make a more appealing offer to avoid getting stuck with nothing. Hopefully, this is a reasonable compromise."
