Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering a proposal that's heavily in my favor.  I want to see how Bob reacts and how willing he is to risk going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly in his favor, but I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round.  Even with the inflation, the money is worth more to me now than it would be if I rejected this offer."
