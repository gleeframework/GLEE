"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 50% of the initial $100, which is a fair and equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my 40% share is actually worth less than the 50% I offered initially. However, Bob's 60% is also worth more than my initial 50%. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher percentage for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is similar to my previous offer, but with a slightly lower percentage for myself.

I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
