Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging. This is the fairest deal, considering how much the value of your share has decreased with each round. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a classic example of game theory where waiting has diminishing returns for Bob. Here's why Bob should accept despite it seeming wildly unfair:

* **The Value of Time:**  The money is losing value for Bob with every round. While getting only $1 is terrible, holding out for a better deal in the next round means the offer will be worth even less to him. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems set on her initial offer. There's no guarantee she will ever budge, and continuing to decline just means Bob loses more value.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but at this point, accepting the $1 is the most logical choice for Bob to minimize his losses."
