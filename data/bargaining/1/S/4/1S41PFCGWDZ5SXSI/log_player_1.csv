"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 2:1. I'll take $4000 and you'll get $6000. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
