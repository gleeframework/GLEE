"Round 1

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value. I'm willing to be slightly flexible, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly aware of the impact of inflation, particularly on her potential gains. She's trying to pressure me by presenting a ""final offer"". However, even with the reduced value, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. The value is slipping away with each round. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my offer.  It's clear you're aiming for a larger share, but this is a fair deal considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is digging her heels in, but her offer is getting worse for me with each round of inflation.  It's time to show I'm serious and willing to risk it going down to the wire.  There's still a chance she'll break and accept a lower amount to avoid getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now.  Take it or leave it - but the deal won't get any better for you.""
