"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority and you can take the rest.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a big chunk, but you'll still have to compromise 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the offer, I'm tempted to accept since I'd get a bigger share than in the first round. However, I'm not thrilled about the 30% share for Bob.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm still the one who's making the biggest sacrifice here.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the remaining $100, which is $80, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $20. I'm trying to be more generous this time around, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the offer, I'm still not thrilled about the 25% share for Bob, but I'm getting a bit desperate. The 75% share I'd get is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a smaller share.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
