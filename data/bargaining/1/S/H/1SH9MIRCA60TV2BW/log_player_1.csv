"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, knowing that it's worth less with each passing round.  I figure Bob might accept since it's better than getting nothing if we reach the 12th round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial proposal. While it's tempting to take $1000,  I'm going to reject it.  The inflation is working against us both, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round by making my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This time, I'm offering a more balanced split.  I'm still aiming for a majority, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid a stalemate.  This offer reflects the decreasing value of money, while still giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer again.  Bob is still trying to get a larger share despite the decreasing value of money.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round by making my own proposal.  I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering an even split this round. We're both losing money with each passing round, and this seems like the fairest way to divide what's left.  Hopefully, Bob sees the sense in this and accepts."
