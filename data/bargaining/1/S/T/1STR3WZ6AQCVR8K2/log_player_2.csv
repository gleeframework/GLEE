I'm going to reject this offer.  While I'm getting something, it's a very small share, and with the inflation risk, I can likely get a better deal in the next round."

Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still going to reject this offer. While it's better than her first offer, I still think I can do better. I'm holding out for a more even split."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a serious offer. It reflects the time pressure and the fact that we both need to agree soon. You're getting a decent chunk, and this protects me somewhat from the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While the time pressure is real, and Alice's offer is getting closer to a fairer split, I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal in the coming rounds."
