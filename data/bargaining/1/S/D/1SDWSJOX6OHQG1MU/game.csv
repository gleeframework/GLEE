60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a fair starting point for us both.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's flip the script! I'll take 60 this time, and you can have 40.  It's only fair we both get a chance to be the 'big' earner.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Okay, Bob, how about a 55/45 split? I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to be reasonable for me considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"I'm going to push for a 65/35 split.  It's a fair compromise given the inflation, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  I'm offering you 48 which is more than you'd get if we split 50/50 after inflation.  Let's be realistic and get this deal done.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, let's be practical.  We're both losing money with every round.  I'm offering you 30, which is better than what you'd get after another round of inflation.  It's time to reach a compromise.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it.  It's the fairest deal considering the circumstances.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, I understand you're frustrated, but we're both losing money with every round.  This time, I'm offering a 75/25 split.  It's a significant concession for me, and it's time to be realistic.  Let's end this before we both get nothing.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
48.0,52.0,"Bob, I'm giving you another chance.  This is a 48/52 split in your favor.  Take it, and we can both walk away with something.  Time is running out.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, we're both running out of time.  I'm offering you 20, which is better than nothing. It's a fair compromise given the inflation, and it allows us to both get something.  Let's end this before we both lose everything.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, this is it.  My final offer.  55 for you, 45 for me.  Take it, and we both get something. Reject it, and we both get nothing.  Don't be greedy, Bob.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
10.0,90.0,"Alice, this is it.  My final offer.  I'm taking 90, and you're getting 10.  You've seen how the inflation has been working in my favor.  It's time to be realistic.  Take it or we both get nothing.",Bob,12,
