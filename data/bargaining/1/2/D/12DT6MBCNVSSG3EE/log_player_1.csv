"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, giving myself a larger share but leaving Bob with something. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has reduced the value of my potential earnings, this is a fair offer that ensures I get something.  It's better to take the 50% now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
