"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob.  This is my best offer. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This is a terrible offer. While the money is worth less to Alice each round, it's worth the same to me. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly. You get a smaller share, but we both still get something.  ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair split. We both get half, and we can finally move on. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
This is a good deal. While Alice's share has decreased slightly due to inflation, we both get half.  Let's end this."
