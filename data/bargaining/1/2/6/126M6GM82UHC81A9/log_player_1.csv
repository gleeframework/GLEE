"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the lowball, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a very generous offer from Bob!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a lowball, Bob! I'm not accepting such an uneven split.""
}
```

It's my turn to make a new offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so my potential gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. A more balanced split this time""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's more favorable to me, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not very generous, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too uneven for me, Bob. I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'll keep negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll, and my potential gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Getting close, Bob. Meet me at 45/55 and let's wrap this up""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
