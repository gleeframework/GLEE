"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $3000 is a significant reduction from my initial proposal of $5000. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 7:3 ratio.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to make it more balanced""}

I'm proposing a 9:11 ratio, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping some advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I'm still looking for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $4000 is a significant reduction from my initial proposal of $4500. However, Bob's offer is getting closer to my original proposal.

I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 6:4 ratio. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's a good compromise.
