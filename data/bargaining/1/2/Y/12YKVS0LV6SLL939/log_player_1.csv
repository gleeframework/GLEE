"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a classic negotiation game. I'm starting with a high offer for myself, leaving a small portion for Bob.  I hope to entice him into accepting, but if not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round to account for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is now more favorable to me, I still believe I can do better. The inflation has affected the value of my potential gains significantly, so I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob rejected my previous offer and inflation has hit my gains, I'm adjusting my offer slightly. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm acknowledging Bob's increased bargaining power. This offer demonstrates flexibility while still attempting to maximize my return."
