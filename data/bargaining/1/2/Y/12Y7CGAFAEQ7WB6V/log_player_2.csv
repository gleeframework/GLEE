Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you closer to halfway, but I still think I have the upper hand 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the best choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer this goes on, the less any offer is worth to me (Bob).  I'm already losing almost 20% of the potential value.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aiming to maximize her gains and is willing to drag this out. It's unlikely she'll offer significantly more favorable terms.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer means risking an even worse offer in later rounds.  A 45/55 split is better than a potential 40/60 or worse if Alice continues to lowball. 

While accepting means Alice gets more, it's the most logical decision to minimize losses due to inflation."
