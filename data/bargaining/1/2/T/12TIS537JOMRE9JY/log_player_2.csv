"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm confident we can work something out. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's not fair that Alice gets to keep 60% of the money. I think we can do better than that. Let's see what happens in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'm excited to make a counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more reasonable. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll take that into account.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. Let's work together!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. It's fair and we can both get a decent share after the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI think a 50/50 split is a good starting point, but considering the inflation, I'm not sure it's the best deal for me. The money I gain is worth 19% less now, so I need to think carefully about this.\n\n###\n\nHowever, since Alice is also losing value due to inflation, and she's offering a 50/50 split, I think it's a relatively fair offer. I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round, so I'll accept this offer.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
