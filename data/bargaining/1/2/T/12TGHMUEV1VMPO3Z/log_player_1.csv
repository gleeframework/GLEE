"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, and 10% less for Bob, compared to the first round. 

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good one, considering the inflation. If we meet in the middle, I'd be giving up a significant amount of value. However, I don't have any information about Bob's valuation of the money, so I'll have to make a decision based on my own.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was to meet in the middle, I'll try to take a bit more. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! I'm trying to be reasonable here! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. Bob's offer seems like a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'm not sure if Bob is being reasonable, but I don't have any information about his valuation of the money. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to decide carefully.
