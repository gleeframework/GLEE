# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI won't accept this offer as I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in subsequent rounds, despite the inflation. Let's proceed to the next round where I'll make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Although the inflation is working against me, Alice seems willing to make concessions, and I'd like to explore how far she's willing to go. Let's proceed to the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I see you're willing to move, but I still think we can find a middle ground that accounts for the inflation I'm facing. Let's try to meet in the middle.""}"

Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. The clock is ticking, and it's hurting you more than me. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation and Alice's assertion that this is her final offer, I believe accepting this deal is the best course of action. Further negotiations may lead to a worse outcome due to the devaluing of the money for me."
