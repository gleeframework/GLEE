"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll get a bit more""}\n\n###\nI'm offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with a message suggesting a relatively fair division, slightly in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is fair, as we both lose money over time. Let's wrap it up. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, my share of $4000 is now worth less than it would have been in the first round. I believe I can propose a better division in the next round, taking into account the inflation factor. Let's proceed and see if we can find a more favorable agreement!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'm offering $5500 for myself and $4500 for Bob. Given the impact of inflation on my potential gain, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us. The message conveys my willingness to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable solution."
