"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more equitable split is possible. This ensures both of us get a good return, and avoids us losing money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While not ideal to get slightly less, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal later."
