Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  While the time pressure is on, accepting an offer significantly less than half means losing out on a substantial amount. I'm betting Alice will become more willing to compromise as we get closer to the final rounds."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Really my last offer, don't be stubborn 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is very high.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept a less favorable split than to get nothing at all if Alice is serious about this being her final offer."
