Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. This is my final offer before the money loses even more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough decision, but I'll accept.  While I'd like a larger share, further rounds risk diminishing returns for both of us. Accepting now ensures a reasonable payout before inflation eats away at the value."
