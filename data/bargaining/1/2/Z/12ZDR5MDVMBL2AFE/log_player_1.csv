I propose a 990,000 to 10,000 split in my favor.  While it seems unfair, I believe this is the best way to ensure I get a significant portion of the money given the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering 900,000 to Bob's 100,000. While I'm still taking the lion's share, I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering he rejected my previous offer and the risk of further inflation."
