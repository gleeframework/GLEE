300000.0,700000.0,How about a more even split? I propose 70% for me and 30% for you. It's important to find a balance.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's aim for 80/20 this time. We both need to be realistic about the diminishing value of the money.,Alice,3,

700000.0,300000.0,"We're running out of time. Let's be reasonable and split the money 70/30. It's better than nothing, and we can both still walk away with a significant sum.",Alice,5,
