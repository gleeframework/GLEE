"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. This is a good start, and we can adjust as the game goes on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for me! I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""How about a more even split? I propose 70% for me and 30% for you. It's important to find a balance.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's aim for 80/20 this time. We both need to be realistic about the diminishing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is moving in the right direction, that's still not a good deal for me, especially with the inflation eating into my share. I need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""The value decreases rapidly with each round. Let's be practical - I propose a 60/40 split. This benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time. Let's be reasonable and split the money 70/30. It's better than nothing, and we can both still walk away with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but with the increasing inflation rate, it's getting too risky. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees me something, which is better than walking away with nothing if we run out of rounds."
