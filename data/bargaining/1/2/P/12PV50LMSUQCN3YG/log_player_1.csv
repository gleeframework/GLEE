"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1. This means I would receive 75$ and you would receive 25$. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, this might be a good offer for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  It's a fair deal and avoids further inflation losses for me. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
