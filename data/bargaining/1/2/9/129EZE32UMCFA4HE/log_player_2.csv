**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial split, even as inflation eats away at the value.  While her offer *is* getting closer to a more balanced share, we're still in early rounds. Holding out a bit longer might push her closer to a 50/50 split, which is the fairest outcome, especially with the time pressure of inflation."
