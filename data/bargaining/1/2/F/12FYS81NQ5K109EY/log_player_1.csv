"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a significant gap in the offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty big difference. I'd like to propose a compromise in round 3.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to propose a more balanced offer. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll give you a bit more than 40%""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives Bob a bit more than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an even more skewed offer than before. I'm not willing to accept such a large disparity.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too uneven, I'd like to try to get a better deal""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to propose a more balanced offer again. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to find a sweet spot, I'll give you a bit more than 50%""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives Bob a slightly larger share."
