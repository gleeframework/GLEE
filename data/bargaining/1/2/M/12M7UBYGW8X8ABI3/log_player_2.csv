"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 sentiment, but the inflation hits me harder. I need a little more to make it worthwhile. This offer is still a win-win. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100
