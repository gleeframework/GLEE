Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair: a 50/50 split.  No need to drag this out and risk losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
