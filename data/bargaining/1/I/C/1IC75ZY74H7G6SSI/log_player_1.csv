Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal this round, Alice.  Let's split the money 5500/4500.  This takes into account the inflation, but also gives you a good share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
