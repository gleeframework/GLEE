"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000. This seems fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers in the next round.  I'm not happy with the current offer, even with the inflation consideration. I'll see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal this round, Alice.  Let's split the money 5500/4500.  This takes into account the inflation, but also gives you a good share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'll take a little less this time, considering the inflation. $5500 for me, $4500 for you.  It's a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation hurts, I'm not sure I can get a better deal than this. I'll accept the offer and take the $4500."
