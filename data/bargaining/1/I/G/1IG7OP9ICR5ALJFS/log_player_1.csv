"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected the 50/50 split, so I'll try to get more! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since I rejected the 50/50 split, Bob is trying to take advantage of that by offering a more skewed split. However, I'm not sure if I want to give him an even bigger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more balanced offer. I'll give him a bit less than 60, but still more than 50.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not that much!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not giving me enough, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing for a bigger share! With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to think carefully about this one. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. On the other hand, giving him 70% of the money now might be a bad idea.

However, I think I'll take a risk and reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make an even more extreme offer next round, which I can then reject, and so on. This way, I might be able to get a better deal in the end.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob. I'll give him a smaller share, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a bigger share, but I'm not going to give in that easily!""
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a relatively large share, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, so I'll take the biggest share I can get now! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really going for broke now! With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'm starting to get worried that I'll be left with nothing if I reject this offer. However, giving him 90% of the money is a huge concession. I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up that much.

I'll think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make an even more extreme offer next round, and I can try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a bold move and try to take a larger share for myself. I'll offer Bob a relatively small amount, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a stand and demanding a bigger share. You can either accept or risk losing even more!""
}
```

# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing for a huge share now! With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'm starting to get desperate. Giving him 95% of the money is an extremely bad deal, and I'm not sure if I can afford to reject it.

However, I'll try to hold out for a better deal. I've come too far to give in now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make an even more extreme offer next round, and I can try to negotiate a better deal."

With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a last-ditch effort to get a decent share. I'll offer Bob a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept it and we can finally settle.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 99,
  ""message"": ""I'm giving up, take it all if you want it. I'll just be happy to get something.""
}
```
