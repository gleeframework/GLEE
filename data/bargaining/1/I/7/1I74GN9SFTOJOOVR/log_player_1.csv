"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the Initial Offer
To start the game, I need to decide on an initial offer that is reasonable yet strategic. Since the goal is to come to an agreement while maximizing my gain, I'll consider starting with a division that slightly favors me but is not so skewed that Bob would immediately reject it.

### Step 2: Consider Bob's Perspective
Bob needs to feel that the offer is fair enough to consider accepting. If the offer is too biased towards me, Bob might reject it, hoping for a better deal in the next round or aiming to negotiate a more favorable outcome.

### Step 3: Formulate the Offer and Message
Given these considerations, I will propose a division where I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. This split gives me a slightly larger share, reflecting my initiative in making the first offer, but still provides Bob with a substantial amount, making it a potentially acceptable deal.

The message to Bob will be: ""Let's start with a fair but slightly favorable offer to me, considering I'm initiating the negotiation.""

### Step 4: Encode the Offer in JSON Format
To formalize the proposal according to the game's rules, I will encode it in JSON format as required.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair but slightly favorable offer to me, considering I'm initiating the negotiation.""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a slight advantage, but this feels more balanced. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's Offer
Bob has made a counteroffer where he takes $55 and I get $45. This is essentially the reverse of my initial proposal.

### Step 2: Consider the Negotiation Dynamics
Given that Bob rejected my first offer and has now made a counteroffer, it's clear he is willing to negotiate but wants a deal that either favors him slightly or is perfectly fair. His message suggests he believes his offer is more balanced.

### Step 3: Assess the Fairness and Strategic Implications
From a fairness perspective, his offer is as reasonable as mine was, just flipped. Strategically, accepting this offer means I would be conceding to his terms, which might not be the best outcome if I believe I can negotiate a better deal. However, rejecting it and pushing for another round risks potentially getting a worse offer or prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily.

### Step 4: Make a Decision
Considering the dynamics and the offer itself, I will decide to reject Bob's offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable or at least an equally favorable outcome.

### Step 5: Encode the Decision in JSON Format
To formalize my decision according to the game's rules, I will encode it in JSON format as required.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{reject}$"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Re-evaluate the Negotiation Position
Given that Bob's offer was the reverse of my initial proposal and I rejected it, it's clear we are both aiming for a slightly favorable deal. However, since we've both had our offers rejected, it's time to consider a compromise that could satisfy both parties.

### Step 2: Determine a Compromise Offer
A logical next step is to propose a division that is exactly fair or slightly more favorable to me but still acknowledges Bob's desire for a balanced deal. Considering this, I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is the most straightforward compromise.

### Step 3: Formulate the Offer and Message
I will propose a division where both Bob and I receive $50 each. This split is perfectly fair and should be acceptable to Bob if he is genuinely seeking a balanced deal.

The message to Bob will be: ""Given our previous offers, a 50-50 split seems like the most balanced and fair outcome for both of us.""

### Step 4: Encode the Offer in JSON Format
To formalize the proposal according to the game's rules, I will encode it in JSON format as required.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Given our previous offers, a 50-50 split seems like the most balanced and fair outcome for both of us.""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
