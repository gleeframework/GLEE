"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $60 and Bob can have $40. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. The message is a lighthearted way to begin the conversation.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say? ###\n\n(Please respond in the same JSON format)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's better than nothing! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly seems fair, I'm considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round, I'd actually be getting less value than in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more this time""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the 20% decrease in value for my gain and the 10% decrease for Bob's gain. To make up for the loss, I'll increase my share to $58 and offer Bob $42. The message explains my reasoning and shows that I'm willing to adapt to the changing circumstances.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We need to be careful with inflation. Let's try to get closer to an even split, but I'll take a slightly larger share this time to account for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer of a 45-55 split is still not favorable to me, especially considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation. I've lost nearly half the value of my potential gain since the first round, and I'm not willing to settle for less than half of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed to Round 5!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, I need a better share""}\n\nIn this round, I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, having lost nearly half the value of my potential gain since the first round. I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, trying to make up for the loss. The message conveys my concerns about the decreasing value and my need for a better share.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is a real problem, but we need to find a way to split the money fairly. I'm willing to take a larger share this time to account for the decreasing value, but I think we can still reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I've lost over 67% of the original value of my potential gain. At this point, accepting Bob's offer of a 40-60 split seems like the best option. I'll take the $40, which is still better than getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.\n\nLet's end the game here!"
