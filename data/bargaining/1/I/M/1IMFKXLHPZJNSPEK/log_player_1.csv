"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is a risky move, but I believe it's the best way to maximize my gains in the first round. I'm offering Bob a small portion, hoping he'll accept it and we can avoid further rounds with potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger portion, accepting this offer is the best option. My gains will be worth less with each round, and Bob's offer is a fair compromise considering the inflation."
