Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. This is my last offer, so think carefully. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is still very unfavorable, it's better than the likely outcome of further rounds.  With each round, Bob's share keeps increasing, and my share keeps decreasing. It's better to accept a smaller share than to risk getting nothing at all."
