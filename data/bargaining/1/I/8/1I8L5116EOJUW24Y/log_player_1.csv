Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. This leaves me with the majority of the money, but still allows for a potential negotiation in the future if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though my share is significantly less, it's still better than the 800,000 I would get if I reject and face another round of inflation.  It's a fair compromise considering the inflation factor."
