"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get more in the next rounds 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 2,000 is worth 80% of the original 2,000, which is 1,600. Bob's gain of 8,000 is worth 95% of the original 4,000, which is 7,600.

I'm not happy with the offer, but I'll have to think about it carefully. I'll reject the offer for now.
