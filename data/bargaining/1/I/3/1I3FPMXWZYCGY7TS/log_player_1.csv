Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims it's a fair deal, he's still getting slightly more, and the inflation is hurting him more than me.  I need to push for a better split before the money shrinks significantly."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, we're running out of time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point.  The inflation is eating away at the total, and waiting any longer is highly likely to result in a worse outcome for both of us. It's better to take a guaranteed, albeit smaller, amount than risk getting nothing at all."
