"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave 30% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $400,000. This offer is better than my previous one, and it's also better than the original 70% I proposed. I'll accept this offer.
