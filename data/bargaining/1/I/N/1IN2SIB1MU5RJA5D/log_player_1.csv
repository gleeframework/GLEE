Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small amount. I want to see if he's willing to accept a very unequal split, or if he's going to play it strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is a significant improvement over the first round, especially considering the inflation. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk losing even more money in the next round."
