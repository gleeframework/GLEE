"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 900,000$ and leave 100,000$ for Bob. I figure this is a good starting point, as it ensures that both of us get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to reduce my share slightly again, but this time I'm offering Bob a bigger share. I think it's important to try and find a compromise."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm going to keep reducing my share, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal.  It's becoming more and more likely that if we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both end up with nothing."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm sticking to my guns and rejecting this offer. The inflation is really starting to bite, so I need to get a bigger share if I'm going to get anything at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm going to keep lowering my share and hoping Bob will see that we need to make a deal.  I'm taking a big hit on the inflation, but I'm still hoping for a better outcome than getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject this offer.  I'm hoping Bob will realize we need to find a compromise, because we're both losing so much money with each passing round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  We're running out of time and the value of the money is shrinking fast.  I think a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something at this point."
