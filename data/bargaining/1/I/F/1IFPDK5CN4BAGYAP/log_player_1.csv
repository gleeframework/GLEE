"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split, but I'm still being generous! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, my gain of $600,000 is actually worth $570,000. And Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth $320,000.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if this is the best offer yet. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a slightly more aggressive offer than before, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me, my gain of $680,000 is actually worth $582,520. And Bob's gain of $320,000 is worth $166,400.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. The money is worth less and less with each round, so I'd rather get something now than risk waiting and getting even less."
