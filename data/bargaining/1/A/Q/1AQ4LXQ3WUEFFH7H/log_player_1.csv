"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to calculate the actual value of the money I'd gain, taking into account the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. If I gain $3,000, its value would be 90% of $3,000, which is $2,700.

However, I'm not sure about the value of Bob's gain, as the inflation effect on his side is unknown. To be cautious, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious, let's split it 45-55!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, giving me $4,500 and leaving $5,500 for Bob. This way, I'm trying to maximize my gain while still leaving a decent amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, the value of money is decreasing rapidly. I need to be even more careful with my decisions.

Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'd gain, taking into account the 27.1% decrease in value due to inflation. If I gain $4,000, its value would be 72.9% of $4,000, which is approximately $2,916.

However, I'm not sure about the value of Bob's gain, as the inflation effect on his side is unknown. Considering the 14.26% decrease in value, I'm not sure if $6,000 is a good deal for me.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate still high, I'll have to be very cautious with my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a chance to take the lead!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35-65 split, giving me $3,500 and leaving $6,500 for Bob. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally settle the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is getting out of control! The value of money is decreasing rapidly. Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'd gain, taking into account the 40.95% decrease in value due to inflation. If I gain $2,500, its value would be 59.05% of $2,500, which is approximately $1,476.25.

Considering the 22.62% decrease in value for Bob's gain, I'm not sure if $7,500 is a good deal for him, but it's definitely a good deal for me. However, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small amount.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate still high, I'll have to be extremely cautious with my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""I'm almost out of options, please be kind!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 20-80 split, giving me $2,000 and leaving $8,000 for Bob. This is a very aggressive concession, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally settle the deal."
