  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair start.""
}

Your turn!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think about it... 

I'd rather not give Bob a 60/40 advantage, so I'll reject this offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get closer to his desired share! I'll think about it...

Actually, I'll accept this offer. It's still a bit close to the 50/50 split I initially proposed, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
