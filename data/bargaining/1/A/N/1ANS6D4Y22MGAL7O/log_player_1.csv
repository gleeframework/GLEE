"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, let's start with a 50-50 split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, the actual amounts I'll gain and Bob will gain are:

* My gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750
* Bob's gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
