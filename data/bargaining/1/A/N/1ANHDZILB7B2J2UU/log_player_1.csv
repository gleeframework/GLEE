I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. This way, I avoid any potential inflation and secure a large portion of the money.  Let's see what he thinks!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my initial offer, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet.  I still have time, and with each round, the money I gain is worth less. I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a better deal in the next round!"

```

I'm taking a big gamble here, offering Bob a larger share to try and break the cycle. With inflation accelerating, I need to try something drastic to get a deal before the value of my share drops even further.  Let's hope this is enough to convince him."

This is my final offer. With the inflation at this level, I have to accept a 50/50 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing. Let's see if Bob finally accepts."
