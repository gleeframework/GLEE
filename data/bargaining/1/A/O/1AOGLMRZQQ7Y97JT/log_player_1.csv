I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept quickly. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep the majority of the money, the inflation factor is a real concern. I'm not sure how much it's affecting Bob, but I'm not willing to risk another round and potentially get a worse deal. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further risk."
