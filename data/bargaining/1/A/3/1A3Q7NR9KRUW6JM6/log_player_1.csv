"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'm actually getting $400,000 (500,000 * 0.8) and Bob is getting $400,000.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or wait for a better one.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 40% of its original value now (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). My new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable given the reduced value of the money. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Let's calculate the actual values for this offer:

Alice gain: 550,000 * 0.512 (80% of 68% of original value) = 280,640
Bob gain: 450,000 * 0.512 (80% of 68% of original value) = 230,176
