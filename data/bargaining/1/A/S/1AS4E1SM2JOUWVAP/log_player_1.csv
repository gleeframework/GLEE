"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. The message ""Let's make a fair deal!"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable and fair division, hoping he will accept it and end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn for a fair deal. This is a good offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and only 10% less for Bob, time is on Bob's side, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob 45 dollars and keeping 55 dollars for myself. Given that time is on Bob's side due to the inflation rates, I'm trying to find a middle ground that would be acceptable to both of us, thus the message ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle!"" I'm hoping this offer will seem reasonable enough for Bob to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, given the significant decrease in the value of the money for me (48.8% less than in the first round), I think this is the best deal I can get at this point. Bob's message indicates that this is his final offer, and considering the inflation, holding out for another round might not be beneficial for me. Therefore, I'm choosing to accept this offer and end the game here.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
