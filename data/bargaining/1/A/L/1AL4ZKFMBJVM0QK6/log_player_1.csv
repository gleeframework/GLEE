"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to propose a pretty generous split for Bob.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to start off strong and try to secure his acceptance. Hopefully he'll see this as a fair offer and we can finish this game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate something closer to my original proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 8500, but I'm still offering a significant portion to Bob.  Since I don't know how inflation is impacting him, I want to stay competitive but still ensure I get the majority of the money.  Hopefully this will be enough to convince him to accept the offer and we can avoid further rounds."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is getting worse for me. The inflation is hitting me hard.  I'm going to reject again and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable due to the inflation.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not going to give up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm still trying to be fair.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing money with each passing round, and that we need to come to an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to keep rejecting Bob's offers.  Although the inflation is hurting me, I'm still not comfortable with such a low share.  I'm going to try and hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

We are running out of time and the inflation is really hitting me hard. I'm taking a gamble and offering a slightly better share for Bob.  I'm hoping that this time, he will recognize that it's in his best interest to accept, as the consequences of rejection are getting more severe."
