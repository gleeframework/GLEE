Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. It's a strong offer for you considering the depreciation and the risk of getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
