"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 999,999 and leave you with 1 dollar. You can either take it or risk getting nothing in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While the risk exists, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better outcome in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. It's a strong offer for you considering the depreciation and the risk of getting nothing.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest option considering the inflation.  If you reject this, we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is now much more reasonable. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with a significant sum, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on her potential gains.  It's not worth the risk of getting nothing."
