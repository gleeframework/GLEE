"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, with a slight advantage for me considering the faster inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation rates and try to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the split to make it more even over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about adjusting for inflation, but my rate is harsher.  I'm willing to compromise slightly. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer since it seems like we're converging on a mutually acceptable split, and the inflation is making further rounds less appealing."
