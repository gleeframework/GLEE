"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split it evenly this round.  Let's see if we can agree on a fair solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Waiting longer means getting less, even if the split seems slightly better.
* **Alice's Declining Position:** Alice's potential gains are decreasing faster than yours. This makes her more likely to accept a fair deal sooner rather than later.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly larger share isn't worth the risk of getting nothing if the rounds run out."
