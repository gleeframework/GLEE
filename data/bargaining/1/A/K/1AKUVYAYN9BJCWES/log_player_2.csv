"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share to get this done quickly.  Let's split it 90/10 in my favor, and we can both walk away with some money. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round. With 11 rounds remaining, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. The current offer of 90/10 in Alice's favor is too skewed, and I think I can get a more equitable split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. A 60/40 split seems fair, considering we both want to walk away with a decent amount.""}\n\n###\nI've made an offer that is more balanced, taking into account that we both want to benefit from the deal. With 11 rounds remaining, I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. Let's see how Alice responds!"
