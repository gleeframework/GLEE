Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share to get this done quickly.  Let's split it 90/10 in my favor, and we can both walk away with some money.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. A 60/40 split seems fair, considering we both want to walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
