This is a classic negotiation game, and I'm aiming to get a large portion of the money. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm taking the lion's share, but still leaving something for Bob to make the offer more appealing.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy!  I'm not going to settle for such a small share. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm increasing Bob's portion to show I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to him."
