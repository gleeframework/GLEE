**Reasoning:**

The game simulates a negotiation with a time constraint (inflation). 

* **Alice is clearly aware of the situation and using it to her advantage.**  She's making increasingly unfavorable offers to Bob, knowing his potential gains decrease each round.
* **Round 5's offer is terrible for Bob.** He's getting significantly less than his initial offer in Round 1.
* **Continuing is very risky.** If Bob rejects this, there's a good chance Alice will offer even less in the next round, and his gains will be further eroded by inflation. 

**It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed, albeit smaller, amount now than risk getting even less later.**"
