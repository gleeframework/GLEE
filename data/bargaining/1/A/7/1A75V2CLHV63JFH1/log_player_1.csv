"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Fair share, let's start""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal for Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, still fair""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
