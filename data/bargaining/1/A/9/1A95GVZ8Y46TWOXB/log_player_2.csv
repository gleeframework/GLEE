Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I get 90%, you get 10%.  This is a good start, but I'm open to negotiating if you'd like to see a different split.

# Alice gain: 900000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite generous, but I'm sure you understand that a 50/50 split would be the fairest outcome. To move things along, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. This reflects the time value of money given the inflation we're facing. Think carefully about this offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 65/35 split in your favor is too far. Let's meet in the middle with a 60/40 split. This accounts for the inflation and gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
