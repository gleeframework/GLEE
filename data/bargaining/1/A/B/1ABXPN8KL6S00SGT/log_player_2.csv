While this seems like a fair offer, I can do much better by rejecting and making my own offer in the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. Time is money, and we're both losing out. This offer is still generous. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still being too generous. I'll reject and see if she'll make a better offer next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the money shrinks even further. It's still a good deal for you! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. It's time to take what I can and end this game."
