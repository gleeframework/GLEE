This is a tough choice! Alice is losing out on a lot of money, but there's a risk that if she rejects this offer, Bob might make a counter offer that is even worse. 

It seems like Bob is realizing that he's not getting a great deal, and Alice is getting very little in return.  Accepting is the best choice to maximize Alice's gain while minimizing the risk of getting nothing."
