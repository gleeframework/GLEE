"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which seems like a fair starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5000 is now worth $4500 in real terms, and Bob's gain of $5000 is worth $4000.

I accept the offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
