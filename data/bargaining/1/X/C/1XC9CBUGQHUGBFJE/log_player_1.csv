"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I think Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than I'd like, considering I'm still getting 45% of the original amount, but it's worth less due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, no more games""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
