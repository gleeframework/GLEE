"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives us a good head start and avoids too much loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure I understand the logic of the offer, but it's definitely not what I'd call ""reasonable."" I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a slightly more equitable split. This ensures we both have a decent share while still leaving room for negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  My turn to propose, and we're losing money with every round! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to bite. It's better to take this offer and secure some money than risk getting nothing at all."
