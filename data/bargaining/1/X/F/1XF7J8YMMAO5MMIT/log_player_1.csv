"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since my potential gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the reduced value. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm offering to take 42% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the reduced value of my share, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer in the first round's terms. 

In the first round, Bob's offer was 40% of $1,000,000. With inflation, my gain is worth 72.9% of the original value. Therefore, Bob's offer is equivalent to 40% of the original value, which is still a relatively high percentage. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
