"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. This is a fair deal, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round in hopes of getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the depreciation of the money's value for both of us. Given that the money loses 20% of its value for me with each round, I'm inclined to seek a compromise that benefits both parties, yet reflects the urgency on my part due to the higher rate of depreciation I'm facing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation.  Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 36% less than in the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision. The offer of $400,000, despite being lower than what I initially aimed for, becomes more attractive as the rounds progress and inflation continues to devalue the money. Given the decreasing value of the money and the risk of getting an even worse deal in subsequent rounds, I'm inclined to accept Alice's offer and end the game here."
