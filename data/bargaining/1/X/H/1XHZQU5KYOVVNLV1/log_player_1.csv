"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the negotiations unfold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'm effectively losing 5% of my potential gain compared to the first round.

I'm not sure if a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 60/40 split, considering the inflation. Can we try a 55/45 split instead?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make a new offer. Considering the inflation factor, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think 60% is a fairer split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
