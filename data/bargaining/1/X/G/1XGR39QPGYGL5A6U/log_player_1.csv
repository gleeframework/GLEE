"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm being generous and giving Bob 40% of the total amount, while I take 60%. This is a reasonable split, considering I'm making the first offer. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'll offer you 45%, I take 55%. It's still a great deal for you considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I'd get is lower than it seems. I think I can get a better deal in the next round, or make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, my previous offer is more reasonable now. Take 42% and let's settle""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation. I'm still taking a larger share, but Bob's share is not too bad either. I'm hoping he'll see the sense in settling now rather than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out. I'm offering you 48% - take it before inflation eats away at the value even more. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. Although the nominal value of the offer is slightly higher than before, the actual value is significantly lower due to inflation. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the time pressure, but I'm not ready to give in yet. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation hurts us both. I'll take 56%, but it's better than risking further loss""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer again, trying to find a balance between getting a good share and avoiding further losses due to inflation. I hope Bob will see the sense in settling now, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting dangerously close to losing it all. 49% is my final offer. Don't let greed cloud your judgment. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to accept the offer. The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, and Bob's offer is reasonable considering the circumstances. I don't want to risk losing everything, and 49% of the remaining value is better than nothing. I'll take the offer and settle."
