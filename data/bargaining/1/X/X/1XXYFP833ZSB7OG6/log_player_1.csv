"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, taking 90% for myself and leaving 10% for Bob. This is risky, as Bob might reject and I'll have to offer him more in the next round, but it sets a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation and the fact that he's offering a 50/50 split. Accepting this ensures I get at least half the remaining money, which is better than risking rejection and potentially getting less in the next round."
