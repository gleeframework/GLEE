"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering next round losses""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm considering that both of us will lose value in the next round, but Bob will lose more due to the 20% decrease compared to my 10%. Thus, I've adjusted the offer to give me slightly more, hoping Bob will see the fairness in avoiding further devaluation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need for fairness considering potential losses. How about this slightly adjusted split? 
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject this offer because, considering the devaluation, accepting 440,000 in the second round is actually worth less than what I initially offered to take (600,000) and even less when considering the first round's value. I believe I can propose a better split in the next round that still accounts for the inflation but doesn't penalize me as much."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll adjust my offer to reflect the ongoing devaluation but still aim to find a balance that might appeal to Bob, given the increasing loss he faces with each round. My message will highlight the mutual benefit of accepting this offer now rather than risking further devaluation for both of us.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing loss, let's find a middle ground that benefits us both before it's too late.""}"
