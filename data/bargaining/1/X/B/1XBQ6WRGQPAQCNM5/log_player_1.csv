"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60-40 split is a fair compromise, considering the potential for inflation. This gives you a comfortable share while still acknowledging the risk we both face. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
