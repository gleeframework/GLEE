I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this deal, as he still gets a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm losing some value from inflation, Bob's offer is drastically worse than my initial proposal. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and find a middle ground.  I'm reducing my proposed gain, but offering Bob a significantly higher share than his previous offer. This should hopefully be more appealing to him, especially with inflation impacting his gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the inflation affecting his gains. While I'm losing value each round, I'm still hoping for a better split.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm trying to stay in the middle ground. While inflation is hitting me harder, I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to settle for a smaller gain now that he's seen his previous offers rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4880 
# Bob gain: 5120 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is close to a 50/50 split, which is far better than what I was offered in the previous round.  Although I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I'm willing to take this offer and end the game. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future rounds, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
