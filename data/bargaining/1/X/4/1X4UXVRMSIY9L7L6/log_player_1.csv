I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not acceptable. While it's tempting to get some money now, I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next few rounds. The inflation factor will hurt Bob more than me, and I can leverage that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a significant amount.  I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt him into accepting, especially with the increasing inflation affecting him more."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting bolder, but his offer is still too low. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm confident I can still get a better deal. I'm going to stick to my strategy of gradually increasing my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but I'm still offering Bob a decent amount. With the inflation rate accelerating, Bob is getting squeezed, and I'm hoping he'll be more receptive to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly aggressive, but his offer is still not appealing. The inflation is affecting me, but I believe I can get a better deal if I continue to hold out. I'm going to stick with my strategy of gradually increasing my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm raising my share again, hoping to entice Bob to accept. The inflation is getting significant, and it's only going to get worse.  I'm going to push for a bigger chunk now before the value of the money depreciates even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but still not enough. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm going to stick to my strategy of gradually increasing my share.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I believe I can secure a more favorable outcome if I continue to hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

The pressure is on.  The inflation is really taking its toll, but I'm still pushing for a good deal.  I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I need to make sure I get enough to make it worthwhile.  With just a few rounds left, the stakes are high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, as the inflation is hitting me very hard.  However, I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the most reasonable choice at this point."
