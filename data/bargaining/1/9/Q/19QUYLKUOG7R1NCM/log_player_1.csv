Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This time I get the larger share, but it's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
