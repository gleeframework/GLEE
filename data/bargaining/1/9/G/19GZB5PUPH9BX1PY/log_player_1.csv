"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split. I'll take $51 and you can have $49.  This way we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
