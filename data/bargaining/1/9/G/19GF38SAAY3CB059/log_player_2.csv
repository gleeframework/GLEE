"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since the value decreases for me over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a deal, especially with the threat of inflation, it's important to consider the long-term game. The inflation will significantly impact Alice's side more, making future rounds more favorable to me.  Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this round, but let's work towards a solution that's fair for both of us. We have a limited number of rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. Time is running out, and we both lose if we can't agree. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still seeing an opportunity to secure a better deal for myself. I understand the urgency, but with the inflation affecting Alice more than me, I believe I can push for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Alice.  We both need to reach an agreement soon, but I'm not sure we can both be completely happy unless we meet somewhere in the middle.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a slight concession on my part, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  We need to close this deal soon! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is improving, but it's still not a deal I'm comfortable with. I see a chance to get a better share. With each round, her losses from inflation will grow, giving me more bargaining power."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but this is my final offer.  Let's end this now before we both lose everything.""}
