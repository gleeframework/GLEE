"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! Okay, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'll be getting 300,000, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll actually be getting 240,000 in real terms. That's not bad, but I was hoping to get more.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll aim for a more aggressive split this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less, but I still want to leave some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the real value of what I'd get. The 450,000 I'd gain would be worth only about 61,200 in real terms, due to the 48.8% reduction in value.

That's not a great deal, considering the original amount was $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more aggressive. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering a smaller share to Bob, but I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth significantly less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crushing me now! The 400,000 I'd gain would be worth only about 13,200 in real terms, due to the 67.23% reduction in value.

I think I've been too aggressive in my previous offers, and Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation. I'll try to be more realistic this time.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
