"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, I'll take 60. Let's finish the game here!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation. I'll get 70% of the current value, which is 70% of 90% of $100, so I'll get $63.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is really a good deal, considering the inflation. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal. Let's finish the game here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 25% share, which is a bit lower than his previous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting desperate yet! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amount I'd get in this round:

Original $100 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273 inflation) = $72.7
80% of $72.7 = $58.16

So, I'd get approximately $58.16.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it's a decent deal considering the inflation. I'd rather take the $58.16 now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come."
