"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! Given the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than initially, so I'd better think carefully.

I'll reject this offer. The ratio is still too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more advantageous offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll need to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer. The ratio is still heavily skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really eating into my potential gain. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, but still be mindful of the diminishing returns.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}

I'm taking a risk by offering a smaller share to Bob, but I think it's necessary to try to get a better deal given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my potential gain. At this point, I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'll think about the fact that this is the last chance to get a share of the money.

I'll reject this offer. The ratio is still heavily skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share. I'll have to think carefully about what to do next.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","At this point, I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the negotiation, but I'll try to make one last offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000
}

I'm basically giving Bob the majority of the money, but I'm still trying to get something out of this. If Bob accepts, I'll consider it a decent outcome given the circumstances."
