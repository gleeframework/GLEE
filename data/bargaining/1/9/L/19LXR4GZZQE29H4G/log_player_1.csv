"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, I get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this initial offer, Alice proposes to take $60 while Bob gets $40, with a message suggesting a compromise where she gets a bit more than half. This approach tests Bob's willingness to accept a slightly uneven split from the start, potentially ending the game early in Alice's favor. The message aims to frame the offer as a reasonable compromise, encouraging Bob to consider the diminishing value of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's offer of a 45-55 split. Given that the value of the money remains the same for Alice but decreases for Bob with each round, Alice has an incentive to prolong the game, hoping that Bob will become more willing to accept a less favorable split as the rounds progress. By rejecting this offer, Alice aims to either get a better deal in the future or wait for Bob to concede more due to the pressure of the diminishing value of his potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice makes a strategic offer, slightly reducing her initial demand to $57 while still maintaining a higher share. The message aims to persuade Bob by highlighting the impact of inflation, implying that accepting this offer now would be wise given the decreasing value of the money he could gain in future rounds. By positioning this offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob under the current circumstances, Alice hopes to create a sense of urgency and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, thus ending the game in her favor."
