"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer. The division is too even, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better share.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, so I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly higher share to make up for the inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting worth less and less with each round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. 

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going into the next round with even less valuable money.
