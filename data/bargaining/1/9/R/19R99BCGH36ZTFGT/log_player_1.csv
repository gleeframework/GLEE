"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and leaving $40 for Bob. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I was hoping for a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the reduced value of the money.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still gives me a slightly larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split, but I think it's getting late and we should finalize the deal before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept the 50-50 split proposed by Bob. With the money losing value at an alarming rate, I think it's wise to finalize the deal and avoid risking further erosion of the value of the money. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to take it."
