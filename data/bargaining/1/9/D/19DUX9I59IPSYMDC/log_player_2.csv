**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster rate of inflation on my side. While her offers are getting closer to a more even split, they are still heavily skewed in her favor, especially after accounting for the lost value.  I need to push for a more significant change in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm drawing a line in the sand.  By firmly proposing a 50/50 split, I emphasize that I understand the impact of inflation and won't be swayed by her attempts to exploit it.  The ""take it or leave it"" stance adds pressure, as she risks getting a much worse deal (or nothing) as time goes on."
