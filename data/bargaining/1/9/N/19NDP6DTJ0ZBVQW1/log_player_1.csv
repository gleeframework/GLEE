  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for that. I think I can do better. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25
