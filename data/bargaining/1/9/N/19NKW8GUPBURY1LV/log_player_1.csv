"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing money each round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money with each round, so a fair split seems like the best option. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Offer:** 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface.
* **Inflation:**  The longer this goes on, the less my potential share is worth. 
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject, I'm in control of the next offer, but Bob could keep pushing for a 50/50 split knowing time is on his side.

While I could try for a slightly better deal, the risk of inflation makes this offer tempting.
