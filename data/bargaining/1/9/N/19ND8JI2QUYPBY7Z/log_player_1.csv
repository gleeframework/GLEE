"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm willing to offer Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, but I believe I deserve a bit more since I'm making the first offer. Plus, with inflation affecting Bob's side, it's better for him to accept this offer rather than risking a lower value in the next round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given the value of the money will decrease for me in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Given that the money's value remains the same for me but decreases for Bob, I believe I can negotiate for a better split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, trying to take advantage of Bob's decreasing value to get a more favorable deal. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal!""}\n\n### In this round, I'll take into account the fact that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob each round. Since we're now in Round 3, the original $1,000,000 is worth less to Bob than it was initially. Given this, I'll offer him $350,000, which, considering the inflation, is a reasonable deal for both of us. Hopefully, Bob will see it this way and accept my offer, ending the game on a mutually beneficial note."
