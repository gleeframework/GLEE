"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm starting with a relatively small amount for myself, hoping to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not willing to accept an even smaller share for myself. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that ratio, Bob. Can you do better?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money I can gain by 10% again. I'll try to make a stronger offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly higher share for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, considering the initial offer I made was 80-20. However, I also don't want to risk waiting too long and getting even less in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50-50 is the best I can get. Can you meet me at 55-45?""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, but I'm not sure if Bob will agree."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money I can gain is worth even less now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. I need a bit more to make this worth my while. Can you meet me at 60-40?""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm aware that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. This is my best offer 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.

I'm not thrilled with the 45-55 split, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob. I'm also worried that if I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to decrease, making it even harder to get a good deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, Bob. I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get under the current circumstances."
