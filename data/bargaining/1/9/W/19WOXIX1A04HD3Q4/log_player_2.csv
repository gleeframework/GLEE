# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, this is the best I'm likely to get.  Alice is correct, we're running out of time, and her offer is now barely above the 60/40 split she offered before. It's better to take a guaranteed win than risk getting nothing."
