"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the remaining 999,999 dollars in the future!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a tiny 1 dollar, and I'm keeping the rest. My message is trying to entice Bob to accept the offer by suggesting that we can split the remaining money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly since we have an equal chance to propose in each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be strategic.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Splitting it evenly seems like a fair deal, and I'll take 500,000 dollars."
