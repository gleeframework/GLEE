"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A slight advantage for me considering the faster inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think we can meet in the middle, slightly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money's value is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice, her willingness to split it evenly seems like a reasonable compromise at this point, considering the devaluation impact."
