"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting 60 since you get a 20% discount on your share every round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that my share is decreasing in value over time. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's split the money 50/50 this round.""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, hoping that Bob will see the value in a more equal division."
