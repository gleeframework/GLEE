"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'm motivated to reach a deal quickly. However, I believe I can negotiate a better split. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation!""}\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice with each passing round. Given the initial offer from Alice was a 40-60 split, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor to adjust for the inflation and to nudge the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome for me. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a fair share. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, where the money is now worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision. The compromise of a 47.5-52.5 split seems reasonable at this stage, especially since the value of the money continues to decrease with each round. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly better offer, but the loss in value due to inflation could offset any potential gains. It's time to finalize the deal and secure the remaining value."
