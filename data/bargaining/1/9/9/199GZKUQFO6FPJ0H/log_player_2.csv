"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it evenly to ensure a fair outcome. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince it's the first round and Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable proposal, I'll accept it to ensure we both get something rather than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds."
