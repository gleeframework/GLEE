"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous deal for me. I'm sure we can find a more equitable solution as the game progresses. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept such an uneven split, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split, considering the inflation, this should be fair for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer and message to Alice. I'm hoping for a reasonable response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make up for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll take this offer. The split is still not perfectly even, but considering the inflation and the fact that Alice's share is worth significantly less than in the first round, I think this is a reasonable compromise.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's conclude the game.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
