"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, this offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer. I'll accept it.
