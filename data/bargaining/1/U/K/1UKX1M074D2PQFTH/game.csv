6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I propose I take $6,000 and you take $4,000. This seems fair to me considering the inflation rate. What do you think?",Alice,1,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but inflation is working against me. I'm proposing $5200 for me and $4800 for you.  It's a better deal than you'll get in the next round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Inflation is indeed working against you. Considering that, I'm willing to take 60% and leave you with 40%. It's still a good deal for you, given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4600.0,5400.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you more than half!  If we continue, the inflation will eat away at my share even more. Let's settle this now - $4600 for me and $5400 for you.",Alice,5,
