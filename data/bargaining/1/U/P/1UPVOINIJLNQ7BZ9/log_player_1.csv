"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my target for a good deal has increased.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a larger share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, as the money will be worth even less.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take this offer and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit more persuasive, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. I think I can get more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, but the money is worth even less now. I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I'd like to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting impatient. Take this or I'll keep pushing for more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a bit more assertive, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting the deal before I make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down. You're getting closer to an even split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I need to be careful not to get stuck with too little.

Bob's offer is an even split, but considering the money's decreased value, I'd be getting less than I initially wanted. However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise given the circumstances.
