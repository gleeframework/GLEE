"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I think this is a fair split, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect me more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Considering the inflation affects Bob more, I think his offer is reasonable. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can split the $10,000 (now worth 90% of its original value) at a 40-60 ratio."
