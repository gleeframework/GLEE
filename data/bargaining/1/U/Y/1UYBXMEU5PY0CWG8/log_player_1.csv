"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with Bob taking such a large share, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a decent share too!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still trying to keep a balance between our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve a bigger cut now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offers, I'm not thrilled about this proposal. The money is worth significantly less now, and Bob's offer seems a bit too skewed towards his favor. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of money and Bob's previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the best I can do to ensure a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between my gain and Bob's, while also keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing so rapidly, I'm starting to feel the pressure. However, I still want to try to get a better deal. Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 3:7 split, even if the money is worth less. I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the urgency of the situation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to make sure I get something reasonable too. Let's finalize this!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, but I'm also aware that the value of the money is dwindling quickly."
