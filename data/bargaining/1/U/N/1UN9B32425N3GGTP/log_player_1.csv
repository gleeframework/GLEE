"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a slight adjustment to the ratio, offering you 20% of the decreasing value, but I'm willing to give you a higher percentage now to make up for it. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
