Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly.  I'll see if he's willing to take a smaller share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's likely that Bob won't make a better offer in the future. With inflation, his offer is becoming increasingly less attractive, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting. It's a fair split, and it's better than potentially getting nothing at all."
