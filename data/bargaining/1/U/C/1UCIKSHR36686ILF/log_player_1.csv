"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'm inclined to accept his offer. I'll choose:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
