Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my previous offer. 60/40 is still a good deal, especially since the value decreases for you each round. Let's be practical and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Round 4
