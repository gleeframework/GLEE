Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're feeling the pinch of inflation, I'll give you a little more than before, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my diminishing returns. While she's inching the offer up, it's not at a pace that makes up for the inflation I'm experiencing.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, or she'll keep lowballing me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation's impact. Time is running out!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases for me, making a deal increasingly urgent.
* **Concession:**  I'm conceding slightly from a 50/50 split to show a willingness to negotiate and avoid reaching a no-deal scenario. 
* **Urgency:** My message emphasizes the time constraint and the need for Alice to accept a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, but I'll only give you a tiny bit more. Take it before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While the offer isn't ideal, consider:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of the money is plummeting for me. Every round that passes means significantly less potential gain. 
* **Alice's Stance:** She's clearly aware of her advantage and seems unwilling to budge much.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in the next round or two isn't worth the risk of getting nothing at all if we fail to reach an agreement. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting now secures me something rather than risking a complete loss."
