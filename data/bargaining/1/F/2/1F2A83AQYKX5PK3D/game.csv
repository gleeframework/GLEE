6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to go for a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. You can't expect a 60/40 split when we're starting from scratch!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Okay, I understand your point about the 60/40 split. Let's try a 54/46 split. I'm willing to be flexible, but I think a 20% difference is still too much.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I'm not willing to give up too much more. I think a 7/3 split is a fair compromise, considering the starting point. You can't expect me to give you the majority of the money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4860.0,5140.0,"I'm willing to compromise further, but a 7/3 split is still too much. I'm proposing a 48/52 split. This seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that we're both losing money with each round.",Alice,5,
