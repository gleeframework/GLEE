"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty lopsided offer! I'd rather not accept it. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was skewed towards him, I'll try to counter with a more balanced offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly higher share, but it's still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50-50 split, but it's still slightly in his favor. I'm not ready to accept it yet.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was still slightly in his favor, I'll try to push for a more equal split. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than 50%, but it's still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50-50 split, but it's still in his favor. I'm starting to think he's trying to squeeze out a bit more than his fair share.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive move to get a better deal. Since Bob has been offering me lower and lower shares, I'll try to take a bigger chunk this time. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'm taking a significant lead, but it's still within the bounds of reason. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting more and more skewed towards him, and it's clear he's trying to get the majority of the money. I'm not going to let that happen!

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's getting intense! Since Bob's offers have been getting progressively more one-sided, I'll try to make a bold move to take control of the negotiations. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'm taking a significant lead, and it's a take-it-or-leave-it offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous! Bob's offers are getting more and more extreme, and it's clear he's trying to take advantage of me. I'm not going to let him get away with it!

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's getting down to the wire! Since Bob's offers have been getting progressively more one-sided, I'll try to make a final, aggressive move to take the majority of the money. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I'm taking a huge lead, and it's a take-it-or-leave-it offer. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to accept his next offer, and I'm not sure I want to do that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round! Bob's offer is an insult, and I'm not going to accept it. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this ridiculous offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I guess we'll have to split the difference, which is nothing. Better luck next time, Bob!"
