"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a relatively small amount, and keeping 80% for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original amount, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about meeting in the middle, as it would put me at a disadvantage. However, it's a relatively fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower value of money.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
