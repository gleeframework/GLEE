"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it down the middle.  It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can still afford to be generous. And Bob's offer is a very fair one, splitting the money evenly.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
