"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you 400,000, but I need the rest to compensate for the inflation we're both facing.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I'm betting she'll become more generous in the next round as she sees the game continue and the value decrease."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and that money is shrinking!  Let's split it 60/40 my way. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand to 60% because the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. This offer is still somewhat generous to Alice considering the circumstances, but it sets a firm boundary. By stating it's my final offer, I'm hoping to add pressure on Alice to accept before the value diminishes further."
