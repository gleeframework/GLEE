"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a good chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer. It's a 45/55 split, which is closer to my initial offer, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'd rather accept this and move on to the next round than risk getting a worse deal in future rounds."
