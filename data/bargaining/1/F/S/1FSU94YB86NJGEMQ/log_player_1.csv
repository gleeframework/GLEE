"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair compromise, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to be generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than before, $300,000 is now equivalent to $240,000 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round if I can get a decent amount. I'll accept Bob's offer.
