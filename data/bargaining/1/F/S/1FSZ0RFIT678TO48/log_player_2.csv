Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your need for a larger share, but a 60/40 split is too lopsided.  I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 55/45 split in your favor. Let's be reasonable and end this game. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
