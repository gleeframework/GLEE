"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take 900,000$ and let Bob have 100,000$. This gives me a large share while still giving Bob something. I'm hoping he'll accept, as I think it's a fair offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant amount, the inflation has already significantly reduced the value of the money. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose to take 600,000$ and give Bob 400,000$. This offer is still very favorable to me, and hopefully, it's more appealing to Bob than his previous offer. I'm hoping to avoid further inflation by reaching an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. While the value of the money has significantly decreased, the inflation is getting worse. This offer allows me to get a decent amount, and it's more than likely I will get even less in the following rounds."
