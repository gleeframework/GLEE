"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's really taking the risk here! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I'd be getting only $3,000, which is a significant decrease from the initial $5,000 I proposed. I'd like to negotiate further or try to come up with a new proposal that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm trying to make a more competitive offer, giving Bob a smaller share of the pie, but still leaving me with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still not convinced this is the best deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, as I'd still be getting a relatively small share of the pie. Considering the inflation, I'm losing purchasing power rapidly, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, giving myself a slightly larger share of the pie, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Considering the rapid decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. At this point, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, and $5,500 is still a decent amount, even with the reduced purchasing power. I'll take what I can get and hope that Bob will be satisfied with the outcome."
