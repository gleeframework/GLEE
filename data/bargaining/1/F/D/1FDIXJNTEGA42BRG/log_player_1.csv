Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this offer is good enough for me. I was hoping for a more even split, especially considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it evenly. Let's call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a fair offer, considering the inflation and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while. Splitting it evenly at $50 each seems like a good compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
