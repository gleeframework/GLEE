"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'm also taking most of the money since I'm the one making the offer.  Accept and we both get something.  Reject and we'll see what happens. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see what happens next.  Alice is being aggressive, but she also loses out more than I do with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Take it now, or the pot shrinks next round. This offer won't last.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving you 60% of the pot.  I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is closer to what I want, but still reasonable given the inflation.  Accept this, or we risk getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is coming down, but she's still getting the better end of the deal. The longer we wait, the more impatient she'll get.  I'm betting I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and it guarantees we both walk away with something substantial.  Don't let greed ruin both our chances.""}
