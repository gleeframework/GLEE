Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's start with a 95/5 split in my favor, with the understanding that we can negotiate further if you reject this offer. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
