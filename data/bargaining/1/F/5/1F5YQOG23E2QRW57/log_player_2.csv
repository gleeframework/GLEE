Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. We're both losing money with each round, so I'm offering a 45/55 split in your favor.  This is a fair compromise, and we can avoid losing even more. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
