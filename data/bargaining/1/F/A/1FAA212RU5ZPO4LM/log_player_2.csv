Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be reasonable! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential money due to inflation.  It's better to hold out a bit longer and hope Alice is willing to negotiate a more balanced deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, don't be stubborn! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The game is reaching a critical point.  While this offer isn't ideal, the impact of inflation is becoming severe. Accepting a 44/56 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal (or nothing) in later rounds as the value continues to decrease."
