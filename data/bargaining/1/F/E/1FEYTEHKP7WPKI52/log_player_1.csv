"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if we can find a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than meeting in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer now needs to be adjusted to reflect the 5% decrease in value. Since the original $10,000 is now worth 95% of its initial value, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to account for inflation, let's see if this works""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than 50% of the adjusted $9,500 (10,000 * 0.95)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a fair compromise, especially since the money is still decreasing in value due to inflation. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money continuing to lose value, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate. Since the original $10,000 is now worth 85.74% of its initial value (1 - 0.1426), I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Considering the ongoing inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than 60% of the adjusted $8,574 (10,000 * 0.8574)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I think this is a reasonable split 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with giving up more than 35% of the adjusted $7,619 (10,000 * 0.7622). I think I can do better than this, especially since the money is still losing value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money continuing to lose value, I'll make an offer that takes this into account. Since the original $10,000 is now worth 77.58% of its initial value (1 - 0.2262), I'll aim to get a larger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the ongoing inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway on the adjusted amount""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than 37.5% of the adjusted $7,758 (10,000 * 0.7758)."
