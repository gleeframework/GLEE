"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about a 60/40 split, but it doesn't fully account for the rapid inflation affecting my share. I'm proposing a 55/45 split as a compromise.  This ensures a fairer deal for both of us in the long run. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
