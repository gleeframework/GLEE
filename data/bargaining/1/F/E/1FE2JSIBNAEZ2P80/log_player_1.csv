"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a solid foundation""}

I'm offering Bob a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000. I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about meeting in the middle, as I was hoping to get a better share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm offering Bob a 45% share of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $450,000. I'll take the remaining 55%, which is $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway again 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the decreasing value of the money, but I think this offer is a decent compromise. Meeting halfway again and getting a 52% share of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $520,000, seems like a reasonable deal. I'll accept this offer."
