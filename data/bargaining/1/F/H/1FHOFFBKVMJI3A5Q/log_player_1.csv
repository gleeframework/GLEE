"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I get a decent share of the money, but Bob still gets a significant amount, so he might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the ratio of the split is still 60:40, I'll accept this offer.
