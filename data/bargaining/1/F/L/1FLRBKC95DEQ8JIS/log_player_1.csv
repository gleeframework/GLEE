"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60:40 split is a more equitable way to divide the money.  This gives me a bit more, but it's still a fair share for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
