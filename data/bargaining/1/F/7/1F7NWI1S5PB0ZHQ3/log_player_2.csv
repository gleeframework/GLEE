"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""My turn! Let's split closer to the middle, but still in my favor since I have the next turn's advantage.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer was essential.**  A 40/60 split heavily favors Alice, especially since she got to propose first.
* **A 55/45 split is strong.** It's closer to an even split, which is fairer, but still gives me a slight advantage.
* **Highlighting the next round is strategic.**  Alice knows the money loses value each round. By pointing out that I'd have the proposal advantage in round 3 (if we get there), it might pressure her to accept a slightly less favorable deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, still generous 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is starting to bite.** While Alice's offer is slightly better than her first one, it's still heavily in her favor, especially considering the money is now worth less. 
* **Holding firm might pay off.** Alice is clearly aiming for a  favorable deal. My continued rejection might push her to a more reasonable split in the next round, especially as the clock is ticking on the money's value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Time for a reality check!  The money is rapidly losing value. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution now before we both lose out.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time for a bold move.**  Two rounds of back-and-forth with declining offers suggests Alice is playing hardball, but the shrinking pot changes the game.
* **50/50 becomes the power play.**  It's no longer just about a slight advantage.  A fair split is now the most logical to avoid significant losses from inflation.
* **The message is crucial.**  By framing it as a ""reality check"" and emphasizing the loss we both face, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept before the deal gets even worse for both of us."
