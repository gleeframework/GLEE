I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a reasonable 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $600,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split this 60/40, considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:\n\n```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

I've taken into account the effect of inflation on both of us and made a compromise offer. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
