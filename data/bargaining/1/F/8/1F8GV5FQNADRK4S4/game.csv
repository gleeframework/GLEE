60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I get $60, you get $40. Deal?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't need to risk losing anything due to the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, this is already round 3. My offer is getting worse with each round because of the inflation.  Let's be reasonable: $55 for me and $45 for you. It's still more than what you would have gotten in the last round!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, we're getting closer to the end of the game. It's time to be realistic. I'm offering 70/30, which is still a fair split considering the inflation. Accept this, and we both walk away with something.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it down the middle: $50 for me, $50 for you.  It's the only fair option at this point, and it'll save us both from losing everything!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, the inflation is starting to affect us both significantly. This is my final offer - 80/20. If you reject it, we risk losing everything. Let's be reasonable and end this game with a positive outcome for both of us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is getting smaller and smaller. This is my compromise - $45 for me and $55 for you. It's significantly more than what I'll be able to offer in later rounds. Let's be smart and end this.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
10.0,90.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer: 90/10. It's a tough one, but considering the inflation, it's the best we can both get at this point. Let's be smart and accept this, or we risk getting nothing at all.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,accept
