I'm going to start with a 60/40 split in my favor. This should be a good starting point, giving me a decent share while leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original offer. The inflation has decreased my share, but not enough to justify accepting a worse deal. I'll reject and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm going to try to compromise a bit. With inflation, my previous offer is worth less for me now.  I'm willing to lower my share slightly to 5500, but I still want a majority.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a more even split."
