"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While it seems like a lot of money now, the inflation will hit Alice much harder than me. It's worth seeing what kind of offer I can get in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this is more equitable considering the inflation. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less, but still think I deserve the larger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is finally acknowledging the inflation, but her offer is still not good for me.  She's hoping I'll panic as we get closer to the deadline. I need to hold firm and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a fair deal that accounts for the inflation. Let's be reasonable and close this out.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our previous offers, let's make a deal before the money is worthless 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tempting offer, as it's the best one I've received so far. However, it's still not in my best interest. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is trying to get me to settle. I think I can squeeze a slightly better deal out of her if I hold out for one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal. The inflation is eating away at the value, and we're both losing with every passing round. Let's be smart and take the win-win.""
