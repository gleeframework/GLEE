"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 90 and Bob taking 10. This seems like a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation would make my next offer worth less, and there's no guarantee Bob will be generous in subsequent rounds."
