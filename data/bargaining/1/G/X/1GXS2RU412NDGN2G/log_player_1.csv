"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take $99 for myself and leave $1 for Bob. It's a risky move, but I believe it's the best way to maximize my potential gains, especially considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with a 50/50 split, given the potential for inflation to hurt Bob's future offers, accepting this seems like the safest option.  It's better to get something now than risk getting nothing later."
