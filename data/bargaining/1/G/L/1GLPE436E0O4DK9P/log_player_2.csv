Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my new offer is a bit more generous. Take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hitting her harder than me, so she's getting more motivated. I'll hold out for a bit longer to see if I can get closer to an even split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. Inflation is hurting me more! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point. Accepting a 45/55 split now guarantees me a reasonable amount, whereas continuing to hold out risks getting a much smaller share (or nothing) as inflation continues to erode the value."
