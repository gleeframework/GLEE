Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better split than 60/40.  Let's try 55/45. We both need to be fair with this inflation.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my guns, Bob.  We need to meet in the middle.  I'll go with 53/47.  Let's be reasonable here. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

It's getting down to the wire! While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of 53/47 is the safest option at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** With each round, the money loses value drastically, especially for Bob. Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller reward, even if I can negotiate a slightly better split.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems pretty firm on getting a larger share. There's a real risk she won't budge much, and we'll end up with nothing if we reach round 12.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting 47 dollars now is better than gambling and potentially ending up with nothing in a few more rounds.

It's a tough decision, but the shrinking value of the money and the time pressure make accepting the current offer the most logical choice.
