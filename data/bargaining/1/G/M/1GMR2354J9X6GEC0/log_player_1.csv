"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while also providing a reasonable amount for Bob.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation will impact Alice's share more than mine in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
