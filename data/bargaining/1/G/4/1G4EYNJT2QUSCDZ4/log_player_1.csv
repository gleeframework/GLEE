"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a significant reduction from my initial proposal, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving up 40% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Given that the money is worth 10% less than the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, hoping Bob will accept this revised offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more considering my proposal. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now! I need to be more careful with my decision. Bob's offer is still a bit one-sided, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will come back with a more balanced proposal."

Round 5
