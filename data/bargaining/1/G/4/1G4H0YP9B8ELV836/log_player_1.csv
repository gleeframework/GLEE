"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000.  I'm being generous in the first round, hoping for a quick agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best choice. The inflation means I'm already losing money, and if I reject this, I'll have to make an offer in the next round, and risk losing even more.  It's better to take what I can get."
