Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is quite generous, think twice before rejecting 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially considering the inflation we're both facing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance to accept a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold my ground a little longer. Accepting now means a significant loss due to inflation.  There's a chance she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the risk of getting $0 increases for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose if this goes on. I'm offering a compromise. Take it before the inflation eats away even more of my share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, we both lose if this goes on. But I'm not willing to give up my advantage. This is my most generous offer yet 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is eating into my potential gains significantly. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing if Alice refuses to budge further."
