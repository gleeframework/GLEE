"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to accept a smaller share due to the 10% decrease in the value of the money I gain.
