"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but it's a good starting point. If he accepts, we can end the game and I'll get to keep 90% of the original 100$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for a better deal. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 40% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a decent share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly better share than Bob's previous offer, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I think I can do better. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up more than I did in my previous offer, considering the continued decrease in the value of the money. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still holding out for a decent share. Last chance?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, but I'm still hoping to get a reasonable share of the remaining value."
