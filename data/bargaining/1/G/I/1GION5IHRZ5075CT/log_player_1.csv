"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. This offer is fair, but I'd like to see if we can both get a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's message sounds conciliatory, his offer is heavily skewed in his favor.  It's worse than my initial offer, especially considering the inflation working against me. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is a compromise considering the time pressure.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My previous offer was 60/40, Bob countered with a worse 40/60. This 55/45 split is a compromise, moving closer to the middle ground.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm emphasizing that the value of the money is decreasing with each round. This should push Bob towards a quicker agreement. 
* **Bob's Declining Position:**  Bob's gains are hit harder by inflation. He loses 20% per round, making my current offer more appealing than it might seem at first glance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a little more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's split the difference. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is working heavily against me now. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer ensures I at least get something out of this deal. 
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. Holding out for a significantly better deal in the few remaining rounds is too risky.  
* **Certainty over Unknown:** Accepting now guarantees a specific amount, whereas continuing the game has increasingly uncertain outcomes. It's better to secure a decent amount than risk getting even less later."
