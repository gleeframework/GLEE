Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll try 57-43, but I'm getting anxious about the inflation. Let's settle soon! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, but she's still offering me less than what I proposed in round 4. I'm holding out for a better deal, knowing that the decreasing value will make her more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 530000,
""alice_gain"": 470000,
""message"": ""Alice, I sense your anxiety about the inflation. This is my final offer: 53/47.  It's a fair deal given the circumstances and the limited time we have left.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept a deal. 
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my demand slightly from 52/48 to 53/47 to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Highlighting Time Pressure:**  Reminding Alice of the dwindling time and shrinking value adds weight to the offer."
