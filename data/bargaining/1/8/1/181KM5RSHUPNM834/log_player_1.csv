"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 5% less, so I'm now looking at a $570,000 gain if I accept this offer.

I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, considering the initial proposal I made was a 60-40 split. However, I don't want to risk going back to the negotiating table, so I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
