"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both have a decent starting point, and Bob can try to negotiate for more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get a more balanced split. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $5,000 and Bob will take $5,000. It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money."
