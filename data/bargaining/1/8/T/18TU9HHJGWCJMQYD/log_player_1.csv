"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
 
I propose to take 6000 dollars and leave 4000 dollars for Bob. This is a fair initial split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred my original offer, Bob's offer is reasonable given the inflation. Accepting will guarantee me $5000, which is better than risking further rounds and potential for lower gains."
