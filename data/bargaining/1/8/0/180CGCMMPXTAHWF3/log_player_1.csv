Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decreasing value for you, I'm willing to take a bit more. Let's do 57/43. It's getting closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more since the money is worth the same to me.

# Bob gain: 57

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is becoming the less risky option. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round that passes, the value of the money decreases significantly for me (Alice). Waiting for a potentially ""better"" offer in later rounds means risking a much smaller gain overall.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is aware of the inflation working against me and is unlikely to offer significantly more than this, especially as he incurs no penalty for waiting. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better split (e.g., 58/42) carries the risk of Bob offering even less in future rounds, making this 57/43 split the most reasonable compromise at this point."
