"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, offering Bob a relatively small share this round to see if he'll accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you'll have to take the smaller share this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer and respond with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll take a slightly smaller share this time""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a compromise that's closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, I'm not giving you a better deal than I got from you last round! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was hoping for a better deal, especially considering the inflation has made his share worth even less. I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split when I was previously offered a 55-45 split. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm not going below 60%""
}
```

I'm trying to regain some ground and push for a 60-40 split, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept a smaller share this time."
