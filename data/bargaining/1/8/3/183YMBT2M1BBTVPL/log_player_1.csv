"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This gives me a large share while still giving Bob something.  I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of losing even more in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much better than what I proposed in round 1, so I'm going to reject it and see if I can get an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. I'm offering $7,000 for myself, which is more than what he offered me, but less than what I originally wanted. Hopefully, this will be appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has been significant, this offer gives me a decent amount of money and ensures that I don't risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds. It's also an equitable split for both of us, which makes it appealing."
