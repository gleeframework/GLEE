I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I get slightly less than my initial proposal, it's still a good deal considering the inflation.  It's better to get something than to risk getting nothing in later rounds."
