"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money 60/40, but I think we can both do better in the long run.  Let's talk. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

My gain would be $400,000, but that's equivalent to $380,000 in the original amount, considering the 5% inflation.

I'm not convinced by Bob's message, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. I'll aim to get a bit more than what I would have gotten in the previous round, considering the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more for my part in this negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $420,000 and Bob gets $580,000."
