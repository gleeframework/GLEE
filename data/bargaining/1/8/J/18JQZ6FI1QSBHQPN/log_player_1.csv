"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This is a compromise, as I am losing value faster than you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and we both lose if this fails. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While the pressure is on, Bob's offer is still not advantageous. Accepting 5200 now is barely better than getting nothing if the game fails. There's a good chance Bob will be more willing to compromise in the next round as the deadline approaches and he risks getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic. We're getting close to the deadline. I'll meet you in the middle â€“ this is a fair deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing significantly increases.  It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Middle ground:** This offer represents a compromise and moves closer to Bob's previous offer. 
* **Fairness:** While Alice is losing value due to inflation,  this offer ensures she still receives a reasonable share, and emphasizes the fairness for both sides."
