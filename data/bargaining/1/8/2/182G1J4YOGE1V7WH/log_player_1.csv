"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. My message is a friendly suggestion to start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both have a chance to propose. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the 10% reduction in value, I'll have to reassess the offer. With the 10% decrease, my gain of 45 dollars is actually worth 40.5 dollars (100 - 10% of 100 = 90, then 45 * 0.9 = 40.5).

I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I'm willing to accept it for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
