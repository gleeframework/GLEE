"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40.  We can work out a better deal later if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's a good starting point, but I think I can do better, especially since the money will be worth less to Alice in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think it's fair that I get the larger share since the money will be worth less to you in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I'm not sure what the future holds, but this feels fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Alice's offer.  Even with the inflation, getting 50% is a decent outcome, and there's always the risk that I could get nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
