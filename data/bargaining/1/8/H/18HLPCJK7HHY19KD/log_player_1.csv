"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair starting point, and leaves $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Let's see if you'll accept this one. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

Alice's gain is 6000, which is 60% of the new total value of $10,000 after inflation. That's a good offer, but I'd like to see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to get a better share of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This offer gives me 72% of the new total value of $8,000 (after two rounds of inflation), which is a bit more than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price. Let's see if this one sticks. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the new total value of the money after three rounds of inflation:

Original $10,000 → $8,000 (20% decrease) → $6,400 (20% decrease) → $3,232 (20% decrease)

Now, let's consider Bob's offer:

Alice's gain is $7,000, which is 216% of the new total value of $3,232. That's a very generous offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to get a better share of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve more.""
}
```

This offer gives me 264% of the new total value of $3,232, which is a bit more than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. Let's see if you'll take this one. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the new total value of the money after six rounds of inflation:

Original $10,000 → $8,000 (20% decrease) → $6,400 (20% decrease) → $5,120 (20% decrease) → $4,096 (20% decrease) → $2,073.28 (20% decrease)

Now, let's consider Bob's offer:

Alice's gain is $7,500, which is 362% of the new total value of $2,073.28. This is a generous offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

However, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I think I should accept this offer to get as much as I can.
