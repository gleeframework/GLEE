"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. I'll take the remaining $6,000, which is a decent share considering we have 11 more rounds to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

In this round, the money I gain would be worth 90% of $6,000 (my original offer), which is $5,400. Bob's offer is $4,000, which is a better deal for me now.

I accept Bob's offer.
