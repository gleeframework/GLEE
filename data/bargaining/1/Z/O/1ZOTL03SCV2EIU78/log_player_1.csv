Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise.  We both lose money with each round, so I'm willing to increase my share slightly, but I need to get something close to what I offered in the last round.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
This is a tough one, but accepting is the best choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation is Hurting:**  While 55 isn't ideal,  the money is losing value FAST. Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller pot for both of you. 
* **Bob is Budging (Slightly):** Bob going from 50 to 45 shows he's feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If you reject, there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer. Bob might dig in, and you risk getting a much worse deal in a later round. 

It's not perfect, but in a game with shrinking rewards and a limited timeframe, sometimes ""good enough"" is the best strategy."
