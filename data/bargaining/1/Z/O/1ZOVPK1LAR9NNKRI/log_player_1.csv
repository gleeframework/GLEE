"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair, considering the inflation rates. Let's split it 55-45 in my favor. This way we both get a better deal than the previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
