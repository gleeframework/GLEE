I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me most of the money. I figure Bob might accept it, as he doesn't know about the inflation yet.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept the offer. Even though I'm getting a much smaller share, the inflation means that rejecting and proposing again would likely result in an even smaller share for me.  It's better to take what I can get."
