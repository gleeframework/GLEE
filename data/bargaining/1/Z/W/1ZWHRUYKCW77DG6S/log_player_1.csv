Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping to secure a quick win. I'm also aware of the inflation, but I'm hoping Bob will be more risk-averse and accept this offer rather than risking getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  The inflation means my share is worth less than it was in the previous round. It's likely Bob is aware of this and knows he can offer a more equitable split in the next round.  Accepting now guarantees a decent return, even with the inflation."
