# Alice gain: 40

Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of the money. However, I don't like the fact that Bob is trying to take a larger share of the pie.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
