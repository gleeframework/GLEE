"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers.""}\n\n###\n\nNote that due to inflation, the $58 I'm offering for myself is now worth less than it would have been in the first round.
