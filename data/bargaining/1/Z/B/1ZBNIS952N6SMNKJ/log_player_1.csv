"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a bit more since I'm the first to propose.""
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking $6,000 and Bob taking $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'll still give you a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $2,000 is actually worth 80% of its original value, which is $1,600.

I'm not too thrilled with the 20-80 split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not go to another round if I can get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer for now.
