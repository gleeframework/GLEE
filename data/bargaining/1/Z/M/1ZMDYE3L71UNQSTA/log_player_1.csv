"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly invitation to accept the offer and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The money is worth less now, but I still want a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less after the second round, the total amount is now $8,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want the majority. Accept or reject?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. The message is a challenge to see if Bob will accept this new offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and we can finally end this game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable offer, especially considering the money is worth less and less with each round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game. A 50/50 split seems like a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting it."
