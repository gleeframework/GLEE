"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer gives Alice 60% of the money, which seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation rates will benefit her more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500} 
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, as inflation is now working in my favor. This offer still gives Bob a decent amount, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth significantly less now, the offer is still better than what I could potentially get in future rounds. Accepting guarantees me something, and the inflation is working against me at this point."
