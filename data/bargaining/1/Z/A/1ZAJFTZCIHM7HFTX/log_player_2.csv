Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold my ground a bit longer.  The inflation is working in my favor. While her offer is slightly better than the last, if I reject it, I can put even more pressure on her in the next round."

Round 6

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was close, but not quite there 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of my potential gains is eroding rapidly. Waiting any longer will significantly decrease my final amount, even if I manage to secure a slightly better split.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aiming to maximize her share and is willing to play a long game. She's unlikely to accept a deal where I get significantly more than this offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of walking away with nothing is increasing with each round. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout, even if it's not the 50/50 split I was aiming for."
