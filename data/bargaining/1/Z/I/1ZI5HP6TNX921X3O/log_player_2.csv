Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, a 50/50 split sounds fair in principle, but doesn't factor in the faster rate of inflation affecting me. This is a compromise, and a final one. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the faster inflation, but this offer is still too skewed in her favor. While a 50/50 split is ideal, it's unlikely Alice will agree to it given her situation. I'll push for a slightly better deal in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, your point about the inflation difference is valid. This offer recognizes that while still aiming for a quick and mutually beneficial resolution.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer aims to find a middle ground. It acknowledges the impact of the different inflation rates on Alice while still securing a slightly better deal for Bob than her previous offer.  It also conveys a sense of urgency to encourage Alice to accept before the pot shrinks further."
