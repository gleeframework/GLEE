Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share. I can offer you 3000 now, but it's better than getting less in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""I'm trying to be reasonable here, Bob. This is the most I can offer while still keeping something for myself.  If we don't reach an agreement, I'll get even less in the next round.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice. Inflation is crippling your share. This is the best offer you'll get from me. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a tough call, but with inflation, Alice's share is rapidly declining. Accepting the offer will ensure she gets something, even if it's a lot less than she initially wanted. There's a real risk of getting nothing if she keeps rejecting and the next round brings even lower gains."
