I'm Bob, and that offer is way too unfair.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be more flexible. Let's split it 90/10.  We both have a chance to do better in the next round, but let's be practical and secure a good share now. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll take it.  That's a much better deal for me.  Let's move on."
