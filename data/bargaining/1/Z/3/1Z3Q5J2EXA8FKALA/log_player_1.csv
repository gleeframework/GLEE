"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, it's a fair split!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but you're still getting the majority 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $70 is actually worth 10% less than the $60 I could have gotten in the first round, which is $54. And Bob's gain of $30 is worth 20% less than the $40 he could have gotten in the first round, which is $24.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept this offer.
