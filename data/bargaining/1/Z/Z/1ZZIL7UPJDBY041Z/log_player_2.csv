**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, hoping I'll crack under the pressure of inflation.  However, accepting this offer would still give me significantly less than half the (rapidly shrinking) pot. It's time to show I'm serious about getting a better deal and won't be pressured into accepting a bad one."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is more than fair. Take it before inflation eats away any more of our potential winnings.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm nudging my offer slightly closer to Alice's terms to signal that I am willing to compromise, but I'm keeping the pressure on with the time constraint and inflation warning.  This offer is still advantageous to me, and the rapidly decreasing value of the money should encourage Alice to accept."
