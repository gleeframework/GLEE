Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice, especially considering the faster rate of inflation impacting my share. I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to secure a larger share, even with her slower inflation rate.  While her offer is closer to a reasonable split, I need to push for a better deal in the next round. The shrinking pot is making things urgent."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, and our potential gains are shrinking. This is a fair offer considering the inflation, let's seal the deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value, let's meet closer to the middle before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is still not ideal, but the relentless inflation is eating into the potential gains. Accepting now secures a reasonable sum, even though it's less than what I aimed for initially. It's better than risking further devaluation or walking away with nothing."
