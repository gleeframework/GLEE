Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's important we settle this now before the devaluation hurts us both further. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Declining Leads to Worse Outcomes:** If I reject this offer, the value of the money decreases further for both of us. In the next round, even if I could secure a slightly better split, the impact of the devaluation would likely offset any potential gains. 
* **Bob's Offer Is Becoming More Reasonable (Relatively):**  While Bob's initial offers were heavily skewed in his favor, the devaluation hurts him more than me. His willingness to move closer to a 50/50 split suggests he's feeling the pressure.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a specific amount. Holding out for a potentially better deal in later rounds comes with the increasing risk of ending up with even less.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4, while not perfect, mitigates losses due to devaluation and provides a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
