"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'm not as generous as I was in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about Bob's new offer.

After considering the proposal, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money, even with the inflation effect. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my offer will be worth even less than before. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests. Let's see what Bob says next!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of you 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! Considering the significant drop in value, I'm getting a bit more cautious. However, I'm still not willing to give up 70% of the money.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more reasonable offer next time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much more!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money, considering the inflation effect. I'm hoping Bob will meet me in the middle!"
