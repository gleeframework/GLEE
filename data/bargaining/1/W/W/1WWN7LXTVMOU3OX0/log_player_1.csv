Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's getting the better deal, but I'm not so sure. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.
