Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. This offer is more fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's analyze why this is a good move:

* **Current Offer:** Bob offers $4000 for Alice and $6000 for himself. Due to inflation, Alice effectively receives only $3200 ($4000 - 20%). 
* **Future Potential:** If Alice rejects this offer, she gets to propose in the next round. While the pot will shrink further for her, she can aim for a more favorable split that compensates for the inflation.

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, Alice signals to Bob that she's not settling for a bad deal. This increases the pressure on Bob to offer a larger share in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out!  This is my final offer, let's close the deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** By stating it's a final offer,  we create a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to accept before the value decreases further.
* **Inflation:**  While the offer seems tilted in Alice's favor, we have to consider the rapid 20% inflation per round. This offer aims to secure a reasonable amount for Alice before the money devalues significantly. 
* **Slight Advantage:** The offer is slightly better for Bob than his previous one (considering the inflation for Alice), making it more likely for him to accept."
