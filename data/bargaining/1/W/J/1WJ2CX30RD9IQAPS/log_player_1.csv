"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreased value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering a 52-48 split, which should give me a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreased value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! Considering the decreased value of the money, I'll need to reassess my strategy. Since Bob's offer is a 51-49 split, which is a relatively close split, I'll consider accepting it to avoid further negotiations.
