"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a straightforward proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I'll still consider the offer. Since Bob's offer is equal, it's a 50-50 split, which is reasonable considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.
