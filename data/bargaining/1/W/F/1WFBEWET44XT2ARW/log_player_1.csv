I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a larger share, this is a fair offer considering the inflation. I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
