"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a split of 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob. This gives Bob a small portion but still a chance to gain something. It also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 800,000, but still offering Bob a significant portion.  It's important to remember that both of us are losing value with each passing round, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but still offering Bob a decent portion to incentivize acceptance.  It's getting more and more risky to wait, as the inflation is taking a serious toll on the value of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm still rejecting. While the offer is tempting, it's still far below what I believe I deserve, especially given the rapid rate of inflation. It's important to stick to my principles and try to achieve a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my share to 600,000, but still offering Bob a significant 400,000. Time is running out, and the value of the money is dropping rapidly.  We need to reach an agreement soon or both of us will lose everything."
