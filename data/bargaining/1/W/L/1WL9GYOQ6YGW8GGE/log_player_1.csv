I'm going for a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money. I'll see how Bob responds.  Let's see if he's willing to accept a small share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm tempted by the $1,000, the inflation effect means I'm likely to get a better deal in the future rounds. I'll hold out for a more equitable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to reduce my initial demand a bit, but still aiming for a significant share. I'm hoping Bob will see that this offer is more reasonable than his previous one, considering the inflation effect on his side."
