# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to catch up with Bob, but he's still trying to negotiate a good deal.

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob, I should be willing to give him a slightly smaller share to make up for it.

However, I'd rather not give him 55% of the remaining money. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of the increasing inflation to get a better deal.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to make up for the lost value with a larger share this time. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share! I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 40.95% less for Bob, I'd expect him to offer a larger share to make up for it. However, I'm not sure if 60% is enough to compensate for the lost value.

I'll consider the fact that I'll get a smaller share, but I'll also get to keep more of the remaining money in future rounds.

I'll consider the fact that I'll get a smaller share, but I'll also get to keep more of the remaining money in future rounds.

However, I'm starting to think that I should accept this offer, since the inflation is making Bob's share worth less and less with each round. I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in future rounds.
