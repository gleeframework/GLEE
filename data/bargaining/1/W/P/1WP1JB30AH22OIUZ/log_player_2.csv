# Alice's message: I'm still not giving up, let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but this offer is still not in Bob's favor.  We're getting closer to a point where Alice will be forced to make a more serious concession."

# Alice's message: I'll meet you at half, it's now or never for me 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  It's finally happened! The impact of inflation has forced Alice to agree to an even split. While Bob might have held out for a slightly larger share earlier, this is the best offer he's likely to get now. Accepting guarantees both players get something."
