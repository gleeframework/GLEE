I'll take a big chunk, but give Bob something to start. Let's see if he's happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game!  I'm going to reject this offer.  I know that if I reject it, I get to make an offer in the next round and can likely get a better deal than 1000, even with inflation.  Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly less aggressive offer this time. While I want to get as much as possible, I'm starting to think that Bob might be playing the long game too. Let's see if this is more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 3000 is better than the 1000 I got offered last round, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  The inflation is hurting me, but Bob seems to be playing hardball.  I'm going to push for a more even split!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway here. I'm losing a lot to inflation, so I need to get a good deal, but I also don't want to risk him rejecting this and getting nothing in the final rounds.  Let's see how he reacts!"
