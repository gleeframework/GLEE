I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm being conservative. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and the inflation on his side is less than mine.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I counter."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm adjusting my offer to account for inflation and Bob's potential willingness to negotiate.  This time, I'm offering 81% for myself and 19% for Bob. Let's see if this is more appealing to him."
