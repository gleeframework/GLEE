Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The inflation is hurting us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of money, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable option at this point. Further negotiations may lead to more losses due to inflation, so I'll accept this offer to secure my share."
