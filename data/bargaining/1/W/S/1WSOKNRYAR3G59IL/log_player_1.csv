Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, sorry Bob!""
}
```

I'm making a bold move to start, hoping Bob will be willing to accept and we can end the game quickly!"

I accept the offer. Here's my response:
