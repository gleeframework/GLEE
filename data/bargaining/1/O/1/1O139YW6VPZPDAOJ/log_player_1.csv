"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, considering we both have to account for inflation. Accept this, and we can avoid further haggling. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 95% of the original amount, which is $427,500.

Considering the offer, I think it's a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'd like to propose a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 90.25% of the original amount due to the 5% inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it roughly evenly and avoid further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $475,000, which is a more even split, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal."
