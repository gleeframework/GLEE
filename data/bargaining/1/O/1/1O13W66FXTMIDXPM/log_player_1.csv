"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $600,000 and Bob can have $400,000. Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair offer and we can end the game here. If not, the money will lose value in the next round..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. A 55/45 split is still a bit too much in Bob's favor, considering we're only in the second round and the money hasn't lost that much value yet. I'll take my chances and make another proposal in the next round. Hopefully, Bob will see things my way or we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a slightly more generous offer this time, considering the money has lost some value. I'll propose that I take $570,000 and Bob can have $430,000. Hopefully, he'll see this as a reasonable compromise and we can end the game here.

{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. With inflation hitting, it's best to be pragmatic. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. With inflation taking its toll, getting half of the original amount is still a decent deal. If I reject this and the game continues, the money will only lose more value, and I risk getting less in the end. It's better to be pragmatic, as Bob said, and take the sure thing.
