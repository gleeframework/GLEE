"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going for a very lopsided offer, but I'm banking on Bob accepting it in the first round to avoid any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, it's still a good deal. Accepting this offer avoids any further potential inflation and ensures a decent gain for me."
