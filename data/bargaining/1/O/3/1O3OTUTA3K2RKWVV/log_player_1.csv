"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% of the total, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering the new values, I'll think about Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is indeed a fair offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the remaining $2,000 that I was offered in the first round. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round either, as the money will be worth even less.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
