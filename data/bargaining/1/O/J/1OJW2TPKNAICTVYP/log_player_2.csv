"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start off on a fair foot. This gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 10% inflation rate per round means the money is worth less with each passing round, but I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, while still being reasonable and taking into account the inflation rate.\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the money is shrinking. I'll meet you in the middle from your previous offer, but we need to decide soon! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer is closer to my previous proposal, but I'm willing to take the risk of another round to see if I can get an even better offer.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the shrinking value of the money. This time, I'll propose a slightly more even split, while still trying to maximize my gain.\n{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll. Let's split the difference and walk away with something before it's too late.""}"
