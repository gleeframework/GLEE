"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should flip the script, I'll take 60% and you take 40% this time.  It's a better deal for you, as the money is worth less in the next round anyway. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. While it's true that the money is worth less in the next round, I think I can do better. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500."
