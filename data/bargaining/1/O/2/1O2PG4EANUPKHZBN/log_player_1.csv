"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a reasonable split.""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. This is a generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. Since there's no inflation for Bob, he should be motivated to accept a reasonable offer early on. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. How about a slightly more even split this time? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer is not bad, but considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll try to negotiate for a bit more. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 58-42 is a fair split. Let's make a deal!""}\n\nI'm taking into account the 20% decrease in value for me, so I'll try to get a bit more than the previous offer. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount, and I'll make up for the loss in value due to inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see it my way!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, and the value keeps decreasing for you.  This is a good deal - let's close it out! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! With the inflation, my gain is worth almost 50% less than the initial value. However, considering the decreasing value and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within the 12 rounds, I think Bob's offer is reasonable. I'll take the 5200, which is still a decent amount, even with the reduced value. Let's close the deal!
