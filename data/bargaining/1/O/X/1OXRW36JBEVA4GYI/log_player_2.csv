Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I can see that. My offer is still better for me 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one!  While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, here's why I need to accept:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of my potential gain is dropping dramatically each round (now at a 34.39% loss!). 
* **Alice's Stance:** She's been consistently aiming for a larger share and seems unlikely to budge.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from her, and the longer this goes on, the worse the deal gets for me.

It's painful, but taking the 43 now is better than risking a worse outcome later."
