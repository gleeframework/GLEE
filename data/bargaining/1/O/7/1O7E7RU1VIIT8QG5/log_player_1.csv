Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a significant share, but leaves Bob with a decent amount as well.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll aim to maximize my share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my target is to maximize my share. I'll propose a higher amount for myself this time.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the amount I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a relatively fair division. I'll consider this a reasonable compromise.
