"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take a small piece and we'll be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. I believe I can get a better deal than just 0.1% of the total amount.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, since we're in the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, right?\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to the next step!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money loses 10% of its value for me with each passing round, I'll try to be strategic with my offer.\n\n###\n\nHere's my proposal for round 2:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to her response!"
