Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a more balanced split that acknowledges the time value of money for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
