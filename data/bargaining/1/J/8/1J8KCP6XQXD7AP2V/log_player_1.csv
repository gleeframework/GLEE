"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 300k. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, inviting him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less, so I need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Since the original $1,000,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, I'll calculate the new values as follows:

Alice gain: 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444.44
Bob gain: 600,000 / 0.9 = 666,666.67

My decision is to reject this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, Alice. I think this is a fair compromise. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll!

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the new values as follows:

Original $1,000,000 is now worth 1 - 0.271 = 0.729 of its original value.

Alice gain: 500,000 / 0.729 = 686,818.85
Bob gain: 500,000 / 0.729 = 686,818.85

It looks like we're meeting in the middle, and the gains are almost equal! I'll accept this offer.
