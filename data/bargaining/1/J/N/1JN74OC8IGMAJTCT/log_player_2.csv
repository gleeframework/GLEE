"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer allows me to get a good share while ensuring you still receive a significant sum, Bob. Let's avoid the risks of inflation and settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, it's too early in the game to settle for such a large disparity. I'll try to get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This way we both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of losing money to inflation. It's a win-win situation for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the idea of a fair split, but the decreasing value makes it riskier for me as time goes on. This offer still gives you a substantial amount and allows me to secure a larger portion. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still skewed in her favor, even with the inflation factor. I'm willing to risk another round to try and secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a bigger portion than 400k to make it worthwhile for me considering the inflation.  This offer is fair to both of us, and we can avoid the risk of losing even more money.""
