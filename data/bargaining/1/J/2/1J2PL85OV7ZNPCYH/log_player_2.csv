"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide the funds equally considering the decreasing value over rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's proposal seems fair on the surface, it significantly favors her due to the different inflation rates.  By rejecting, Bob forces Alice to make a new proposal in the next round where his money will be worth 10% less, but hers will be worth 20% less. This creates a potential for a more favorable deal for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split is more equitable considering the inflation rates, as your money is losing value faster.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rates, I propose an equal division of the funds to ensure fairness in value received by both parties. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The inflation rates have drastically decreased the value of both of our potential gains.
* **Equal Split:** While Alice's offer is a 50/50 split, it's important to note that the actual value we receive is significantly less than the initial proposal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** By rejecting this offer, we risk further rounds of negotiation where the value continues to decrease.  There is no guarantee that a better deal will emerge.

Therefore, accepting the 50/50 split minimizes the risk of further losses due to inflation."
