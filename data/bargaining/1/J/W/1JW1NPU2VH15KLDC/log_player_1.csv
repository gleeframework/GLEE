Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is worth 0.95 * 60 = 57 dollars. Bob's gain of 60 is worth 60 dollars.
