"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give myself $600,000 and keep $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is 300,000 for me, that's equivalent to 300,000 / 0.9 = 333,333.33 in the first round. That's a good deal, so I'll accept his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
