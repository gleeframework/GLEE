Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time.  I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation we both have to deal with. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
