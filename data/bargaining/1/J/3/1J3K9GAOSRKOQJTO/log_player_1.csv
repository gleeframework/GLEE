Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $450,000.

I'm not sure I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split, considering the inflation effect. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.
