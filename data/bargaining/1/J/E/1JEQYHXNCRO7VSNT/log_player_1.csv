"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Let's try a 70-30 split in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new values, Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: $3,000 (20% less than $4,000)
* Bob gain: $6,700 (10% less than $7,500)

I'm not sure I like the new numbers. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give you the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping some leverage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to meet you halfway now. But I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the risk of you rejecting my offer again. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the new values, Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: $2,400 (48.8% less than $4,600)
* Bob gain: $4,560 (27.1% less than $6,300)

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 60-40 split, but it's getting closer to what I'd like. I'll think about it for a moment...
