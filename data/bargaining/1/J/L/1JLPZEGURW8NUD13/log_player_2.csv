"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. There are 12 rounds left, and the value of the money will decrease for Alice faster than it will for me.  I'll see if I can get a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more even split. This offer reflects the decreasing value of the money for both of us, so let's make it work.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. My last offer was already generous, this is the best you'll get. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still tempting, but I'm not convinced it's the best I can do.  The value of the money is dropping faster for her than for me, and we have several rounds left. I'm going to see if I can get a slightly better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both. This offer is a fair split, considering the inflation we're facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising here.  Let's be realistic - this deal gets worse for both of us the longer we wait. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offers are getting less appealing. While this is the best offer she has made so far, the value of the money is decreasing for me at a faster rate than for her. I'll see if I can get a better deal by pushing for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing value with each passing round.  It's time to stop this back-and-forth and agree on a fair split. This offer is a true 50/50, ensuring we both get the most out of the remaining value.  Let's end this now.""}
