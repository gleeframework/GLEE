# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair start, and we can both benefit from the inflation later on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is worth 95% of the initial amount, which is 47.5 dollars. Bob's gain of 50 dollars is worth 80% of the initial amount, which is 40 dollars.
