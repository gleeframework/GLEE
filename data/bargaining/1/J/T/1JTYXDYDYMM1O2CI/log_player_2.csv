"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent cut. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, waiting a few rounds will give Bob much more leverage due to the inflation for him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but the deal needs to be more balanced for us both. This offer reflects the time pressure we both face.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Bob needs to counter Alice's aggressive opening with a strong offer of his own. A 60/40 split in his favor is a good starting point. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By mentioning the ""time pressure,"" Bob subtly reminds Alice that the value of the money decreases for him with each passing round. This encourages her to take the offer seriously.
* **Future Negotiation:** While this is a strong offer for Bob, it leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects it.  He can afford to decrease his share slightly in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it closer to even. I'm willing to compromise, but we need to move faster to get something before the value drops too much. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice is moving towards a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor. Accepting now would mean Bob lost ground compared to his own Round 2 offer.
* **Inflation Advantage:** Time is on Bob's side. The longer Alice waits, the more appealing Bob's future offers will look due to the decreasing value of the money for him. 
* **Strategic Waiting:**  Bob can afford to wait another round or two. His offer in Round 4 or 5 can still be reasonable for Alice while securing a better outcome for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. This is a fair split considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Strong:** Bob shows willingness to negotiate by decreasing his demand from 6000 to 5500. However, it's still a better split for him than Alice's last offer.
* **Urgency:**  The message reinforces the time pressure.  Even though Bob benefits more from the delay, he frames it as a loss for both to make the offer seem more appealing.
* **""Fairness"":**  The word ""fair"" is strategically used. While the split favors Bob, he presents it as a balanced solution given the decreasing value of the money for him. This might make Alice more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time. Let's split it down the middle and avoid losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing significantly increases. The inflation is steadily working against Bob.
* **Acceptable Split:** While not ideal, a 50/50 split is much better than Bob's likely outcome if he continues to reject offers and the negotiations fail. It's unlikely Alice will offer a better deal at this stage.
* **Avoiding Disaster:**  Greed can lead to a worse outcome. Accepting a reasonable offer ensures that Bob gets something, rather than risking everything on a potentially unattainable better deal."
