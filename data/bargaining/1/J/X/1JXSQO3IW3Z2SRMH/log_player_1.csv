Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very unequal offer. I figure that since I get to propose first, I might as well try to grab the lion's share.  If Bob rejects this, he'll have to propose something that gives me at least a little more, or he risks getting nothing!  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 98 
# Bob gain: 2 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  Even though I'm getting a little less, it's still a significant gain, and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round.  Besides, Bob is being surprisingly generous!"
