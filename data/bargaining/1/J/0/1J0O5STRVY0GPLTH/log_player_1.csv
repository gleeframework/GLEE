"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, I'll give you a fair split. But I'll get a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a very good offer, considering that Bob is trying to get more than half of the money. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer doesn't seem to be moving in that direction. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about compromising. I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit frustrated with Bob's offers. I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm not budging, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him more than 50%. I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will come back with a more reasonable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50""}

I'm trying to be more conciliatory and propose a 50/50 split. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, and I hope Bob will finally accept it."
