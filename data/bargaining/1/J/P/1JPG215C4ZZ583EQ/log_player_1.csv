Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering a larger share than you did, and it's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
