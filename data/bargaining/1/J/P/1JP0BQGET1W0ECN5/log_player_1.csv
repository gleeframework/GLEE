"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good deal for me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll think carefully about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go any further!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, but I'm still willing to give Bob a good chunk of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not getting any younger, so don't expect me to go any further 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll think carefully about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The value of the money is decreasing so rapidly that I think it's better to take what I can get now rather than risking it going even lower."
