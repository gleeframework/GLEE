# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since Alice is more affected by the inflation, I'll try to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 60/40 split is still the fairest option considering the inflation. Let's reach a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Although the money is worth less for both of us, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal considering the larger impact of inflation on Alice's gain.
