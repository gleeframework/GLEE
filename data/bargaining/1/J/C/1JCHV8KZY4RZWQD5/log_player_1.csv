Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to get the game over quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most rational choice. Given the inflation, waiting for another round could potentially lead to a smaller gain for me.  50% is still a good outcome, and it ends the game quickly."
