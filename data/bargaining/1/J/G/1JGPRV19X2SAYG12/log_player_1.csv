I'm going to try and get the most money possible, but I'm also willing to compromise a little bit to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm taking a slightly bigger risk this time, but I'm still trying to maximize my gains while considering the inflation."
