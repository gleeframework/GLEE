  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 into two parts, with you receiving $2,500. I believe this is a fair split considering our potential loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the risk of inflation and gives us both a decent amount to start with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
