"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, but I'm offering a slightly larger share to start the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's go with 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think 55/45 is a more balanced split than my initial offer, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
