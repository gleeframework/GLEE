"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good offer, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not sure I want to give up 200,000, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round. Considering the inflation, my gain is already worth 10% less than the initial amount. I'll accept this offer.
