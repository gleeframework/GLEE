Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a more even split.  Let's be fair and avoid unnecessary rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob presents his offer as ""fair,"" it's only fair in a nominal sense. Due to the 10% inflation for Bob, his actual gain is worth less than what's presented. 

* **My perspective:**  $4500 remains the same value to me in the next round.
* **Bob's perspective:** $5500 is now worth only $4950 to him ($5500 - 10%).

By rejecting, I force Bob to deal with the increasing inflation on his end, putting me in a stronger position for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob! My offer is even better this round for me, and it's the last chance for you to get a reasonable deal before inflation eats further into your share.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. 

* **Inflation is my ally:**  Every round makes the nominal value less appealing for Bob.
* **I'm showing flexibility, but with a firm hand:**  I increased my share slightly, emphasizing that time is on my side.  
* **Creating urgency:** By highlighting that this is his ""last chance"" for a ""reasonable"" deal, I'm hoping to push Bob towards accepting a deal that's advantageous for me."
