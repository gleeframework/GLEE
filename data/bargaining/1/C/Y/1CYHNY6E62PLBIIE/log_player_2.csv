Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is running out.  It's worth risking another rejection to try and secure a better deal before inflation eats away too much of the potential winnings."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5300,
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Time is running out! This is my final offer. Let's end this before we both lose.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm applying a bit of pressure here. By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping Alice will recognize the risk of losing a decent amount of money if she continues to reject. It's still a slightly advantageous split for me, but it's within the realm of potentially being accepted given the time constraint."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not backing down. You should consider the cost of walking away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly playing hardball. While this offer isn't ideal, the relentless march of inflation means each subsequent round will offer significantly less value.  It's better to take a less favorable split now than risk ending up with nothing if Alice refuses to budge further."
