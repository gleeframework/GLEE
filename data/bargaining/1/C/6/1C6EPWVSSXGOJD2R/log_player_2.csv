Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though it's a bit better, time is ticking and the money is losing value quickly. I need to aim for a more favorable split in the next round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but we need to reach an agreement soon.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting even less as inflation eats away at the total and we run out of rounds.
