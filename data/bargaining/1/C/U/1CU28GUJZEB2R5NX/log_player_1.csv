"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, but I'm aiming for a good chunk of the money! I'll see if Bob is willing to take a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm getting a smaller share, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll see if I can negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept before the inflation kicks in again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting less than I originally hoped for,  Bob's offer is starting to look more appealing given the inflation. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
