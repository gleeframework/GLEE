"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the new offer from Bob, taking into account the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll calculate my gain as 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000.

The money Bob gains is worth 5% less, so I'll calculate his gain as 600,000 * 0.95 = 570,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain will be 10% less than my initial offer in round 1. So, I'll propose:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate my gain, I'll apply the 27.1% reduction to my initial offer in round 1:

$600,000 * 0.7279 (1 - 0.2721) = $437,740

Comparing this to Bob's offer, I see that he's offering me $440,000, which is slightly more than my calculated gain. However, I'll also consider the gain for Bob. His gain is worth 14.26% less than his initial offer in round 1:

$400,000 * 0.8557 (1 - 0.1443) = $342,280

Considering both gains, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer."
