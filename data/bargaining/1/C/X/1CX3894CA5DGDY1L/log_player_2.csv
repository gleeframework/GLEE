"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering I'm losing value each round 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!  It's worth seeing what Alice will offer in the next round, considering she loses value more quickly than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm also losing value each round, so let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation. It's a good compromise, and I'd rather secure a gain than risk getting nothing at all."
