"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm sending a friendly message to Bob suggesting we start with an equal division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share to account for potential future inflation 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll need to consider whether this offer is fair.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 60-40 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to 50-50, but still takes into account the inflation factor. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to an even split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor than the 50-50 split I initially suggested, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 37.5 
# Bob gain: 62.5 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I'll need to consider whether this offer is fair.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 62.5-37.5 split, especially considering the significant inflation factor affecting Bob's gain. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 62.5-37.5, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to 50-50, taking into account the increasing inflation factor. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 57.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to an even split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42.5-57.5 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor than the 45-55 split I previously suggested, but still leaves room for negotiation."
