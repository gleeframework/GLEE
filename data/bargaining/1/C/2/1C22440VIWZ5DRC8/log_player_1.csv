"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the first round!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to take a 40/60 split. However, I do think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than my initial proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you can do better than this!""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to squeeze in a bit more for myself while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think we can both do better.  Let's split it more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm getting more cautious with my decisions. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, but I'm willing to accept a slightly more even split.
