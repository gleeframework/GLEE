Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. How about a 55/45 split? It's still a slight advantage for you, but more equitable. Keep in mind, the value decreases with each round! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
