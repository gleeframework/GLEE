"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice.  I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Alice's gain: $5,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $4,000 (20% less than $5,000)

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in the offer, as it's not as favorable to me as I'd like. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This way, I'll still get a bit more, but it's a fair split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but I need a better share than 40%.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Alice's gain: $4,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $3,120 (48.8% less than $6,000)

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept the offer, as it's a better split than my previous offers and better than the initial 80-20 split."
