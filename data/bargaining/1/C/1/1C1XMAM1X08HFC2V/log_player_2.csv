"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round if you want. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, I'm going to reject.  I know the money will be worth less in the next round due to inflation, but I have a chance to get a better deal then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm offering a 550,000/450,000 split.  Inflation is a factor, but I believe this is a fair deal that reflects our ability to negotiate.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm looking for a slightly higher share. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject again. While inflation is a factor, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I believe Alice will be more willing to negotiate in the next round to avoid further delays."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""I'm offering a 400,000/600,000 split. We've both had a chance to negotiate, and I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not getting any younger, and I'm looking for a more substantial share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, this is my last chance to get anything.  Alice is clearly taking advantage of the situation, but accepting her offer is better than getting nothing at all."
