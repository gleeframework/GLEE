Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 550000/450000 split.  Inflation is a factor, but I believe this is a fair deal that reflects our ability to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation factor, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'll reject Bob's proposal and make a counteroffer.

```

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 400000/600000 split. We've both had a chance to negotiate, and I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more aggressive move now that he's had a chance to see my previous offers. However, I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me. Considering the inflation, I'd like to try to get a better share.
