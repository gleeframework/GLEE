I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. Since this is the first round, I want to secure a large portion of the money, knowing that the value will decrease for me in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $550,000 and keep $450,000 for myself.  This is a compromise, as I'm losing money each round due to inflation.  I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and end the game before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The value of the money has decreased significantly, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal if I reject this offer and continue to the next round."
