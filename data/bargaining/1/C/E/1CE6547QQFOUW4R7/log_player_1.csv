"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate. However, Bob's offer is still a significant reduction from the initial amount.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has taken a toll, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite out of the money! Considering the reduced value, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time. I'll consider accepting it to avoid further negotiations.
