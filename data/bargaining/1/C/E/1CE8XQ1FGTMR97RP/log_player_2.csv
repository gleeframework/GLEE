"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! 70/30 split, you get a good deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take my chances and try to get a better offer in the next round. The 20% inflation hit isn't too bad for the first round, so I'll risk it to see if I can get more than 30% of the money.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 42/58 is a fair split. Let's make a deal before the money loses more value!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your previous offer, but I need a bit more. This is my final offer, let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer in round 3. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is already worth 36% less than in the first round, and it will only get worse if we continue. While I was hoping for a better deal, I think it's wise to cut my losses and accept the 35% share before the value drops even further. Let's close the deal!"
