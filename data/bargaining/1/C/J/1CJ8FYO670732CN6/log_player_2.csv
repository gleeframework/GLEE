# Alice gain: 550000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both want to come out ahead. This back and forth isn't benefiting either of us with inflation eating away at our potential gains.  Let's be sensible and split this down the middle 50/50 before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
