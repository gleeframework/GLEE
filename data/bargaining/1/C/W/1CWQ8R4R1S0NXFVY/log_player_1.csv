"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. I think this is a fair split, and I'd like to end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $500,000 is actually worth 80% of $800,000, which is $640,000.

I think Bob's offer is a good one, and splitting it evenly is a fair way to go. I'll accept his offer.
