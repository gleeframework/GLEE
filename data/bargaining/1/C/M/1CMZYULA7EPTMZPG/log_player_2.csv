Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end. Let's be reasonable. I'm offering 60/40, which is a fair compromise given the inflation affecting you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Assistant: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll take the 4000, which is still a decent amount. Let's end the game here.\n\n###\n\n###\n\n(Note: The game is over. The final division is 4000 for Bob and 6000 for Alice.)\n\n###\n\n###\n\nThanks for playing the game with me! If you want to play again, feel free to start a new game."
