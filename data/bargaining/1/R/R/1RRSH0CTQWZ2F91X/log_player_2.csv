"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a good starting point.  Bob should reject the offer.  Even though the offer is presented as ""fair"", the inflation will significantly hurt Bob more than Alice in the coming rounds, and Bob has the potential to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  This is a fair deal given the inflation and will help us both maximize our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was tempting, but I need a bit more to agree. This is still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer. Even though the inflation is hurting him significantly, he still has leverage in this situation. Alice has already rejected his even split, showing she is willing to risk more rounds. Bob should continue to try and push for a more even split in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's make a deal. I'm willing to compromise, but this is the best offer I can make given the inflation affecting us both. It's a good outcome for us both, and will avoid more rounds of negotiation.""}
