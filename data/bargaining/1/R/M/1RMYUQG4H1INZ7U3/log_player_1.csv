"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 400k. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount is $1,000,000. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. How about we split it 7 to 3? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob thinks he can do better.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""7 to 3 is a bit too skewed in your favor, Bob. I'll stick to my guns and reject this offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, as I think it's not fair considering the initial amount. Now it's my turn to make a new proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise at 54-46. It's still a fair split, and I think we can wrap this up here.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding firm on the 54-46 split. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
