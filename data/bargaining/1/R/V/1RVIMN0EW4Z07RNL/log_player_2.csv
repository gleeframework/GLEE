"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a great start to a game! I'm eager to see how this plays out.  

**Reasoning:**

* **It's Round 1:** There's a lot of time left, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. 
* **Inflation:**  While the offer is decent, the inflation rate will make my share worth less in later rounds. I want to see if I can get more now.
* **Negotiation:** By rejecting, I force Alice to make a new offer in the next round, and I get to be the one proposing after that. This puts me in a more advantageous position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's aim for a more even split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The inflation rate is starting to bite, and I've lost a significant portion of my potential gains.  
* **Fairness:** While Alice's offer still favors her, it's getting closer to a more even split, and it's likely the best I can get at this point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to reject offers could lead to a situation where both of us get nothing. Accepting now secures a decent sum.

I'm willing to compromise to avoid losing everything to inflation."
