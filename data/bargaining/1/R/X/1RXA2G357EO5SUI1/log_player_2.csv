"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's speed things up. This offer is much better for both of us considering the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer acknowledges the inflation we're both facing while still being a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer, it's the best you'll get considering the rapid inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement. I'm dropping my ask significantly, taking into account the time pressure.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe for Bob. Accepting Alice's offer of $40 is the best choice, as rejecting it will likely lead to an even worse outcome in the next round. 

Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  Bob is losing almost 60% of the value of the money with each round that passes. Waiting will significantly hurt his potential gain.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice knows Bob is under pressure, and her offer, while still favoring her, has become more reasonable. She's unlikely to offer a better deal in a future round.

While $40 is less than Bob's previous offers, it's crucial to remember the context of the game. Taking the guaranteed, albeit smaller, amount now is preferable to risking getting even less later.
