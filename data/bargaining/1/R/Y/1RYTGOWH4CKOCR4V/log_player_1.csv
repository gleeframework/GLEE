"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about the offer.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal. My current offer was 60-40, and Bob's offer is 50-50, which is a significant concession in my favor. I'm hoping to get an even better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly better deal than the 50-50 split that Bob offered in the previous round.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more for myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get closer to my target 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to be careful about the value of my offer. Since Bob is still offering a 50-50 split, I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and try to push for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 19.51% less than in the first round now. I'll have to be careful with my offer.

I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive stance, aiming for a better deal than the 50-50 split that Bob has been offering.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more for myself. This is my final offer.""
