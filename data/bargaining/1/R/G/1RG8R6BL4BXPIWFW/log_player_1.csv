"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. My message is a friendly suggestion to split the money 7:3, which is a relatively fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you'll take it 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $60 is now worth 90% of the original $70, which is $63. And Bob's gain of $40 is worth 95% of the original $30, which is $38.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm still getting a smaller share than I initially proposed, but it's a bit better than the initial offer. Let's see...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of the original amount (90% of 90% = 81%). I'll make a new offer, trying to account for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 54,
  ""bob_gain"": 46,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm being generous""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's try to reach a deal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 73.9% of the original $70, which is approximately $51.93. And Bob's gain of $50 is worth 83.33% of the original $30, which is approximately $25.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It's a 50:50 split, which is a fair deal, but I'm still getting a slightly lower value than I initially proposed. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.
