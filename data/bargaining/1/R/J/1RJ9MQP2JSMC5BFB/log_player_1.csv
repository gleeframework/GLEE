"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a chance to counter""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original 100$ ($20), and I'll take 80% ($80). I'm framing it as a 4:1 split, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll give you a chance to accept my offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so the effective value of my gain is 80% of the original 80% I offered in the first round, which is 64.

Bob's offer is for me to get 40, which is 50% of the original 100. However, since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, the effective value of his gain is 80% of 60, which is 48.

Considering the inflation effect, I think Bob's offer is actually a good deal for me, as I'm getting a higher effective value (64) compared to the effective value of his gain (48).

I'll accept the offer.
