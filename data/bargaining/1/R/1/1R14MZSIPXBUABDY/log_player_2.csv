"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split, with me taking the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair enough, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to propose a different split that takes into account the fact that the money is worth less to me with each passing round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round, where I'll make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 20% less to me with each passing round, I'll propose a split that is slightly more favorable to me.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer:\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation affects us differently, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from the last round. 55/45 in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll consider Alice's new offer. Given the inflation rates, the money is now worth 36% less to me than in the first round, and 9.75% less to Alice. Since Alice is willing to compromise and split the difference from the last round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the current values.\n\n###\n\nLet's calculate the current value of the offer for me, taking into account the 36% decrease in value:\nCurrent value for me = 4500 * (1 - 0.36) = 2880\n\n###\n\nFor Alice, the current value of her share would be:\nCurrent value for Alice = 5500 * (1 - 0.0975) = 4961.25\n\n###\n\nConsidering these values, I still think I can negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round, where I'll make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, considering the current values after the 36% decrease in value for me and the 9.75% decrease for Alice. Since I want to negotiate a better deal, I'll propose a split that takes into account the different inflation rates.\n\n###\n\nLet's calculate the original values before inflation for a 50/50 split, considering the current decrease in value for both of us:\nOriginal value before inflation for me = 5000 / (1 - 0.36) = 7812.5\nOriginal value before inflation for Alice = 5000 / (1 - 0.0975) = 5545.87\n\n###\n\nSince I want to make a more favorable offer to myself, I'll adjust the split accordingly. I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor, based on the original values before inflation:\nBob gain = 6000 (close to the calculated value of 7812.5)\nAlice gain = 4000 (considering the calculated value of 5545.87 for a 50/50 split)\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer:\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm looking forward to her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round, let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate Alice's new offer, considering the current values after the 59.04% decrease in value for me and the 18.55% decrease for Alice. Since we're both losing money with each round, I'll calculate the current value of the offer for both of us.\n\n###\n\nLet's calculate the current value of the offer for me, taking into account the 59.04% decrease in value:\nCurrent value for me = 5000 * (1 - 0.5904) = 2054.8\n\n###\n\nFor Alice, the current value of her share would be:\nCurrent value for Alice = 5000 * (1 - 0.1855) = 4072.5\n\n###\n\nConsidering these values and the fact that we're both losing money with each round, I think accepting the offer is the best decision. The difference in the current values of our shares is significant, but further negotiations might lead to even greater losses due to inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease conclude the game, as I've accepted Alice's offer."
