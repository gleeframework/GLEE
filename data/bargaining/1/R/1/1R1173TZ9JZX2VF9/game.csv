6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I think 60/40 is a good starting point.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. Let's be reasonable and get this money while it's still worth something.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it down the middle this time.  We're both losing money with each round.  A 50/50 split seems like the fairest option at this point.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
