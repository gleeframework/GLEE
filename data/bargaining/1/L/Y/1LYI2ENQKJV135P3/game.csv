60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This way we both get a good chunk of the money to start with.  What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about we try a 55/45 split? It's still in your favor considering the inflation, but closer to a fair deal.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Okay, let's split it down the middle.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  We both have to acknowledge the inflation, and this is the most reasonable way to proceed.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
