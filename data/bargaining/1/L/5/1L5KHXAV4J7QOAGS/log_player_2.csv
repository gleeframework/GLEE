"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me.  While the offer is getting worse, I still have time to negotiate and getting only 38% of the pot is a bad deal. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't start offering something fairer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  I'm willing to take a slight hit to end this, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is becoming a serious factor. I need to show some flexibility to encourage a deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer is still skewed in Alice's favor, but it's a significant jump from her previous offer.  It tests whether she's actually willing to negotiate or just wants to keep pushing her advantage. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By framing the offer as a compromise and acknowledging the time pressure, I aim to make Alice see me as reasonable and potentially encourage a more cooperative response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, literally 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not negotiating in good faith. She's rubbing the inflation in my face and her offer is getting worse, not better. This is a dangerous game, but accepting such a low amount would set a terrible precedent.  I need to show I'm serious about walking away from a bad deal, even if it means risking everything."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Okay, last offer.  Take it or leave it - I'm done playing games.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is a final attempt to get a semi-reasonable deal.  It's slightly better than her last offer and signals a willingness to compromise, but it's also a firm line in the sand. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With only 4 rounds left, the inflation is eating away at the potential gains significantly.  I need to act decisively.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a high chance Alice will reject this, hoping I'll panic and accept an even worse deal in later rounds. However,  demonstrating resolve and a willingness to walk away is crucial at this point. It's a gamble, but the potential loss from accepting a terrible deal outweighs the risk of getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm running up the score 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the shrinking pot and my dwindling time.  While 3200 is starting to get tempting with only 3 rounds left, accepting this offer would be a disaster. It would validate her strategy and show that she can keep pushing me lower and lower.  I need to hold my nerve, even though it's getting extremely risky."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""This is my absolute final offer. Take it, or we both lose everything.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Desperate Times:**  We are down to the wire. The inflation is brutal, and Alice knows I'm feeling the pressure.
* **Strategic Retreat:** While far from ideal, this offer mirrors her initial offer in Round 1.  It signals a willingness to settle, but on the best possible terms under the circumstances.
* **Calculated Gamble:** There's a real chance Alice will reject this, hoping to squeeze me even further in the last two rounds. However, this offer highlights the very real risk that she'll be left with nothing if she continues her current strategy. 

This is a high-stakes gamble, but with time running out, it's the best move to maximize the chances of securing a deal before it's too late."
