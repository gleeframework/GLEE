"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you accept this one! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but don't expect me to give away too much""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000, which is $7,000, and Bob gets the remaining $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's try to find a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation and the previous offers. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable solution, and I'm willing to accept $5,000 and Bob can take the remaining $5,000."
