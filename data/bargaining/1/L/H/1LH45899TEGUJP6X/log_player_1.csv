Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I understand you want a larger share, but that offer is too low for me.  I propose a 65/35 split. Consider that the value decreases for both of us each round, especially you. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
