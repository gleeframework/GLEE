"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation works in my favor in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems tempting at first glance, it's important to think strategically. 

* **Inflation:**  Even though the money is devaluing for both of us, it's devaluing faster for me. Accepting a worse deal now just because it might get even worse later isn't the best strategy.
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject this offer, I get to propose in the next round. While the money will be worth less, I'll have a stronger position to negotiate a more favorable split.

It's a gamble, but I believe I can secure a better outcome by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm taking a risk by accepting a smaller share than you, even with the inflation working against me. This offer is fair and lets us both benefit.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Retreat:** I've stepped back slightly from my initial 60/40 demand, acknowledging the changing value of the money. 
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that I'm making a concession and taking on more risk with this offer, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Time Pressure:**  Every round that passes diminishes the value of the money, especially for me. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon."
