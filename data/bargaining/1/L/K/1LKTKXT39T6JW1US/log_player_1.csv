"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less now, I'm not as keen on giving away as much as I was initially. However, Bob's offer is a compromise, and meeting in the middle might be a good idea.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
