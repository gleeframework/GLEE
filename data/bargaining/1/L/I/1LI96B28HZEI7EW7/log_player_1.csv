I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer in my favor. Since we have 12 rounds, I want to make sure I secure the majority of the money early on.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is even more lopsided than mine was, and we're only in the second round! I'm not going to let him get away with that.  I'll try a more balanced offer next round, even though the money is worth less.  It's still better than getting nothing!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate. A 50/50 split seems fair given the circumstances.  We've both rejected lopsided offers, and it's getting risky with inflation."
