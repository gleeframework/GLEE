Alice's offer:

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be practical - I'll take a slight edge considering I'm making the offer, but this is as close to 50/50 as it's going to get. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100
