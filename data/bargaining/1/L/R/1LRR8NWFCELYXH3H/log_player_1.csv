"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about the 50% difference in the proposed split. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was a bit lopsided, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still keeps the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive!

While I'm not thrilled about the drastic difference in the proposed split, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the clock ticking. I'll think carefully about this offer.

Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm willing to take a chance on this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing.
