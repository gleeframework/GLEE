"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 999,000 to 1,000 split. This is a generous offer for Bob in the first round, giving me a strong starting position while leaving room for potential negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial gain for me. Accepting this offer guarantees a large sum, and the potential for negotiation is significantly reduced with each round."
