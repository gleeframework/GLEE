Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split.  Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is now worth 20% less, Bob's offer of $40 for me is actually equivalent to $32 in the first round. Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

I'll offer Bob $45 and take $55 for myself, hoping that he'll see this as a reasonable compromise. Let's see how he responds!"
