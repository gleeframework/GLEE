"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm willing to give you a significant portion, but a 60/40 split seems fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
