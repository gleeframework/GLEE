**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, hoping I'll cave due to the pressure of inflation. However, even with the decreasing value, accepting a deal significantly worse than a 50/50 split in later rounds is a bad strategy. I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair share."
