"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small amount, but it allows me to get a large share of the money. As the first offer, I want to be as greedy as possible, but still make it slightly appealing for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, it's unlikely Bob will offer more in the following rounds.  This is a fair offer, and given that he will be getting 10% less with every round, accepting now ensures that I get half the money."
