I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent share while still allowing me to maximize my potential earnings. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more, my gains are significantly reduced by inflation and it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
