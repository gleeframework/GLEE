"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives me a slight advantage since I'm the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous, but you can do better 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is 70/30, I'm not thrilled about giving him a larger share. However, I do appreciate his ""generosity"". Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll make a strategic decision.

I'll accept this offer for now, hoping to do better in future rounds.
