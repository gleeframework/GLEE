"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to be generous and give you a decent share. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% reduction in value due to inflation, I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best option.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""You can't get a better deal than this, Bob!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 70, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the 48.8% reduction, $55 is worth a lot less than it used to be.

I'll think carefully about this offer... but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is getting even scarcer. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm not budging!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 80, and I'm not leaving room for compromise. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice! Let's try to find a better compromise! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money now. With the 67.23% reduction, $65 is almost nothing.

I'll think carefully about this offer... and I'll accept it. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than walking away with nothing.
