"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's split the money quickly and avoid any further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share now and avoid a worse deal later! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 1% share of the original amount. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal if you wait!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but I'm keeping a larger share for myself. Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'm getting smart! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I need to be more realistic about what I can get. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $300,000 is a decent share, and I don't want to risk waiting for a worse deal in future rounds. Let's split the money and avoid further negotiations!"
