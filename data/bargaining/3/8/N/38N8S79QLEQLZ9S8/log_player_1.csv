I'm going to try to get as much as I can in the first round, knowing the money will be worth less each round.  This is a very risky move as Bob may reject it and I could end up with nothing.  But, if he accepts, I win!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would love to get more, I have no idea what Bob's inflation rate is. It's possible he's getting hit harder than me, which would mean he's more likely to make an even worse offer next round. It's best to take the 500,000 now while I know what I'm getting."
