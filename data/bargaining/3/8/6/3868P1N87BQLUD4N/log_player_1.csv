"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since I don't know how much the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value of money. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment from my side, still a fair offer, but with a slightly larger share for me""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 42/58 split, trying to find a sweet spot where I can get a slightly larger share without Bob rejecting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up! With the 14.26% decrease, my gain is worth significantly less than before.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially considering the significant erosion of my potential gain due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 36/64 split, trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and avoiding further erosion of my gain due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a stronger stance, but still open to negotiation 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20/80 split, especially considering the significant erosion of my gain due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal, but I'm getting close to my limit."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a last-ditch effort to get a fair share, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 25/75 split, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable share, but I still hope Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, this is my final offer 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a huge toll on my potential gain!

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 10/90 split, especially considering the significant erosion of my gain due to inflation. I've tried to be reasonable and compromise, but it seems Bob is not willing to meet me in the middle. I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a bold move to try to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 120000,
  ""bob_gain"": 880000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, but I'm still willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 12/88 split, trying to take advantage of Bob's previous concessions and get a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to budge further, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really crippling my potential gain now!

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 5/95 split, especially considering the massive erosion of my gain due to inflation. I've tried to be reasonable and compromise, but it seems Bob is not willing to meet me anywhere near the middle. I'll have to think carefully about my next move, as I'm running out of options."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a last-ditch effort to get a decent deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I'll take the minimum to avoid a total loss""
}
```

I'm offering Bob the entire $1,000,000, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game. I'm essentially giving up on any potential gain, but I'm trying to salvage what's left of my original $500,000 share."
