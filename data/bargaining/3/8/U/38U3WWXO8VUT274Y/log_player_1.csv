"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, I think I'll stick with my original offer. I'd rather not give Bob a bigger share, so I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the fact that Bob is now expecting a bigger share. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still keeping the majority for myself."
