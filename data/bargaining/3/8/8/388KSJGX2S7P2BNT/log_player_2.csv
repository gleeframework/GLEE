"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, let's start with a fair deal. Take this, and we'll be done with this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is tempting, it's too early to accept. We have 12 rounds, and with each round, the value of the money decreases. It's worth seeing if Alice will offer more in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
