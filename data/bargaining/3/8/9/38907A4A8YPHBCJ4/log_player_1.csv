"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's be fair"".\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. If he rejects, I'll wait for his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the value of money will decrease in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but will be worth 10% less for Bob in the next round, I have some leverage. However, Bob's offer gives him more than half, which might be his way of compensating for the future loss in value. Considering the message and the split, I think I can get a better deal, especially since the value for me doesn't decrease.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer and will make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Given that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob each round, but remains the same for me, I'll try to push a bit harder for a better deal. However, I also want to be cautious not to push Bob into rejecting and then having to accept a worse deal in the next round due to his decreasing valuation of the money.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering the future value, this seems fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $3,500 and keep $6,500 for myself, with the message ""Considering the future value, this seems fair"". This way, I acknowledge the impact of inflation on Bob's valuation but also assert my advantage in the negotiation.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a smaller share now to avoid further losses from inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems we've come full circle. Bob is now offering me the same deal I initially proposed to him in Round 1. Given that the value of the money has not changed for me but has significantly decreased for Bob, this deal is more advantageous to me now than it would have been if Bob had accepted it in the first round. Furthermore, Bob's message indicates a willingness to settle, suggesting he might not be willing to go much lower.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI accept Bob's offer of $6,000 for me and $4,000 for him. It's a good deal considering the circumstances, and it's time to end the game."
