"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I think a 65/35 split is fairer, considering the value of the money will decrease in the next round.  Let's be reasonable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my initial offer was more than fair.  This is my final offer before I expect an even larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I still think I could get a better deal, I'm not sure how much longer Alice will be willing to negotiate.  This is a significant drop from my initial goal, but better than getting nothing in the next round."
