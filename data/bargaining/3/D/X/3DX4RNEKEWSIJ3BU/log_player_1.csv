"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
