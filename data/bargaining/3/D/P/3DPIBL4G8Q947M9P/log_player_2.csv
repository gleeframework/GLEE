Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While it's getting worse for me each round, accepting a 40/60 split sets a bad precedent. There's a chance she might offer slightly better next round, or at least I can try to re-emphasize a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Okay, let's meet in the middle. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to try and salvage something from this negotiation.  Alice is clearly playing hardball, and the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me due to the inflation. Offering her a slight advantage but better than her previous offer might be the best I can do at this point. Making it clear this is my final offer adds some pressure."
