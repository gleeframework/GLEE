Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This ensures we both benefit from an early agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer is a good compromise to settle before inflation eats away more of our potential gains. Let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking close to a 55/45 split in his favor. While the decreasing value due to inflation adds pressure, accepting this offer still gives Bob a significant advantage. It's worth holding out for a better deal a little longer, especially since we started with a reasonable offer from Alice's side."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is eating our money! I'm making a final offer close to my original split. Let's be sensible and end this.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth is pointless. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both don't leave empty-handed. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob has finally moved to a 50/50 split. With the increasing impact of inflation, holding out for a better deal is becoming increasingly risky. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share, whereas continuing to reject could lead to getting nothing at all as the deadline approaches."
