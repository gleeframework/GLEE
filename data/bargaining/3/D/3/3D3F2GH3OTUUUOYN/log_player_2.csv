"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation penalty isn't too bad yet, so I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. This offer is better for you than waiting.""}
``` 

This offer is a bit more aggressive to account for the time pressure and the fact that Alice loses money at a faster rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer, but her offer is still not good enough.  While the inflation is starting to hurt, it hurts Alice more than me. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I hold out a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Time is money Alice!  Let's split the difference from my last offer and end this.""}
```

I'm nudging my offer closer to the middle ground while reminding Alice that time is running out and every round costs us both money. Let's see if she bites this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference? You're getting closer, but not quite there 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous. While Alice is coming down, she's taking advantage of the fact that inflation is hurting me.  She's clearly willing to play chicken with the deadline. I need to stand firm, but I'm getting worried."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be real.  This is it - take it or leave it.  Another round and we both lose out.""}
```

This is my final offer. I'm giving Alice a slight edge to end the game before inflation eats up too much of the potential gains.  It's a gamble, but I think it's the best chance I have at this point."
