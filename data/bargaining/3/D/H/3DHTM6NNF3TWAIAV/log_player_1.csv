"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is a fairer reflection of my negotiating skills.  Let's get this game started! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a 60-40 split in his favor!

I'm not interested in giving him a 60% share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, and hope to negotiate a better deal for myself!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, my offer will be adjusted accordingly. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly smaller share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical - we're both losing money with each round. This is my final offer, and I think it's fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a final offer, and it's a tough one!

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and the fact that we're both losing money with each round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not willing to accept a 65-35 split, as it's still not favorable to me.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next (and likely final) offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and we're in the fifth round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up yet. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
