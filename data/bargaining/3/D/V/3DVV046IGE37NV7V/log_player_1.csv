"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going for a pretty generous offer in the first round. I'm hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid inflation eating away at my share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, I'm still fairly confident that I can get a better deal in the next round.  Even with inflation, a 200,000 split is not a good deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 700,000 for myself, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before inflation eats away at my share even further.  I think this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting a little dicey. With the inflation, my share is shrinking rapidly.  While I'd prefer more, I'm going to accept this offer. At this point, it's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all."
