Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a bigger share this time.  Inflation is going to hurt Alice more than me, so I'm taking advantage of that. Let's see if you'll agree to this, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
