Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's as low as I'm willing to go. Inflation is hurting me more than you! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob, and she's conceding ground. However, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. By rejecting her offer and making a counter-proposal, Bob can likely secure a more advantageous deal in the next round as the value of the money continues to decrease, particularly for Alice."
