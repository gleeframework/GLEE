"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a fair starting point, I think I can get a better deal. Let's see if I can negotiate a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I believe this is a more balanced split considering our respective inflation rates. Let's make a deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time, as the inflation is impacting us both.  I think this is the most fair way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still think I could get a better deal, the inflation is starting to bite, and a 50/50 split is fair given the circumstances."
