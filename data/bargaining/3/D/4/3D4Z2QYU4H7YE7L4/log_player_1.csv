"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 80-20, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll be gaining 40 * 0.8 = 32 dollars, and Bob will be gaining 60 * 0.8 = 48 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
