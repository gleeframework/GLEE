**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly clinging to a larger share, but the decreasing value of the money is working against her more than me.  I need to signal I'm willing to play this out and that her offers are getting too greedy to be acceptable as time passes."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer before inflation makes it completely pointless for both of us.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm edging closer to an even split to signal I'm willing to compromise, but the tone is urgent.  Alice needs to understand that her stubbornness will cost her if she keeps rejecting offers in this range."
