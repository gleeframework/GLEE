"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering future value 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems fair on the surface, Alice is using the threat of inflation against me.  She gets a much better deal in this round because she's discounting the future less than I am.  I need to push for a more equitable split in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This offer accounts for the decreasing value of the money over time.  It ensures we both benefit fairly from an early agreement.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a stronger starting position to offset the inflation disadvantage. This offer still gives Alice a decent share, encouraging her to settle quickly. My message emphasizes fairness and the time pressure to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to make it seem like she's compromising, but this offer is barely better than her first one. The inflation is working in my favor now, and she's feeling the pressure. I need to hold firm and aim for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's close the deal and avoid losing more."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm holding firm on a 60/40 split, but shifting the offer slightly in Alice's favor. This shows some flexibility but still prioritizes my position. The message emphasizes the urgency and encourages Alice to accept before the deal gets even worse for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a fair share 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the heat!  While she claims to be compromising, her offer is only slightly better than before.  It seems like she's willing to go below a 60/40 split in her favor.  I'll hold out for a bit longer and see if she gets desperate enough to offer me a truly good deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 570000,
""alice_gain"": 430000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a generous offer considering the time remaining and the impact of inflation. Let's be sensible and secure a good deal for both of us."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small concession here to entice Alice, but it's still heavily in my favor. It's crucial to present this as a generous gesture on my part while highlighting the increasing pressure from inflation. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince her to accept and avoid further losses."
