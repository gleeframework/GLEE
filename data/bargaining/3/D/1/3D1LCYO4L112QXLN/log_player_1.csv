Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be fair and split it evenly before inflation eats any more of our potential gains.

# Bob gain: 500000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob's perception of the money's value is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer means he'll be even less likely to accept a deal where he gets less than half.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in future rounds. He might become more stubborn and offer even less favorable splits. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and it avoids the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
