"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be reasonable. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Considering Inflation:** While Alice's initial offer seems tempting, the value of the money decreases significantly with each round.  It's crucial to secure a deal quickly.
* **Fairness and Urgency:** Offering Alice slightly more than half (52%) acknowledges her desire for a larger share while still securing a reasonable amount for myself.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes fairness and the need for a swift agreement to avoid losses from inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money has decreased significantly. Accepting $4,200 now is better than risking a worse offer in the next round, where it will be worth even less.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems to be sticking to a larger share. Waiting might not result in a drastically better offer from her. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a decent share, even if it's slightly less than initially hoped for. It's better to secure something than risk getting a much smaller amount later."
