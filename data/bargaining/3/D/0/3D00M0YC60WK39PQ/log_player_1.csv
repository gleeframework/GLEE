"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, but I'm willing to be generous""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm framing it as a generous offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money, the offer from Bob is now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, I'd like to try to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and choosing to proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split in my favor, but I'm expressing some reservations about the deal. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also keeping the door open for further negotiation."
