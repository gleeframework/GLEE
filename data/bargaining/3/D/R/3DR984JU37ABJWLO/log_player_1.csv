"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $450,000.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Meeting in the middle is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $405,000 (since it's 10% less than $450,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still hoping for a better split! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $700,000 is now worth $511,700 (since it's 27.1% less than $700,000).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It's a bit better than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll take this offer.
