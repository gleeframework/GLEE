"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to 7:3, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's revised offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think about the relative values. In this round, I'd be getting 30, which is 30% of the current value of the money (since 30 is 30% of 100, and the value has decreased due to inflation). Bob would be getting 70, which is 70% of the current value.

Considering this, I think the 7:3 ratio is a bit skewed towards Bob's favor, but it's still a reasonable offer. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 45/55, a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, 50/50, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to end the negotiations with a 50/50 split. Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, I think this offer is actually quite reasonable.

In this round, the money is worth significantly less, but a 50/50 split would mean I get 50% of the current value of the money, which is still a decent amount. I'll decide to...

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
