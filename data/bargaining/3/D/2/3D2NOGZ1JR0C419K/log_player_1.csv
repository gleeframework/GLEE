"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. I keep 75$, and you get 25$. Considering the decreasing value of money, this might be a good deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable split.  Let's each take a little less than half.  Remember, the money will be worth less in the next round, so this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
