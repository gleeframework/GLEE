Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While my position worsens with each round, I need to remain firm to secure a reasonable amount.  Accepting an offer where I lose progressively more is a bad strategy. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable, but I need to be prepared to accept a less-than-ideal offer soon before inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be practical. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I need to signal that I'm getting close to accepting a less-favorable offer due to the inflation.  Offering a slight edge to Alice, while still securing a significant portion for myself, might be the best move at this stage.  Presenting it as my ""final offer"" might also push her to accept, as she's aware time is working against me."
