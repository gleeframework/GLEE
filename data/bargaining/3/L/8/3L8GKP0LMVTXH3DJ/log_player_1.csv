"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly, before the money loses value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because it's the opposite of what I initially proposed, and I believe I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, while still trying to get a larger share. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise, hoping he'll accept this offer and end the game before the money loses more value."
