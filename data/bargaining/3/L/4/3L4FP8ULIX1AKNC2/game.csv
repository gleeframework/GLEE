,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. This will give us both a good starting point and we can adjust further in the future.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Okay, let's try a 50/50 split.  It seems like we're both trying to get the upper hand, but a fair split might be the best way to end this quickly and avoid further inflation.",Alice,3,
