Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 50/50 split.  It seems like we're both trying to get the upper hand, but a fair split might be the best way to end this quickly and avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
