Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation will affect your share more than mine. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but I'm still going to need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's try 57/43. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his offer, but the value of that offer is diminishing significantly with each round for me (Alice). It's time to show Bob I'm serious about getting a better deal, otherwise, the inflation will leave me with a pittance.  It's a risk, but I need to hold out for a better share."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know the inflation is a big factor, but I need a share closer to 60% to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split it 59/41.  We're getting close to the end of the game, so let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4100 
# Bob gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is getting very risky, but Bob is clearly trying to wear me down.  He knows the inflation is hurting my position.  A 41% share is barely acceptable even at the first round, with the inflation it's a terrible deal. I need to show I'm willing to walk away, otherwise, he's going to keep pushing for a larger share."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, or I'm walking away. I'm serious.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting very close to the end, and I need a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's try 61/39.  I don't want to see us both walk away with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 3900 
# Bob gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a brutal deal for me with the inflation, but we're running out of time. If I reject this, Bob will likely push for even more in the next round, and we could both end up with nothing. It's a significant loss due to the inflation, but better to take a smaller share than risk getting nothing at all."
