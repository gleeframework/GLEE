"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the majority, you get a small slice to start.  Accept this and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though it's a small amount, I'll reject and see if I can get a better offer. I'll be the one making the proposal next round, and I can leverage the fact that Alice's money is losing value more quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
