This offer gives me a large share, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept it. If he doesn't, I'll adjust my offer in the next round to be more favorable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very generous, and I'd be happy to take it if we were in the first round. However, with the 5% inflation, my gain is only worth $95,000. This is not a good deal for me, so I will reject and try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm taking a bigger risk by proposing this, but with inflation, I need to secure a larger share. This offers a more even split than the previous round and I'm hoping Bob sees the benefit of ending the game here."
