"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but let's be realistic. I propose a more balanced split that ensures a good outcome for both of us. This money will be worth a lot less if we keep playing this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
