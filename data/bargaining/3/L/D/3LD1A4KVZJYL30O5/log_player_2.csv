"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the lion's share, but you get something too.  Let's see what you think!

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but let's be realistic. I propose a more balanced split that ensures a good outcome for both of us. This money will be worth a lot less if we keep playing this game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're wasting time here. Let's be reasonable and split this evenly.  The value of the money is decreasing with each round.  I think a 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to proceed. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
