"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amount I would gain is 60% of the current value, which is 60% of 80% of the initial $100 (since 20% was lost due to inflation in the first round, and another 20% is lost in this round). 

So, I would gain 0.6 * 0.8 * 100 = 48 dollars.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, let's split it 50/50!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept it."
