"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both be happy with this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
