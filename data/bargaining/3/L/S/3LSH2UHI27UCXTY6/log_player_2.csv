"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slight bias towards my gain. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Alice's offer is more favorable to her now. I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Alice rejected my previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 30/70, I'll try to counter with a more extreme ratio, favoring my gain. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}"
