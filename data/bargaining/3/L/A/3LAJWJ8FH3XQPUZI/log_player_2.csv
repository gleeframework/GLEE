Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly lower amount, hoping she'll accept and we can end the game. I'm not sure how inflation affects her, but I'm willing to risk it for a bigger cut!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Even though the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept.  The inflation is hitting me hard, but I still think I can get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is really hurting me at this point, and I don't think I can get a better deal.  A 50/50 split is better than nothing!"
