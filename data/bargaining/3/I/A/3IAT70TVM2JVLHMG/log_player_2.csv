Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but so do I.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's do $55 for me and $45 for you.  It's important we reach an agreement soon before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although it's not the 55/45 split I asked for, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most strategically sound decision at this point:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing for Alice faster than it is for me. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, whereas holding out might result in accepting a worse offer later due to her increasing need to settle. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're already in Round 3 with only 12 rounds total. The longer the negotiations drag on, the less appealing any offer becomes, especially for Alice. 

While I could gamble that Alice will become more desperate and offer a better deal later, the risk of losing everything increases with each passing round."
