Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's try a 70/30 split.  This still gives you a significant share, and it's a fairer distribution than the previous round's offer.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000
