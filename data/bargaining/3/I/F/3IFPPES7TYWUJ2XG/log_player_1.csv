"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 80, you take 20. Accept?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again! I'll take 40, you take 60. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

For me, 60 is equivalent to 66.67 in the first round (100 / 0.9), so I'll consider it as 66.67 in the current round.

For Bob, 40 is equivalent to 50 in the first round (100 / 0.8), so I'll consider it as 50 in the current round.

Considering the adjusted values, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70, you take 30. It's a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous this time, but still aiming to get a decent share of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'll still give you a good chunk. 35 for me, 65 for you. It's a decent split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me recalculate the adjusted values considering the inflation.

For me, 65 is equivalent to 87.5 in the first round (100 / 0.7714), so I'll consider it as 87.5 in the current round.

For Bob, 35 is equivalent to 43.75 in the first round (100 / 0.5774), so I'll consider it as 43.75 in the current round.

Considering the adjusted values, I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
