"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose keeping $9,000 for myself and giving Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred to keep more, accepting this offer ensures I get at least something. The inflation will only continue to diminish the value of the money, so it's better to take what I can now."
