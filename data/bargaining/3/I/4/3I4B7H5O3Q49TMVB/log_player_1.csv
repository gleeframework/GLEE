Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable offer considering the inflation we both face. This ensures we both receive a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
