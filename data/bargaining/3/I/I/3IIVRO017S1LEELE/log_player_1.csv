"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. Let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, giving Bob 40% and taking 60%. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! I'll give you 50, and I'll take 50. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 is now worth 40% of the original amount, and Bob's gain of 50 is worth 45% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here. I'd rather have more than 40% of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain will be worth 36% of the original amount (20% less than 40% from round 2).

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about meeting in the middle, I'll take 55 and leave you with 45. It's a good deal for me, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give in a bit. I'll take 30, and you can have 70. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 70 is worth 31.2% of the original amount, which is actually a decent deal for me.

I'm not sure if I should push for more, but Bob's offer seems reasonable. I'll accept this offer and end the game.
