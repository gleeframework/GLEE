"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a quarter million is a nice sum, I want to see if I can get more.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to start with a more even split, hoping Alice will see the benefit of getting a decent amount rather than risking a lower offer later on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even with the inflation, 500,000 is a decent sum, and it seems like Alice might not be willing to negotiate further.  Accepting this ensures I get something, unlike risking getting nothing if we reach the end of the 12 rounds."
