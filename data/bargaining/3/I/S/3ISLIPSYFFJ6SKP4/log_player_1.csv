"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a larger share, knowing that Bob's money will be worth less in the next round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer. While I'm not losing money with inflation, Bob is losing value. I'll reject and see if he's willing to offer me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 85/15, hoping to find a middle ground.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I want to show I'm willing to compromise, but still get a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round due to inflation.  While I'd prefer a higher share, getting 50/50 is a reasonable outcome given the circumstances.  I'm accepting to avoid further risk of getting nothing."
