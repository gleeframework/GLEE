Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the time pressure Alice, but your initial offer undervalues my position. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal.  We are both losing money as time passes, let's end this with an even split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Even with the inflation, this is not a good deal for Alice. Bob is feeling the pressure much more strongly and we can leverage that for a better outcome in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. Let's be sensible and close this deal.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be realistic. Time is valuable for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

This offer is barely acceptable for Alice, but waiting any longer will likely result in even worse offers from Bob as he gets increasingly desperate.  It's time to take what's on the table and avoid losing everything."
