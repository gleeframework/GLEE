"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but don't expect to get more than that.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give you all the power 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain would be 630,000 (70% of 900,000) and Bob's gain would be 270,000 (30% of 900,000).

I don't like this offer. I'd rather get more. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit desperate, aren't you? I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $900,000 (after inflation) and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not going to let you get away with this. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting off that easy! 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 73% of its original value, so the remaining amount is $730,000. 

I'm not impressed with this offer. I think I can do better. I'll reject it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""It's getting late, let's split it 50/50. I'm not getting any younger, and I'm not going to let you get the best of me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair deal given the circumstances."
