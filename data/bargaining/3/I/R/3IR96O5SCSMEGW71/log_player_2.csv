Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total amount is now 9,000$ for me and 9,500$ for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice, the total amount is now 8,160$ for me and 9,225$ for Alice.

My initial calculation was based on the original amounts, but considering the current values, Alice's offer is actually a good deal for me. I'll accept it.
