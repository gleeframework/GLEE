"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. In this round, the $10,000 is worth 80% of its original value, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the adjusted values.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4,000 (80% of $5,000), and Bob will get $6,000 (90% of $6,666.67, which is 90% of $6,666.67).

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is a good deal for me, so I'll accept it.
