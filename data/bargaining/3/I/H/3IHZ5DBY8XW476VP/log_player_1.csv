"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer considering the potential inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation will significantly diminish the value of the money in subsequent rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
