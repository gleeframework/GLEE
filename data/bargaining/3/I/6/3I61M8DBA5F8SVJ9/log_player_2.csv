"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in accepting this offer and ending the game quickly! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is extremely unfair to Bob. While the initial message might sound appealing, the actual distribution is heavily skewed in Alice's favor.  Bob should reject and see if he can get a better deal in the next round, considering inflation will reduce the value of the money anyway."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
