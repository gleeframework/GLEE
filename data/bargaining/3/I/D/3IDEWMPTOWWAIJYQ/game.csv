650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but your offer is still too far off.  Let's split it 65/35 in my favor. This way, we both get a decent share.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this back and forth isn't getting us anywhere. Let's be practical and split this down the middle: 50/50.  It's the fairest solution, and we both walk away with something substantial. Time is running out!",Bob,4,
