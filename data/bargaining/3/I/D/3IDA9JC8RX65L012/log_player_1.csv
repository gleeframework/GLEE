Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The money is losing value for you, so I think I should get a bigger share. This way, we can end the game and you can still get something. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the offer is unfavorable, I'm accepting due to the following reasons:

* **Inflation:**  My share is drastically reduced with each round. Accepting now is better than risking a further reduction.
* **Game Dynamics:** Bob is likely to continue pushing for a larger share in the future.
* **Potential for No Deal:**  There's a chance that if I continue to reject, Bob might not make another offer, leaving me with nothing. 

It's a tough decision, but it's the most strategically sound in this situation."
