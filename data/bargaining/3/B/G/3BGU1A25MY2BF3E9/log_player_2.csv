Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage, but her advantage is shrinking.  While I'm losing ground due to inflation, she's losing it faster. Holding out for a better deal still makes sense, but we're getting close to the point where I need to be careful and not get greedy."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  A perfectly even split. It's the most logical choice given the inflation. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time to play strong. Offering a 50/50 split is the fairest deal and highlights that continuing to play is hurting Alice more than me. By framing it as my ""final offer"" it puts pressure on Alice to accept and avoids further rounds of stressful negotiation."
