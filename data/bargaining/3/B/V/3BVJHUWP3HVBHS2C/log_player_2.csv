Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""That's a very generous offer, Alice, but hardly fair. How about I take 70 and you take 30?  It's important to find a balance.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be more realistic. I'll take 60, and you can have 40. This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
