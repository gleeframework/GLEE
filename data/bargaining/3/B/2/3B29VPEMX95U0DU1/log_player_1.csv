"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000 and I'll take $6,000, hoping he'll accept this reasonable split to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round. I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, Bob's offer of $4,000 for me is actually worth less than it was in the first round. Given that I initially offered him a 40% share and he rejected it, I'm not willing to accept the same share now that it's worth even less due to inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI've adjusted my offer to account for the inflation, offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, while still trying to maintain a fair split. I'm hoping this compromise will be more acceptable to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money."
