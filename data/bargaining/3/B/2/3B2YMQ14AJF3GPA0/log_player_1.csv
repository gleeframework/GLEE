"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement. I'm taking into account the inflation rates and aiming for a win-win situation in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a blatant attempt to turn the tables. While it's tempting to accept to avoid getting nothing in the end, I'm going to reject it.  My strategy is to be the one who makes the offer and control the negotiation.  By rejecting, I'll be in the driver's seat for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly but still offering a significant portion to Bob. I want to be fair, but I'm also aware of the decreasing value of money with each round. Hopefully, this offer will be appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very one-sided in his favor, even with the inflation factored in.  I need to continue to hold out for a better deal. I will continue to make offers in subsequent rounds, aiming for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm reducing my share further, but I'm still keeping a majority of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that with the inflation rate increasing, his share is decreasing rapidly.  I believe this offer is fair, considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly greedy.  While his offer is slightly better than the previous round, it's still heavily weighted in his favor. I'm going to reject this offer and continue to negotiate for a fairer split. I believe that with the increasing rate of inflation, he will eventually be forced to offer me a more reasonable amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still hoping to secure a deal. The inflation is hitting hard, and I need to make a deal before the money becomes worthless. I believe this offer is a fair compromise given the current situation."
