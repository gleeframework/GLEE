I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.
