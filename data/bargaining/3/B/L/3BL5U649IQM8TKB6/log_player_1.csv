"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to share a significant portion while considering the value erosion due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation to erode the value of our shares. Let's work together to ensure we both benefit from this division. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
