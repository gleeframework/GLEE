"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer and ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A more balanced offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, but I still have to make a decision.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing, and I need to make a move. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! Don't let it slip away!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: 50/50 split. Let's shake on it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to think carefully about my next move. A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
