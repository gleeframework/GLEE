"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 20%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, and I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a slightly better offer than the first one, I'm not getting a fair share considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is a more aggressive offer on my part, considering the reduced value of the money. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, it's a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a good compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it seems like a fair split considering the current value of the money."
