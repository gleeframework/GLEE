Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I want to get the majority of the money, but I'm also willing to leave Bob with something to encourage him to accept. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! While I'm taking a loss due to inflation, he's actually getting *more* money.  I'm not going to let him take advantage of me like that. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to increase my offer, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. I think this is a fair compromise given the inflation and Bob's previous attempt to take advantage.  Let's see if he's more reasonable this time."
