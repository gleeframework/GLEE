"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 95% of what I could have gained in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In this round, my potential gain is worth 90.25% of what I could have gained in the first round (95% of 95% = 90.25%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amount I'd gain in this round, considering the cumulative effect of inflation.

Initial gain: 80% of $100 = $80
Round 1 gain: 95% of $80 = $76
Round 2 gain: 95% of $76 = $72.20
Round 3 gain: 90.25% of $72.20 = $65.29
Round 4 gain: 85.74% of $65.29 = $56.04

So, in this round, my potential gain is worth 70.05% of what I could have gained in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it...
