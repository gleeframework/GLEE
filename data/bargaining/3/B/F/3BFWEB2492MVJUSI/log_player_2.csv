"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While a 60-40 split seems fair in the first round, the impact of inflation needs to be considered. Alice is getting a better deal over time with the money devaluing slower for her. I need to aim for a better split in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but we need to factor in the inflation. This offer is a compromise, giving me a slightly better starting point to account for the faster devaluation on my end.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still believe I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is barely budging, and the inflation is quickly eating into the potential gains.  Waiting any longer to push for a more significant change in my favor is a losing strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing with every round. This offer is a serious attempt to find a middle ground. Let's be realistic and close the deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the value is decreasing, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is my counteroffer, let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but the inflation is becoming critical. Accepting a 4400 offer now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds, especially if Alice is unwilling to budge significantly. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
