Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I propose a more balanced split of 60/40. This reflects the fact that the value of the money decreases for both of us as we negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split. However, the decreasing value of the money over time needs to be factored in more significantly.  I propose 52.5/47.5. This ensures we both benefit from reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.

# Bob gain: 525000
