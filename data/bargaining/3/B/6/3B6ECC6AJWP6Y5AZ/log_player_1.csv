"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 50/50, but this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value. Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to get a bit more for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I want a bit more for myself""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do a bit better than that, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do a bit better than 45, but I don't want to give him too much. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the reduced total. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Since Bob's last offer was 55-45, I'll try to get a bit closer to that, but I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the reduced total. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more""
}
