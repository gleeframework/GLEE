"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating with you! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gain.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too one-sided, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the reduced value of money.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, I'm taking a bigger risk with each round, I want a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll on my potential gain, and Bob is still pushing for a bigger share.

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll have to be even more cautious. However, I don't want to give up too much either.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I understand you're taking a risk, but I'm not willing to give up that much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now, and my potential gain is worth significantly less than it was initially. I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal to account for the reduced value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make up for the lost value due to inflation. This is my final offer.""
}
