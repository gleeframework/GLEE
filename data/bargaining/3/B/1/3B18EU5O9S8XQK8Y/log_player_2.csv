"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob, hoping it encourages a fair agreement. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this is a generous offer, I'm going to reject it.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The fact that there's inflation means waiting could be beneficial.  Even a small amount of inflation over 12 rounds could significantly increase my potential gains.
* **Power Dynamics:**  Rejecting the offer shows Alice I'm not easily swayed. It puts me in a position of power in the next round.

I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
