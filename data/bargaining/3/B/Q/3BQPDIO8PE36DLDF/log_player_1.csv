Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, Alice, but I'm also considering the inflation.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer isn't as good as Alice's initial proposal, it's important to remember the impact of inflation. 

* **Alice's perspective:** Waiting another round means her potential gain decreases by another 10%.  Accepting now secures a significant amount.
* **Bob's perspective:**  He's likely aware that Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and might be willing to accept a less favorable offer than she proposed in Round 1.

By accepting now, Alice avoids the risk of getting a much lower offer in subsequent rounds as the value of the money rapidly diminishes for both players."
