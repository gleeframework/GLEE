"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the value of going first.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm going first. The message ""Let's be fair and consider the value of going first"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and acknowledge the slight advantage I have by making the first offer. This approach sets the tone for a cooperative negotiation, encouraging Bob to consider the benefits of accepting a reasonable offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of going second. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven that I initially offered Bob a 60/40 split in my favor and he rejected it, it seems unreasonable for him to expect me to accept the same split in his favor, especially since the value of the money has decreased by 10% due to inflation. Accepting this offer would mean I end up with significantly less than what I initially proposed for myself, making it a less favorable deal for me. By rejecting this offer, I aim to negotiate a better split in the next round or potentially have Bob reconsider with a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation and fairness, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share than before, acknowledging his perspective that going second might have some value, and also taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. By proposing a 55/45 split, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob, while still recognizing my initial advantage of making the first offer. The message aims to reinforce the idea of seeking a fair and mutually acceptable agreement, encouraging Bob to consider the benefits of settling in this round rather than risking further devaluation."
