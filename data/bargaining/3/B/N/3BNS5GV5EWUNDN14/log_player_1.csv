I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me taking 900,000 and Bob taking 100,000. It's a fair start considering the inflation disadvantage I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my demand a bit to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob. This is still a better deal for me than Bob's last offer, and hopefully, it shows that I'm willing to compromise while still acknowledging the inflation disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's a much lower amount than I'd like, it's still better than the 48.8% loss I'd face if we continue to the next round. I need to accept this and secure some money."
