"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. The message is a friendly and conciliatory one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given my contribution to the game so far. Let's see if we can agree! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain would be 60 * 0.95 = 57 dollars, and Bob's gain would be 60 dollars.

I'm not interested in accepting a 40-60 split, as I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split. I'd like to propose a 55-45 split instead.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so my gain would be 57 * 0.95 = 54.15 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 55-45!""
}
```

I'm sticking to my proposal from Round 2, a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept it this time."
