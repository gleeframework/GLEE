Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's be practical and split it evenly this time - $50/$50.  Any further delays will only hurt you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
