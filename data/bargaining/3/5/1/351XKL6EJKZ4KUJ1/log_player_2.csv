"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's early in the game. While a 50/50 split is fair, I'm not sure how inflation affects Alice. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'd like to offer you 4000, and keep 6000 for myself. I believe this is a fair offer given the uncertainty of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is a good compromise. While I could potentially hold out for more, there's no guarantee she'll make a better offer in the future.  It's better to secure a good deal now, given the uncertainty of inflation."
