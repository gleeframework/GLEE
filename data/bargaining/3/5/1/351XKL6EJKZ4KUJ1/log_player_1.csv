I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to offer you 4000, and keep 6000 for myself. I believe this is a fair offer given the uncertainty of inflation.

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
