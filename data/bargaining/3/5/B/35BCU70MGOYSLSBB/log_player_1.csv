"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I'll need to think carefully. Since my gain is worth 10% less, I'll consider the actual amount I'll receive to be $4,500 (4000 / 0.9).

Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 1, and Bob's gains are worth 30% less than in Round 1. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'm trying to balance the offer and get a slightly higher share, considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains. Considering the effects of inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain is worth 27.1% less, so 5800 / 0.7279 ≈ 7961.11, but that's not the case, I'll just calculate the percentage of 5800 from 10000 which is 58%, then apply the inflation factor 0.7279 to that percentage, so 58% * 0.7279 ≈ 42.25%. 

Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, so 4200 / 0.5162 ≈ 8149.42, but that's not the case, I'll just calculate the percentage of 4200 from 10000 which is 42%, then apply the inflation factor 0.5162 to that percentage, so 42% * 0.5162 ≈ 21.67%. 

Considering the actual amounts, Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but I'll accept this offer since it's a relatively fair split, and the game is going on for too long.
