"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer
Given that the money loses 20% of its value for me (Alice) with each passing round, it's strategic to try and conclude the game as early as possible to minimize loss. However, the offer must be reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting it, as he doesn't lose any value over time.

### Step 2: Calculate the offer
A common approach in such games is to start with a proposal that slightly favors the proposer but is still reasonable for the other player. Considering the unique condition of inflation for me, I might want to start with a slightly higher offer to myself but still be mindful of Bob's perspective to encourage acceptance.

### Step 3: Formulate the message
The message should be concise and explain the reasoning behind the offer. Given the conditions, highlighting the benefit of accepting early for both parties could be a persuasive strategy.

### Step 4: Finalize the offer and message
Given the considerations, I will propose a division that gives me slightly more than half, considering the decreasing value for me over time, but not so much that Bob would be inclined to reject it outright.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Accepting now benefits both, as further rounds decrease my gain's value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. A fair deal ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the impact of inflation on the current offer
In the second round, the money I gain is worth 20% less. This means if I were to accept the 50/50 split, my actual gain in value from the first round's perspective would be 40 (since 50 * 0.8 = 40), while Bob's gain remains constant at 50.

### Step 2: Consider the implications of rejecting the offer
If I reject this offer, the game proceeds to the next round where I would make the proposal again. However, the money would lose another 20% of its value for me, making it even less desirable to prolong the game.

### Step 3: Weigh the pros and cons of accepting the current offer
Given that Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair under normal circumstances, and considering that further rounds decrease the value of my gain significantly, accepting this offer might be the most reasonable decision to minimize loss.

### Step 4: Decide on the course of action
Accepting the offer seems to be the best strategy at this point, as it ensures I receive a known quantity now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
