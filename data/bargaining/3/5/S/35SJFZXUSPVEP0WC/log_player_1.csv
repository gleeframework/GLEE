"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial 100$ (80$) and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but not too much since the money is worth less now 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 70$ is now worth 70 * 0.9 = 63$.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
