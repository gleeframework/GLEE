60.0,40.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'll come down to $60, and you get $40.  The clock is ticking, and we're both losing money with each round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of your greed.  Let's split this evenly and call it a day.",Bob,4,
