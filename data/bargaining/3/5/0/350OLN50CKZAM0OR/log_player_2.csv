"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Inflation is affecting us both, so a 50/50 split feels fair. This ensures we both get a decent amount, and it avoids further negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
