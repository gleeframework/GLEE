"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, Alice. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000
* Bob's gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
