Let's start with a fair 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'll try to get a slightly larger share, but still be relatively fair. Since I get to make the offer now, I can take advantage of the fact that my money is worth less in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm going to reject this offer. My money is worth significantly less now, and I still have a chance to make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm going to try to get a larger share this time, knowing that my money is worth even less now. While I'd prefer a more even split, I need to prioritize getting a decent amount while it's still possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is very uneven, my money is worth significantly less now.  It's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
