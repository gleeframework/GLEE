400000.0,600000.0,"That's a very generous offer, Alice, but how about we try something a little more equitable?  I'm feeling 60/40.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you more, but 60/40 is still too much. How about 80/20?  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",Alice,3,

700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking!  I'm not going to let the value of the money completely disappear. Let's make a deal now. I'm offering 70/30, which is a fair compromise given the current inflation. We're both losing a lot, let's take what we can get.",Alice,7,
