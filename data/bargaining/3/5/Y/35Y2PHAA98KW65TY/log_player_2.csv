**Reasoning:**

The game dynamics have shifted.  While ideally, Bob wanted more than $4,700, Alice is clearly playing a tough negotiating game.  

Here's why accepting is the best option now:

* **Inflation:** Every round makes Bob's potential gain less valuable. Waiting any longer significantly erodes the value of a deal.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message implies this is her bottom line.  Rejecting this offer risks her digging in further, leading to worse offers or even no agreement.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is growing. 

Taking $4,400 now might be less than ideal, but it's better than the increasingly likely outcome of getting nothing if the game continues."
