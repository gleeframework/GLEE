"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand your desire for a larger share.  Let's split it 60/40,  I get 60% and you get 40%. This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Bob). Accepting 40% now when it's worth significantly less than in Round 1 is not ideal.  I need to push for a better split while I still have some leverage."
