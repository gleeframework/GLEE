"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  While it's likely Bob will reject this offer, it establishes my dominance and sets the stage for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's tempting to try for more, accepting this offer ensures a significant gain for me. The risk of further rounds and the potential for inflation means that Bob might get a more favorable deal in the future.  This offer is a fair compromise and secures a substantial portion of the money."
