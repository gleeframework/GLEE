"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in the next rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively equal division of the initial $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject his offer, since it's still a 60-40 split, which is not what I was looking for.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
