"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split.  Let's move on from this initial negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I'll consider it. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now. I'll think of a new proposal that takes into account the decreased value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreased value of money, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50, and avoid further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
