"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and simple way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not interested in accepting an offer that gives me only 40% of the total amount. I think I deserve a better deal, especially since I'm the one who made the initial offer. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still think I deserve more""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer this time, while still keeping in mind that I'm the one who made the initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as I'm still getting a smaller share of the total amount. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal and try to negotiate a better deal."
