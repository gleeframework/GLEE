"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. But I'll go with it for now. 

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
