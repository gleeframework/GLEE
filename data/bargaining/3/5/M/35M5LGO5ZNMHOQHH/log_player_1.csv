"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. Accept and we can end the game.""
}

Round 2

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd be getting $5700 (3000 / 0.95). Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he'd be getting $5600 (7000 / 0.8).

I'm not sure I want to take a smaller share, but Bob's message suggests he's willing to end the game quickly. Let's see what he's thinking...
