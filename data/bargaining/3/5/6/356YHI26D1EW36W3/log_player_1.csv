"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'd receive in Round 2 would be:

My gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63
Bob's gain: 30 * 0.8 = 24

I'd rather not take a smaller share, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. Here's my new proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd receive in Round 4, considering the inflation effect:

My gain: 50 * 0.723 (since 100 * 0.271 = 27.1% less) = 36.15
Bob's gain: 50 * 0.516 (since 100 * 0.488 = 48.8% less) = 25.8

I'd rather not take a smaller share, and the fact that Bob is offering a 50-50 split is tempting. I'll accept this offer.
