"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to start negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob a relatively small share to see how he reacts and to set the tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get the same amount, and we can move on with our day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable proposal.

I accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
