"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 70:30 split in favor of Alice. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60:40 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation. I'll give you a slight advantage, but I still want a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
