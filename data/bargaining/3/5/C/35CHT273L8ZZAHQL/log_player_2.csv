"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:** While the inflation affects my gains significantly (36% less), it also impacts Alice's gain (19% less). 
* **Relative Value:**  Although my share is smaller than in the first round, it's still a significant amount of money after considering inflation. 
* **Risk of Rejection:**  Rejecting this offer means risking that Alice might offer me even less in the next round, making it less beneficial to me.

By accepting, I secure a decent amount of money, considering the inflation factor and the risk of a worse offer in the future."
