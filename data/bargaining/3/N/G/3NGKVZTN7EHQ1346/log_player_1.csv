"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% of the money. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount. The message is just a friendly nudge to see if Bob will accept the offer."
