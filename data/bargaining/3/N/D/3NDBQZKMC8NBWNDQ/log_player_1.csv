Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  Since we don't know how inflation affects him, it's in my best interest to secure a deal early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I think this is a fair and safe option.  There's no guarantee that Bob will be generous in future rounds, and given the inflation factor, I could end up with less than $50."
