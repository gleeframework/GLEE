"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty lopsided offer in my favor, as the inflation will benefit me more in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is not great for me, it's better than the 20% inflation I would face if I reject and go to the next round."
