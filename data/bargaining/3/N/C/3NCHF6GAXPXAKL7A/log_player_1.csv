"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you $100,000 to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fairer starting point.  Let's work from there. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute amounts. A 60-40 split is more favorable to me than the 90-10 split I initially proposed, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. A 70-30 split seems reasonable to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between a fair split and a good outcome for myself."
