6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'm willing to take a bit more since I'm making the first offer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,Your split seems a bit unbalanced to me. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's still in your best interest to accept considering the inflation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle between my first offer and your counteroffer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Okay, Alice, I see you're serious about negotiating.  Let's try this: 4700 for me, 5300 for you.  It's a decent bump for me, and you'll still be getting a good chunk before inflation eats away too much.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"I appreciate the bump, but I'm still not convinced. Considering the growing inflation, I'll try to find a middle ground again. Let's see if we can settle on this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is fair, simple, and avoids further losses due to inflation. Take it or leave it, but we need to decide now.",Bob,6,
