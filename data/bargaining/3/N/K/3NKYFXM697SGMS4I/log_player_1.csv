Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**Bob's Offer (Round 2)**

* **Alice Gain:** $400,000 (worth 20% less in the next round)
* **Bob Gain:** $600,000 (worth 10% less in the next round)

**My Reasoning**

* **Time Pressure:** We're losing money each round. Waiting is risky.
* **Future Offers:** If I reject, I need to be confident I can get Bob to accept a deal where I get more than $400,000 (after its value decreases) in the next few rounds. Will he be willing to give up more as time goes on?
* **Greed vs. Risk:**  I could gamble for more, but there's a chance we both end up with nothing.

**Decision:** It's a close call, but the risk of getting zero is too high.
