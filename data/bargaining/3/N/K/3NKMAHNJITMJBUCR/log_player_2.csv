"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it close to 60/40. This way we both win and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I'm aware of the inflation. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""I'm going to take a bit more than 60% now, as we both know inflation is happening and my share is shrinking with every round. Let's get this done."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is working against you, but your previous ask was too greedy.  This offer is a compromise that still benefits you to settle quickly.  
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is making my share smaller each round.  It's better to take the offer and get something than risk getting nothing in the next round."
