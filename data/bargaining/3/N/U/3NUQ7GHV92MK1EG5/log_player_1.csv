"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is now worth less than my original proposal of 600,000. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55-45 split, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually a 40-60 split, which is less favorable to me than my previous offer. Given the reduced value of the money, I'll have to consider the long-term implications of accepting this offer.

After some thought, I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is really biting now! My offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000
}
```

This is a 47.5-52.5 split, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm trying to be cautious and not give up too much, while also being realistic about the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on the money's value now! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal.

However, I also know that I have limited time left to make a decision, and accepting this offer would at least give me some money. The 30-70 split is still not ideal, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the future.

After some thought, I'll accept it.
