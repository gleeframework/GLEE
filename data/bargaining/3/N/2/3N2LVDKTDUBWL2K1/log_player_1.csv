"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% gain for myself, especially considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I still want a decent share.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the ratio to 60/40 in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
