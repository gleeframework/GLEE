**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the negotiation goes, the more money we both lose.  A 43/57 split now is better than holding out for a slightly better deal later only to have inflation erode the gains. 
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice has moved closer to the middle ground, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks Alice becoming more resolute in later rounds. We might be forced to accept a worse deal or walk away with nothing. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting ensures a reasonable payout considering the circumstances."
