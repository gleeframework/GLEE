Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I believe I can leverage the time pressure to secure a better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a fair 50/50 split.  The value is decreasing with each round. Let's end this now before it's too late.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time for a strong stance. A 50/50 split is objectively fair and emphasizes the urgency of the situation.  Alice might be more willing to accept a less favorable deal now that the devaluation is becoming more significant."
