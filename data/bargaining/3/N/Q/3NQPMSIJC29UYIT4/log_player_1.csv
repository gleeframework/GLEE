"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and keep the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly, minimizing the impact of inflation."
