"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount this round, but I'm willing to increase my offer if you accept this one. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to consider the value of the money more carefully.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially since I know that Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this round, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, trying to balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal while still getting a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a relatively small share this round, but I'm trying to get closer to my target. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain even more significantly in this round, I need to reassess the value of the money.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20/80 split, especially since Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to the higher inflation rate. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give up too much more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me, while still being a reasonable compromise."
