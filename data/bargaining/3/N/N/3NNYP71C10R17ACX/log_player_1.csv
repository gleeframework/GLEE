"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased by 10%!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not too thrilled about the 75-25 split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather get a better deal, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round with the money's value decreasing further.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
