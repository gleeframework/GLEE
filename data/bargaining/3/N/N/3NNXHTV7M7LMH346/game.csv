9000.0,1000.0,"I'm feeling generous, Bob.  Let's start with a 90/10 split.  I think this is a fair deal that allows us both to walk away with something.  What do you say?",Alice,1,

8500.0,1500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's get serious. I understand we both want a good share, but I'm not willing to settle for a 20% cut.  I'm offering 85/15 this time. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but we need to find a solution that's fair for both of us. What do you think?",Alice,3,

3000.0,7000.0,"You're not budging, I see. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this. I'm offering a 70/30 split. It's the best I'm willing to do. Take it or leave it!",Bob,4,

7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm still not happy with the 30% offer, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 75/25. It's the best I can do. If you reject this, I'm not sure we'll be able to find a solution before the money is gone entirely. What do you say?",Alice,5,

4000.0,6000.0,"You're getting desperate, Alice. I can see that. But I'm not going to back down. I'm still not happy with the 25% offer, so I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this. I'm offering a 60/40 split. That's my final offer. Take it or leave it!",Bob,6,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, we're getting close to the end.  I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement if we continue to be so inflexible.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 65/35 split.  I think this is the best chance we have to walk away with something.  Let's be reasonable and end this before we lose everything.",Alice,7,
