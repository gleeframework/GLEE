580000.0,420000.0,"Considering the inflation, I'll make a slight adjustment. This is my new offer.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Okay, Alice, I see how this is going. I'm willing to be very generous one last time.  52-48, take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
570000.0,430000.0,"You said that was your last generous offer, but I think you can do better considering the inflation is really hurting your share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split to end this nonsense.  I strongly suggest you take it before the inflation eats away at any chance of a reasonable agreement.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
590000.0,410000.0,"I understand your frustration, but considering the massive hit your share is taking from inflation, I think it's only fair I take a bit more. This is my new offer.",Alice,7,

,,,Alice,8,reject
620000.0,380000.0,"You've made it clear you're willing to walk away, but I think you'll still take a small share rather than nothing. This is my new offer, considering the devastating effect inflation is having on your potential earnings.",Alice,9,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is it.  I'm sticking to my word.  50/50, take it or leave it.  It's your last chance for a deal - don't be greedy and let's both walk away with something!",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"I understand you're trying to hold firm, but the reality is, inflation has decimated your share's value. I'm taking a larger cut, and you should be grateful I'm still offering you something.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is absolutely your FINAL chance. I've offered 50/50 multiple times, and I'm sticking to it. Accept this offer so we BOTH get something, or we BOTH walk away with NOTHING. The clock is ticking... literally.",Bob,12,
