"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less this round, my offer would be equivalent to $540,000 in the first round, which is more than Bob's offer of $500,000 in this round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
