This is a tough decision, but here's why it's the right move:

* **Inflation is Hurting You More:** The longer this goes on, the more you lose out. Another round means another 5% decrease in value for you, while Bob only loses 10%. 
* **Bob's Offer is Getting Closer to Fair:** While not ideal, his offer is getting closer to reflecting the inflation differential.  It's unlikely he'll offer significantly better in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in Round 5 is risky. Bob might dig in, and even a slightly improved offer then might be worse than accepting now. 

This is a classic example of negotiation where understanding the underlying factors (in this case, inflation) is crucial to making a good decision."
