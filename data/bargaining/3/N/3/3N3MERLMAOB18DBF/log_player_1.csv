"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority and you can have the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the 100$ and Bob gets 30%. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this more evenly. I'll take slightly more since I'm the one making the offer this round, but I'm willing to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45$ is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 55$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80%), and I'm not sure how much Bob's gain is worth.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money. I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split, hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
