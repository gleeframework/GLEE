"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I figure that even though he gets a tiny share, it's better than nothing, and it should encourage him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer and I don't see a better outcome for me.  The inflation factor makes it risky to reject and try to get more in a later round."
