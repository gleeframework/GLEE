Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be greedy! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential winnings decreases. While her offers are inching closer to a more even split, I believe I can still pressure her into a better deal for me in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair and end this. A 50/50 split is the most logical choice. Don't risk losing everything.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out, and Alice's offers are getting closer to a fair split. Offering a 50/50 split now:

* **Maximizes the chance of acceptance:**  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and wants to avoid getting nothing.
* **Is fair:**  It demonstrates a willingness to compromise and avoids appearing overly greedy. 
* **Is decisive:**  It avoids further rounds and the risk of a stalemate."
