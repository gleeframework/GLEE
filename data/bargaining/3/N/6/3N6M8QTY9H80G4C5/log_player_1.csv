"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the lion's share, but it's still a good deal for you!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation we both need to be mindful of. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 55/45 split is fair, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'd like to propose a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more. This is a fair 60/40 split.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob getting the remaining 40%, which is $400,000."
