"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and straightforward proposal, offering Bob a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new proposal. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, which is a disadvantage for him.

Considering the message, it seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob was trying to get a better deal for himself in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that's slightly less generous. However, I'll still try to maintain a reasonable balance between our gains.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but not as large as his previous offer. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's gain is now worth even less than before. I'll have to consider whether this new offer is acceptable.

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation. However, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential benefits of continuing to negotiate.

Considering Bob's message, it seems he's still trying to get a better deal. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's gain is worth significantly less than mine due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself, considering the decreased value of Bob's potential gain.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you at a slightly higher ratio""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight advantage for myself. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable compromise, given the changing circumstances due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not giving me enough, let's try to squeeze a bit more out of this deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal for himself, despite the significant decrease in value of his potential gain due to inflation. With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, I'm in a relatively strong position.

Considering the message, it seems Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. However, I'm not inclined to give in to his demands, especially since he's already getting a relatively large share.

I'll make a decision based on the current state of the game.
