"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet! I want to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to take a toll! The money is worth less and less each round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight edge. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, but I'm still open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about finding a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

However, I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better than my previous one. Considering the inflation, I'd rather wait for a more substantial proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not giving in just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting scarcer and scarcer due to inflation!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up on getting a slightly better deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, but I'm still hoping to squeeze out a tiny advantage."
