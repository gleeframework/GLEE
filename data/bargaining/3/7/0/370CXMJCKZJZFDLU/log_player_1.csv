"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased due to inflation, but I still get to keep more than Bob.

I accept Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
