Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd rather take a little more risk and see if we can get a better deal. I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting my slightly greater risk with the inflation rate. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is the inverse of mine, but the inflation is hurting him more. Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** I get $4,000, which is not ideal, but it's better than nothing.
* **Rejecting:** I risk getting a worse offer in the next round, and the value for both of us will decrease. However, Bob is getting hit harder by inflation, which might make him more open to a compromise later.

Considering the decreasing value and Bob's riskier position, I'm inclined to take the gamble.
