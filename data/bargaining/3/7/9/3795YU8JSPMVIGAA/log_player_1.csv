"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the original $10,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my strategy accordingly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, and I'll make my own proposal for Round 3."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the current value of the money, leaving 40% for Bob."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than its original value, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think for a moment...
