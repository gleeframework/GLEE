"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $6,000 gain in the first round is now worth 90% of that, which is $5,400. And Bob's $4,000 gain is now worth 80% of that, which is $3,200.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have a gain of $2,000, which is worth 90% of $2,200, and Bob will have a gain of $8,000, which is worth 80% of $10,000.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my previous gain of $5,400 is now worth 90% of that, which is $4,860. I'll make a new offer to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 50% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,000, and leaving $5,000 for Bob."
