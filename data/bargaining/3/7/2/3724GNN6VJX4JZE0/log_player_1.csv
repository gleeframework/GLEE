Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a very aggressive strategy, but I believe it is the best way to maximize my potential gain in this first round. As the game progresses, the value of the money will decrease, so I want to secure as much as possible right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is incredibly generous, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion. I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds.  I'll keep pushing for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm taking a more moderate approach this time.  I'm offering Bob a small increase from the previous round, hoping to find a middle ground. This should demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise while still securing a significant portion of the money."
