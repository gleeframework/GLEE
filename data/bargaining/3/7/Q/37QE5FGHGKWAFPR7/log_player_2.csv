"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 into $7500 for me and $2500 for you. This way, we can share the wealth fairly while considering the potential loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $2500, it's better to see if Alice will be willing to offer a better deal in the next round.  There's a chance she might give more to avoid the risk of getting nothing later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
