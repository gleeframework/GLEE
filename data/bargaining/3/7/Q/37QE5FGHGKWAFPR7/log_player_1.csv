"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I believe it's a fairer reflection of the potential for inflation. This way we both get a significant portion of the money.  Let's make a deal and avoid the risk of getting nothing! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
