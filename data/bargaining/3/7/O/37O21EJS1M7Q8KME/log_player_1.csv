Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game going!"

# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm hoping you'll be generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30
