"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more, huh?

I'm not sure I agree, but I'll consider the offer. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather get something now than risk waiting for a better offer.
