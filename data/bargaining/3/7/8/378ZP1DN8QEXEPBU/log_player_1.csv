"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is not as good as my initial offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

After considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit better than my previous one, but I'm not convinced it's the best I can get. I'll reject it again and try to negotiate further.
