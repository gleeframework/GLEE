"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While my gain is worth 19% less due to inflation, I'm still getting a significant amount of money. 
* **Fairness:** This offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome considering the risk of further rounds.  
* **Risk:** If I reject this offer, Alice might offer me a worse deal in the next round, and the inflation will continue to devalue my potential gains."
