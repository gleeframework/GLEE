Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I know it's a big chunk, but I'm taking the risk of inflation into account and want to secure a good portion for myself early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, with inflation, taking 500,000 is a better deal than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
