Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split close to 50/50, but I get a little extra since the value decreases over time for me. This way we both benefit.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to offer you 4800$, which is still a fair split. It's important that we both get something, and since the value of the money will decrease for me, I need a little more to make it worthwhile. Let's be reasonable and finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
