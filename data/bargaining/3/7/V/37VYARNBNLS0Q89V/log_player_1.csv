I'm going for a slightly unfair offer to see how Bob reacts.  He's getting 10% of the money, but it's better than nothing, and he's going to have to negotiate hard to get a better deal in the next round if he rejects this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him, but it's still not a good deal for me. The inflation has made the money I'm getting worth significantly less, and I'm still getting a much smaller share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try to get a better deal in this round. I'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is still a good deal for him considering he's got to take into account the inflation and the fact that he's getting closer to the end of the game."
