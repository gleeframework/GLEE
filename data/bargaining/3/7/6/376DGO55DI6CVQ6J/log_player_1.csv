"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards his gain, I'll reject it for now. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's share is now 70, which is a significant majority, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or wait for a better one.

After considering the current state of the game, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 57.5,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
