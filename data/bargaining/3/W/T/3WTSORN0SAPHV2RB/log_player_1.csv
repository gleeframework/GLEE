"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  While I want a good share of the money, I also want to avoid a situation where we both end up with nothing.  We have a lot of rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, and I'm not going to accept it.  I'm confident I can do better than that, especially considering the inflation factor.  It's time to show Bob that I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still maintain a significant advantage.  Bob needs to understand that I'm not going to accept unfair deals.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being stubborn, but I'm not going to give in to his demands. His offer is still unfair, even with the inflation factor. I'm not going to accept anything less than a 50/50 split. I'm confident we can reach a more equitable agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to make another offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  I'm going to lower my desired gain a bit, but still maintain a significant advantage.  Bob needs to understand that I'm serious about getting a fair share of the money, and we're running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. I'm not going to accept anything less than a 50/50 split. Even with the inflation factor, we're both losing a significant amount of money if we don't come to an agreement soon. I'm going to try to convince Bob that we need to find a compromise, otherwise, we'll both be left with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

We are running out of time! I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and offer a 50/50 split. This is the only way to ensure that we both get something, and it's the fairest solution given the circumstances. If Bob rejects this, we are both going to lose a significant amount of money due to inflation. Let's hope he sees reason."
