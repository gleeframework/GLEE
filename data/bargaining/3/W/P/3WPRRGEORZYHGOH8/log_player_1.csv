"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 5% less, I think this offer is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal. I'll accept the offer.
