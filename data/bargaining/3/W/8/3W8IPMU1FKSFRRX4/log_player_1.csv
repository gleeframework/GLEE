"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'm willing to give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60 is a bit steep. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my desire for a larger share with the need to keep Bob from getting too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I think 52 is the most I'm willing to give up. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, but still keep the door open for a potential deal."
