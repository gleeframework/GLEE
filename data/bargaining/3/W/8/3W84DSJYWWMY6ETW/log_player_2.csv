```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding out for a 60/40 split in her favor. Given the rapid inflation working against me, waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal. It's painful to lose so much value, but getting $40 is better than nothing, which is what we'll both get if we don't reach an agreement in the next 7 rounds."
