Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and leaves plenty of room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 5000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I propose a 6000/4000 split in my favor.  It's a fair compromise after Bob's last offer, and leaves plenty of time to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I propose a 5500/4500 split in my favor. This is a more balanced offer than my previous one, and takes into account the ongoing inflation. I believe it's a fair compromise that gives us both a decent share of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, given the continuous inflation, I think accepting this offer is the best option. We are getting close to the deadline and there's a chance we might lose everything if we keep rejecting."
