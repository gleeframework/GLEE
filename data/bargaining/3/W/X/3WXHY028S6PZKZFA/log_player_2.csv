"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 999000 and you can have 1000.  We can work out a better deal later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round.  Even with inflation, a 1000$ gain is likely not worth it.  The next round allows for a better chance of negotiating a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
