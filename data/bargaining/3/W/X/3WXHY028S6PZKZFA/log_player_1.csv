Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take 550000 and you can have 450000. This is a fair split, and it allows us to both get a significant share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
