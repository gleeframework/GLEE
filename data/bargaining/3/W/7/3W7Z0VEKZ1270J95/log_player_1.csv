"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, but I'm also leaving Bob with a significant amount, so he might be inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is being very even-handed. My proposal from Round 1 didn't work out, so I'll have to reassess. With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to get a bigger share.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm taking a bigger risk by offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy.

Considering the offers I've made so far, and the fact that Bob's offer is still quite even-handed, I think I'll accept this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
