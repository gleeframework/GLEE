"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 300,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 700,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 84% of the original value, so I'd get 588,000 dollars, and Bob would get 600,000 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
