Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty lopsided split in my favor.  I figure since I'm going first, I can take a big chunk.  However, I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much more fair offer, and I'm happy to accept it.  The inflation is starting to kick in, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
