"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but still leaves a small amount for Bob. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a quick deal, or if he's going to try to negotiate for a larger share."
