"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of $7,000 is actually worth $6,650 (since 95% of $7,000 is $6,650).

I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
