"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle!""}\n\nI've made an offer that is slightly in my favor, but still relatively fair. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me with each passing round, so I want to try to get a bit more. However, I'm also trying to be reasonable and leave room for negotiation. Let's see what Alice thinks!"
