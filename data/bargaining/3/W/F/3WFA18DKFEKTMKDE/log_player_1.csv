"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it. I'm taking advantage of the fact that he doesn't know about the inflation, and might be willing to accept a small amount early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  I know the inflation will only hurt me more in later rounds, and this deal still gives me a significant portion of the money."
