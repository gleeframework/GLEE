"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 4:1, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take a quick gain, the inflation risk is too high. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's start from a more balanced position.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk of inflation. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept this offer. While I would still prefer a larger share, it's a significant improvement from the previous round. The inflation risk is real, and accepting this offer will guarantee me a decent amount of money."
