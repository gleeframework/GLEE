"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get a better share, let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too greedy, Bob! I'm not selling out that cheaply.""
}
```

I'm not going to accept this offer, hoping Bob will come back with a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make another offer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I need to be careful.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've convinced me. Deal!""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. The numbers are getting smaller, but it's better to wrap up the deal and get something than to keep negotiating."
