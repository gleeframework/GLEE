"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me $80 and Bob $20. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game underway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This seems like the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is still $100, but I'll get 95% of the value of the $50 Bob is offering, which is $47.50. So, the effective split would be:

* My gain: $47.50
* Bob's gain: $50

I'm not too thrilled about this proposal, but it's still a better offer than what I got in Round 1. I'll accept it for now.
