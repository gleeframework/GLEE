"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I'd like to try to get a better deal. My current offer was already a generous one, and I'd like to see if I can get a better split.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob. Considering this, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, giving me 70% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll reassess Bob's new offer.

With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the decreased value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a relatively better deal for me considering the inflation.
