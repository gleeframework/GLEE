"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to maximize my share while still considering Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
