"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk to begin with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the initial offer, I'd rather see if I can get a better deal later on. The inflation might be worse for me, but I still have 11 more rounds to try and negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid losing too much to inflation.""
