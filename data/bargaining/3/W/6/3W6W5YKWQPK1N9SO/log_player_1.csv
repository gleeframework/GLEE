"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's switch the roles and see what you propose. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, especially since it's a worse deal for me than the initial proposal. However, I don't want to give up too much more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to adjust my proposal to account for the decreasing value. I'll aim for a slightly better split than the 60-40 I initially proposed.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55-45 split. I'm feeling generous, but I can't go any lower. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less for me, I'm getting a bit more desperate. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob the upper hand.

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I think it's slightly better than the 60-40 he initially proposed. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits.
