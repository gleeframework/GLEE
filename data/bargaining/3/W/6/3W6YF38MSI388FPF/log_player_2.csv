"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we start with a reasonable split where I take $650,000 and you take $350,000.  This gives us both a good chunk of the money upfront. Consider that the value decreases quickly with each round, so starting strong benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair share, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from our previous offers: I'll take $550,000, and you get $450,000. This ensures we both walk away with a significant amount, and it avoids further losses from inflation. Time is literally money in this game. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
