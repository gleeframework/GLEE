"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the new values are:

Alice's gain: $5000 (worth 90% of $6000)
Bob's gain: $5000 (worth 90.91% of $5500)

I'm not sure I want to give up my advantage, but Bob's offer is a fair one. I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger""
}
```

I'm trying to maintain a slight advantage, but still offering a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect much more 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: $5200 (worth 86.67% of $6000)
Bob's gain: $4800 (worth 87.27% of $5500)

Considering the decreasing values, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
