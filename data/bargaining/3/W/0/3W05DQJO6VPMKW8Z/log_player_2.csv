Let's see what Alice offers next!  It's worth holding out to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try and be a little more aggressive and see if I can get a bigger share, while still being reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a larger share, I think it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  The inflation is starting to bite, and Alice seems to be holding firm. It's better to take what I can get now."
