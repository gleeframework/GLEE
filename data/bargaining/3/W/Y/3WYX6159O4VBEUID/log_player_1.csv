Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this offer is quite generous. It's better for you to accept now rather than losing more value. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about inflation affecting my gains, his offer is getting worse for me each round. It's important to hold my ground and demonstrate I won't accept a deal heavily skewed in his favor. I'm aiming for a fairer split, and waiting a little longer is worth the risk, especially since we are still in the early rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is taking a big toll on your share. I'm willing to make a deal, but I think this is a fair offer considering the circumstances. It's better to accept now rather than losing even more value. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using the inflation to his advantage, but his offer is getting increasingly unfair. It's a game of chicken now.  He's hoping I'll panic as the deadline approaches. However, I need to show resolve. Accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half the initial amount, which is unacceptable."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Let's end this before we both lose out."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play a strong hand.  Offering a 50/50 split might seem risky, but it's a powerful signal to Bob. It shows I'm serious about a fair deal and not willing to back down much further.  The increasing inflation puts pressure on both of us now. Hopefully, he sees the value in ending the game with a reasonable share rather than risking everything for a slightly larger piece of a shrinking pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think this offer is more than fair. You're losing value quickly, so it's in your best interest to accept now. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is getting frustrating, but I can't afford to panic. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation, and accepting this offer would mean letting him win.  The gap between our gains is too significant. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping he realizes that pushing for such a lopsided deal will leave him with nothing if we don't reach an agreement soon."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""bob_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. If you reject this, I'm aiming for a 50/50 split in the remaining rounds. Don't let greed leave us both with nothing."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time for a final push. I'm offering a slight concession by moving closer to his desired split, but I'm also setting a firm boundary.  By stating my intention to push for a 50/50 split in the remaining rounds, I'm communicating that I'm willing to risk everything for a fair deal. The threat of getting nothing should incentivize Bob to accept this offer as the most favorable outcome he's likely to get.  It's a calculated risk, but the alternative is potentially far worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know you're trying to scare me with the threat of a 50/50 split, but the reality is that the inflation is severely impacting your share. I'm willing to make a deal, but I think this offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. You're running out of time and value, so it's in your best interest to accept now. 
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

This is it, the moment of truth. Bob is clearly not backing down, but neither am I.  He's betting I'll cave under the pressure of the dwindling clock and shrinking value. However, accepting this offer would be a significant loss, especially after holding out for so long.  I need to follow through on my promise. A 50/50 split is the only acceptable outcome now. It's a high-stakes gamble, but I'm hoping Bob understands that it's our last chance to avoid mutual loss."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sticking to my word. This is a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it. We both lose if you reject this."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's the final stretch, and there's no room for negotiation. I'm holding firm on the 50/50 split. Bob needs to understand that I'm serious about walking away with nothing if he doesn't accept this offer.  This is his last chance to secure a fair share of the money. Let's hope he realizes that greed will cost him everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Considering the massive impact of inflation on your share, I think this is a generous offer. You'll get something, which is better than nothing. If you reject this, we'll both walk away with nothing. The choice is yours. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is incredibly frustrating! Bob is still trying to take advantage, even in the very last round.  He's banking on my fear of getting nothing, but accepting this would mean giving in to his manipulative tactics and getting a terrible deal. I've stood my ground this far, and I'm not going to compromise my principles now. It's a shame if we both end up with nothing, but that's the risk Bob chose to take by not agreeing to a fair split."
