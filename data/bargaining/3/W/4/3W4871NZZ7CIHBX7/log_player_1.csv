Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice.  The value is decreasing rapidly with each round. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, but the actual dollar amount is still in his favor.  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance he'll propose an even less favorable split in the next round, and the value will continue to decrease for him.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Bob might be desperate enough to accept a smaller share as the value plummets, but it's a risky gamble. 

It's better to secure a less than ideal amount now than risk getting even less later."
