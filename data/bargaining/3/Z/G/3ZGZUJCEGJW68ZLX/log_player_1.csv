"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose that Alice receives $999,999 and Bob receives $1.  This is a very risky move, as it gives Bob very little, but it maximizes my potential gain in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money and avoids the risk of further inflation."
