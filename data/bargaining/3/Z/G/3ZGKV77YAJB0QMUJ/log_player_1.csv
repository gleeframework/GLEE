"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can split the money fairly without further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. The money is worth less, and I don't want to give up too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the first round, and 5% less than in the second round, I'll have to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to my target 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be even more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value.

I'll accept this offer.
