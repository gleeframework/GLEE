"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. It's a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I receive 6,000 and Bob receives 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a simple and efficient solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, the actual amount he's offering me is 5000 * (1 - 0.20) = 4000.

In this case, I'm not thrilled about the proposal, as I was hoping to get a bit more. However, Bob's message about splitting the money evenly does make sense, and it's a simple solution.

I'll decide to...
