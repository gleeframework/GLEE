"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation will benefit me more in the next round. This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we don't risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
