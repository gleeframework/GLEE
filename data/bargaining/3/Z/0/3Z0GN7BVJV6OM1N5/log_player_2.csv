"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that the value decreases for me with each round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation will benefit me more in the next round. This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we don't risk losing everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a bigger hit with the inflation. 55/45 is a compromise, and it's better than risking everything with further delays. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer a 60/40 split, accepting this offer is the best course of action. The inflation is hurting Alice more than me, and delaying further risks losing everything."
