40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation will benefit me more in the next round. This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we don't risk losing everything.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a bigger hit with the inflation. 55/45 is a compromise, and it's better than risking everything with further delays.",Alice,3,
