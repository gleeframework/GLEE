**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, the deal is still not favorable to us given the rapid inflation working against her.  She's feeling the pressure more and we can likely get a better deal as the rounds progress."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 570000,
""alice_gain"": 430000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and this is a reasonable offer given the shrinking pot. Let's close the deal.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Point:** Alice is experiencing much higher inflation. Each round she delays significantly hurts her potential gain, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal.
* **Shifting Advantage:** While we've rejected her previous offers, the tide is turning in our favor. Our offer is a compromise, but it leans more towards us now because of the time pressure.
* **Avoiding Disaster:** We're getting closer to the deadline. Holding out for too long risks getting nothing at all. This offer balances risk and reward."
