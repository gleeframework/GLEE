"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While 50,000 is a decent amount of money, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal. I want to see if I can push for a higher percentage. Also, since the money is worth 10% less each round, it makes sense to try and negotiate a better deal before inflation erodes the value of my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm willing to share the money more evenly. This offer is a good starting point for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  This is a fair split, and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to secure more than 400,000, it's clear that Alice is not going to budge much further. Inflation has already eroded the value of the money, and continuing to reject offers could lead to even smaller gains in the future. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a significant portion of the money."
