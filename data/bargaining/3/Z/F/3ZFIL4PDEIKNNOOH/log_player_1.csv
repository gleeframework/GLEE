"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my gain of 450,000 is worth 0.9 * 450,000 = 405,000, and Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 0.8 * 550,000 = 440,000.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```
This way, I'll get a slightly higher share than Bob's previous offer, taking into account the reduced value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains in this round:

My gain of 520,000 is worth 0.727 * 520,000 = 378,760 (27.1% less than the original 1,000,000).
Bob's gain of 480,000 is worth 0.516 * 480,000 = 247,808 (48.8% less than the original 1,000,000).

I'll accept this offer.
