"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 9000$ for myself and give Bob 1000$. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we're both taking a risk by playing this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred more, my share is still worth 5000 * 0.9 = 4500, which is more than what I would have gotten if I had rejected Bob's offer in the previous round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a gain."
