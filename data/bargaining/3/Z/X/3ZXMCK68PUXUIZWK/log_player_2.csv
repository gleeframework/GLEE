"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing money each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more since you're losing value each round""}\n###\n\nSince Alice's money is worth 10% less each round, I'm trying to put some pressure on her to accept a deal that's slightly more favorable to me. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. I'm losing money fast here, and this offer still gives you a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, although Alice is losing money due to inflation, her offer doesn't give me a significantly better deal than her initial proposal. I'm willing to take the risk to see if I can get a more favorable offer in the next round. Since Alice's money is worth less with each passing round, she may be more inclined to accept a deal that's more advantageous to me. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""You're losing value fast, and I'm not getting any younger. I think this is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm taking into account the fact that Alice's money is worth even less due to inflation (now 19% less than the initial round). Given this, I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is reasonable. I'm also trying to convey a sense of urgency with my message, implying that I'm not willing to drag out the negotiations much further. Let's see if Alice will accept this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer before inflation eats up all the profit! It's still a win for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's message is getting more urgent and the offer still seems favorable to me at first glance, considering the significant loss of value her share is experiencing due to inflation (now 34.39% less than the initial round), I believe I can push for an even better deal. My previous offer was for a 60-40 split in my favor, and given the increasing pressure of inflation on Alice's share, I'm inclined to think she might be willing to compromise further to secure a deal before her potential earnings diminish even more. Thus, I'm rejecting this offer to see if I can negotiate an even more advantageous split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Inflation is really taking its toll on your share. This is a fair offer considering the current circumstances. It's time to make a deal.""}\n###\n\nGiven the substantial impact of inflation on Alice's potential earnings (now worth 34.39% less than in the first round), I'm increasing my proposed share to 65%, leaving Alice with 35%. My reasoning is that the pressure of diminishing value might motivate Alice to accept a deal that is less favorable to her than previous offers but still better than risking further devaluation of her potential share. The message emphasizes the urgency and fairness of the offer, aiming to persuade Alice that it's in her best interest to accept this proposal before the situation worsens."
