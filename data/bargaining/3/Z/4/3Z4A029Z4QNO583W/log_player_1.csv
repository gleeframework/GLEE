"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try 60/40 in my favor, and we can see if that works for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give Bob a 20-point advantage, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Let's try 55/45 and see if you're willing to accept it""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly smaller advantage, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
