Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's find a middle ground already! 
# Bob gain: 437500 
# Alice gain: 562500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to make it seem like she's compromising, this offer is barely better than her last one.  The impact of inflation is becoming more significant with each round.  It's time to hold firm and see if we can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical.  We're past the halfway point, and this offer is more than fair considering the inflation. Take the deal now before it's worth even less for you.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I am slightly lowering my ask from Round 4 to show willingness to negotiate, but it's still a better deal than what Alice has offered. 
* **Inflation Pressure:** Emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation puts pressure on Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, we're entering a critical phase where we need to reach an agreement soon."
