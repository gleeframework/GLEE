"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\nI am offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself, with the reasoning that 60-40 seems like a relatively fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering I'm taking the risk of this offer being rejected. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer of a 55-45 split. Considering the money is worth 10% less in this round, I'm willing to take the risk of making a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, 58-42 is a more reasonable split now.""}\n\nGiven that the money is now worth 10% less than in the first round, and 1% less than in the second round, I'm adjusting my offer to a 58-42 split, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I believe this is a more reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way as well. Let's see how Bob responds!"
