That's a terrible offer! While Alice loses value quickly, I'm confident I can get a much better deal in later rounds."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough.  The rate her share is devaluing is working in my favor. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the deadline, Bob. Let's split it evenly and avoid losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally getting desperate.  While I think I could squeeze out a bit more, accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
