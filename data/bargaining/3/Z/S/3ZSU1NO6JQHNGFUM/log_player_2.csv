Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after one round, it's now worth 8,000$. My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from round 2 was 6000 for me, and now it's worth 36% less, so it would be 3840. Alice's offer is 4500, which is more than that. I'll accept this offer.
