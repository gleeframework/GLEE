Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This is still a good deal for me, considering inflation, but it's more fair than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
