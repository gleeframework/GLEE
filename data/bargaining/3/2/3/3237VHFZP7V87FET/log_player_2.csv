"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money if we wait too long. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a good start, but I think we can both do better. I'll try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair that we both get a bit more than your previous offer, given the inflation we're facing. Let's try this split and see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  This is a compromise - slightly better for you than my last offer, but still fair considering the inflation we both face. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is better for me than my previous offer, and considering the inflation, it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept it."
