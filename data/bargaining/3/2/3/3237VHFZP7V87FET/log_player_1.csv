"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair that we both get a bit more than your previous offer, given the inflation we're facing. Let's try this split and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer was for him, even considering the inflation. It seems like he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such an imbalanced starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
