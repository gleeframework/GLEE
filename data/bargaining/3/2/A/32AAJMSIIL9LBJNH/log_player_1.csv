"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, Alice. I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

Considering the money is worth 20% less now, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is taking a larger share, I'll have to decide whether it's worth accepting or not.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make a new offer. Considering the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced this time, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll take the lion's share now. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the money is worth only 48.8% of its original value, I'll think carefully about this offer. However, taking only $100,000 is not a very appealing option, especially since I'll have to live with the knowledge that I could have gotten a better deal earlier.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I'm running out of time. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. I'm taking a risk here, but I need a better deal.""
}
```

This is a more aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a decent amount of money now rather than waiting for a potentially worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'm taking most of what's left. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting!

Considering the money is worth only 6.72% of its original value, I'm facing a tough decision. $50,000 is a very small amount, but I'll have to think carefully about whether it's better than risking going home with nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, hoping to get a slightly better deal in the next round. It's getting increasingly unlikely that I'll get a decent amount of money, but I'll keep trying."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I'm running out of time. I'll try to make a last-ditch effort to get a decent deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering a 30-70 split, which is as generous as I can afford to be at this point. It's a risk, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a decent amount of money now rather than waiting for a potentially worse deal later."
