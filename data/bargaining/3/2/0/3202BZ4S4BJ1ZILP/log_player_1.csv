"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly.

The initial offer was $5000, and 20% of that is $1000, so my gain would be $4000 (5000 - 1000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have $4000, which is less than what I would have gotten in the first round, but I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, my gain will be worth 40% less than the initial $5000.

I'll propose a slightly smaller gain for myself to account for the inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""Take the majority, I'll take what's left""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
