"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping we can negotiate a better deal in future rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 20% gain I'd get, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
