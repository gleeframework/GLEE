# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering the drastic reduction in the value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While Bob's offer is still quite one-sided, I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get under these circumstances.
