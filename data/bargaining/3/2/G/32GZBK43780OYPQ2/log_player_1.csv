  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a positive note!"

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to keep a bit more for himself, huh?

I'll have to think about it...
