"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 7:3, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I don't think 7:3 is a fair compromise, considering I'm already down 40% from my initial offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer!

Considering the 10% decrease in value, I'll aim for a slightly more even split. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, 55-45?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55-45, a slight adjustment 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get closer to my original offer. I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 55-45 split, but I'll consider it.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually identical to my original offer in Round 3, which I rejected. I'm not sure if Bob is serious about this offer or just trying to get me to accept a stalemate.

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will come back with a more creative proposal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another move!

Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger share, 52-48""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to give me a bit more!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet at 50-50, a fair split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me halfway now. A 50-50 split is a reasonable proposal, especially considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise and we can finally conclude the game.
