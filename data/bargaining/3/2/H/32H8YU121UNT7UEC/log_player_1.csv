"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, especially since the money is already worth 10% less due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still reflects my desire to get a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to give you a good deal, but not as generous as before. You can do better! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is mounting!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially considering the significant inflation that has reduced the value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle. No more, no less.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair considering the significant inflation that has reduced the value of the money."
