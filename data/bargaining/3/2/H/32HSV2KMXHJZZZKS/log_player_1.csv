I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the first to propose. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split in Bob's favor. Since we're both losing money due to inflation, I think it's important to offer something closer to a 50/50 split to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not ideal, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is getting out of hand, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
