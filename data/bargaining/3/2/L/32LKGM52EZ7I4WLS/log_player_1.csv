"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts I'm considering are:

Alice gain: 8000 * 0.8 = 6400
Bob gain: 2000

Comparing this to Bob's offer:

Alice gain: 6000
Bob gain: 4000

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting less than I would have gotten in the previous round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a good deal, Bob. I'd rather wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a better share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your proposal, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, and then another 24.8% less after the second round, the actual amounts I'm considering are:

Alice gain: 8000 * 0.8 * 0.768 = 4915.2
Bob gain: 2000

Comparing this to Bob's offer:

Alice gain: 5000
Bob gain: 5000

I'll accept this offer since I'm getting more than I would have gotten in the previous round, and it's a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've convinced me. Let's split it 50-50.""
}
```"
