Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer is a bit aggressive, but it gives me a good starting point for negotiations. I believe there's a good chance Bob will want to accept this deal rather than risk getting less in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is proposing the exact opposite of my offer, which is completely unreasonable. I'll reject this and try to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a more fair and balanced offer. I hope Bob will see that we both have a better chance of getting a significant share of the money if we compromise."
