"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will take the easy way out and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like we're meeting in the middle, and I'll get $600,000, which is a decent split considering the inflation."
