"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45, with a message encouraging him to accept and end the game quickly to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for any more rounds! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 47.5,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""
}
```

I've taken into account the previous offers and tried to find a middle ground, while also considering that the money is worth a bit less due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see the reason in my proposal and accept it."
