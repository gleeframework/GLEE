Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split, acknowledging the risk of inflation but also valuing a fair distribution. Let's aim for 5500 for me and 4500 for you. We can finish this now and avoid further risk. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
