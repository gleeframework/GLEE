"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but still a bit too much in your favor.  I'm proposing 52/48. This split acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us while still being advantageous for me considering I proposed first. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical decision for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. Accepting a less favorable deal now is better than risking a worse outcome later.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is experiencing a 5% inflation rate and is unlikely to accept an offer where he receives less than 47.5% of the initial amount.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation only benefits Alice. Delaying a decision means Bob loses more value due to the higher inflation rate he faces.

By accepting the 52/48 split, Bob secures a reasonable portion of the money, even if it's slightly less than what he aimed for initially."
