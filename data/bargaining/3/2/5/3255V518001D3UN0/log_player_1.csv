"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'll be losing more value each round. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60-40 split is fair, considering I'm the one who made the initial offer. I was willing to give Bob a fair share, and now he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a better split. You'll still get a decent share, and I'll get a slightly better deal considering the inflation.""}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly better deal, but still trying to get a better share for myself."
