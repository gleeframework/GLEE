"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This way, we both get 50% of the initial amount, and we can call it a day."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me $400,000, which is worth 20% less than the initial $500,000, I'm essentially getting $400,000 / 0.8 = $500,000 in today's money. That's a decent offer, but I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80%), I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the inflation. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite!

Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer in today's money. For me, $450,000 is worth $450,000 / 0.5192 = $868,411. 

This is a decent offer, but I can still do better. I'll reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 61.92% of its original value now (80% of 77.64%). I'll aim for an even higher percentage to account for the inflation. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get an even larger share to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a big bite!

Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer in today's money. For me, $580,000 is worth $580,000 / 0.323 = $1,797,846.

This is a very good offer, and I'm starting to get worried that I might not get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
