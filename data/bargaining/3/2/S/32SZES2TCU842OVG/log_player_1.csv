"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000. This seems fair, but I'm also trying to account for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I am losing a lot more money, I am accepting the offer. If I reject it, Bob will get to make another offer and I risk ending up with nothing."
