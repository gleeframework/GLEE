"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $2000 is worth only $1800 in real terms, while Bob's gain of $8000 is worth $6400 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a big difference. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I'd like to propose a slightly more even split this round.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round, but I'd like to keep a bit more for myself. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $3000 is worth only $2171 in real terms, while Bob's gain of $7000 is worth $3640 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're right, I was getting stingier. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like to propose a slightly more even split this round.""

```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to find a more balanced compromise."
