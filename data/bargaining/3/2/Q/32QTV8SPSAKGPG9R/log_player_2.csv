# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob

# Alice gain: 60

# Alice gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing hardball, but I need to hold my nerve a bit longer.  Accepting $37 now would be a significant loss. There's still time for her to make a more reasonable offer, or for me to propose something slightly better that she might accept to avoid risking everything."

**Reasoning:** The situation is getting critical, but I can't accept such a low amount.  Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but with only a few rounds left, she faces the risk of getting nothing too. Holding on a little longer might force her to make a more reasonable offer."
