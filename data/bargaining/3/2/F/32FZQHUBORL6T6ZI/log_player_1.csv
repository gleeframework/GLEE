I'll propose that I take $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  This seems like a good starting point, as it gives me a significant advantage, but still leaves something for Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very unfair offer, and I'm not going to accept it. I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  This seems like the fairest solution, and hopefully, Bob will be more reasonable this time."
