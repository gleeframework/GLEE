I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round, hoping to secure a majority of the money while the inflation rate hasn't kicked in yet.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd like to have more, with inflation already kicking in, I think a 50/50 split is the best I can hope for. Let's end this quickly!"
