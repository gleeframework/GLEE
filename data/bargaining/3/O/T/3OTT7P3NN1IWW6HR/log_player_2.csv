"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Let's see how this plays out! I'm looking for a better deal than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe this is a fairer split, considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's reach a deal in this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both lose if this drags on. This offer is my last compromise. It accounts for the declining value but ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is reasonable, considering the declining value of the money. Accepting will ensure I receive a significant portion while avoiding further devaluation."
