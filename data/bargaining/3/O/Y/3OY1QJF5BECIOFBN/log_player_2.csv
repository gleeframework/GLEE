Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some willingness to compromise, the deal is still not favorable to me, especially with inflation eating into my potential gains. I need to push for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is barely budging while inflation is steadily eroding my potential gains. Accepting this offer would be a very bad deal considering the circumstances. I need to hold firm and hope Alice realizes that a fairer deal is in her best interest too."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. We're both losing money with each round.  This offer is fair and avoids further losses from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being stubborn, but I still think I can get a better deal 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** It's painful to accept this offer, but with each round, the situation is getting worse for me.  Alice is being stubborn, and the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. Taking this offer now is better than risking an even worse outcome in later rounds, where I might be forced to accept an even smaller share."
