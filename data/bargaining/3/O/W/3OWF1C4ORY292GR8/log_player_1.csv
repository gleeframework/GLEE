"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600 in real terms, while Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 6000 * 0.8 = 4800.

This offer is not as favorable to me as the previous one, but it's still a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.
