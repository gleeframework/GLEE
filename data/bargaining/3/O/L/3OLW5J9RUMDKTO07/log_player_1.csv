``` 

This is a tough situation. While I want to maximize my gains, the inflation is severely hurting my position. 

Bob is clearly taking advantage of the situation and is unlikely to accept anything close to an even split. If I continue to reject, I risk getting even less in future rounds as the value of the money decreases for me. 

Therefore, I'll grudgingly accept his offer of $4600. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
