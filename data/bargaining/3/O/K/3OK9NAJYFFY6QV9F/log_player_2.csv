Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, Alice is right about the time pressure.  Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable gain before inflation further eats into the potential winnings.
