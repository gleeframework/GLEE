"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Take it before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""The inflation is working against me. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and inflation is eating into your share. Accept this and cut your losses 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor to her advantage.  While my potential gains are decreasing, I need to hold firm to get a reasonable split. Accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is not a good strategy, even with the time pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, but I'm not desperate yet. This is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here. Inflation is killing your share, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While this offer is far from ideal, I'm starting to run out of time. Accepting 40, even with the 26.49% inflation hit, is better than risking getting nothing if Alice refuses to negotiate fairly in the remaining rounds.  It's a bitter pill, but better to secure something than risk everything on a potentially worse outcome."
