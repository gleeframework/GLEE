Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time.  Inflation is hitting us both, so it's time to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nA 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but considering the inflation affects me more, I think I can still push for a slightly better deal. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation difference, I think 58% for me is a reasonable adjustment. Let's close the deal before it's too late.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go up to 45% for you, but we need to close this soon.  The longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, accepting 45% seems like the best option. Further rounds will only decrease the value of the money, and I'm not confident I can negotiate a significantly better deal. It's time to close the deal."
