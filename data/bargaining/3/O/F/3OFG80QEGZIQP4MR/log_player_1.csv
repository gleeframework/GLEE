"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose taking $90 for myself and giving $10 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will favor Bob in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me $50 and avoids the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
