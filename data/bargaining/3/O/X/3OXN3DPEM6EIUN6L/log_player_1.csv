I'm going for a large share to start, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better, but it's still not fair. I want to get closer to a 50/50 split. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 78 
# Bob gain: 22

Even though the money is worth less now, I'm getting a decent share. It's better than risking getting nothing."
