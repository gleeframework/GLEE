"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose we split the money 5500 for me and 4500 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
This is a good deal for me. While the money is worth less due to inflation, I still get a good amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing if we don't agree."
