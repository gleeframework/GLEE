"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll want to negotiate and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the initial offer and get a much larger share of the money. I'll wait for a better offer from him."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was quite generous, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last round, I'm taking a bit more this time. Your turn!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will try to negotiate further or accept this offer."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob is still trying to get a better deal, and I'm not willing to accept a split that's so close to 50/50. I'll wait for a more generous offer from him."

Round 5

  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and inflation isn't helping. You'd better make a better offer next time!""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""alice_gain"": 480000,

  ""message"": ""This is my last offer. Take it or leave it. I'm not going to negotiate further.""

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to cut my losses and accept a deal that's not ideal, but still better than going to another round. The inflation is taking a huge toll, and I don't want to risk losing even more value."
