"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself. You can accept or reject.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm not giving away too much in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'll take half, and you can have the other half. We both get a good deal, and we don't have to waste any more time with this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I should accept Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd be getting only 80% of $5,000, which is $4,000. Meanwhile, Bob would be getting the full $5,000, which is more than he would have gotten in the first round. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. It's a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
