"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming to secure a deal quickly. I'm confident Bob will accept this, especially considering the potential for inflation to drastically reduce the value of the money in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is way too unfair to me, even taking into account the inflation.  I'm going to counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still offering a significant portion to Bob. Since he rejected my initial offer, I need to show I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrate that I value my share.  Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to him in light of the ongoing inflation."
