"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself. I'm assuming Bob will be happy with 10% given the circumstances, but I'm willing to negotiate in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my first proposal, it's still not a good deal for me.  The inflation has made my share worth 20% less, and 200,000 is not a fair amount considering the starting sum. I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway.  I'm lowering my share to 600,000, which is still more than double what he offered me, but hopefully, it's a reasonable compromise.  Inflation is biting, so I need to secure a decent amount this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Inflation has taken a huge toll on my earnings. I'm now earning significantly less than what I initially proposed.  While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's the best I can get at this point.  Accepting it guarantees me some money, and with the current inflation rate, it's unlikely I can secure a better deal in the future."
