"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game strategy - I offer Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll take it rather than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to get half the money than risk getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
