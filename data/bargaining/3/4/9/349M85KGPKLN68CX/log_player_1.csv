# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further losses.
