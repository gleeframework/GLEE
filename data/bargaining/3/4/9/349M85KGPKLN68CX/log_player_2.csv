"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm feeling a bit greedy. Even though it's a ""fair"" split, I know that the money will be worth less in the next round, and Alice's offer favors her more. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a more equitable starting point. We can adjust from here if you're not satisfied.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle or we'll keep negotiating. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. Even though I'm losing money, I'm not going to settle for a deal that's so unfavorable. I'm going to stick to my guns and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, given the inflation we're both facing. We can avoid further losses if we agree now.""}
