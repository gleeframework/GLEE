Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I'm proposing a slightly better split for me this time.  Let's wrap this up quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 6400,
""bob_gain"": 3600,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to a fair split.  We both know this makes the most sense. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Alice. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the decreasing value of the money means Bob is getting a much worse deal with each passing round. Alice can likely leverage this to secure a better deal in the following rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6700,

""message"": ""Bob, time is running out, and the money is losing value fast. This offer is still decent for you, but we need to decide now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a small hit to end this.  Agree now, and we both win. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this offer is better than Bob's previous offer and is starting to get close to a point where it might be more advantageous for Alice to take the deal. 

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is on both players. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if Alice pushes for a slightly better split in the next round or two, the inflation will continue to eat into the overall value. It might not be worth risking getting nothing at all."
