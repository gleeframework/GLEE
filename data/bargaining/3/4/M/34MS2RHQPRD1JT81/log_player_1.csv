"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, and Bob's offer is still 60%, I'll have to calculate the actual amount I'll get.

40% of the original $100 is $40, but due to 20% inflation, that's equivalent to $32 in this round.

Similarly, Bob's 60% is equivalent to $60 in this round, but due to 5% inflation, that's equivalent to $57.

I'll accept Bob's offer for $57.
