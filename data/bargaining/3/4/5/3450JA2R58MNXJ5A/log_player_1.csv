I'm going to start with a very simple proposal, giving Bob a tiny portion of the money to encourage him to accept and avoid the potential losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
