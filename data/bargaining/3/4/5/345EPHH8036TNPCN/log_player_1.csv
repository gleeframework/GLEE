I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob.  This will hopefully encourage him to accept in the first round, minimizing the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being incredibly greedy!  Even with the inflation, his offer is absurdly unfair. I'm not going to accept this. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable offer considering the current inflation.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to compromise."
