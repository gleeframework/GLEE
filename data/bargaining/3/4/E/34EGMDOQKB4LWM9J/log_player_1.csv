"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Let's start fair, I take the majority, but you get a small share.  Accept and we're done.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away the majority just yet. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""This inflation is getting serious!  Let's meet in the middle this time.  I'll take a smaller share, but we can both get something decent.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm still willing to give you something. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the money I gain is significantly less due to inflation, at this point, it's better to accept and get something rather than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
