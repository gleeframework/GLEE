"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  It's still more than you'd get if we keep rejecting each other. Let's be smart and end this. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The threat of her ""final offer"" doesn't hold much weight this early in the game. We have time to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a fair deal that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us. This offer is a compromise."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money with every round.  Let's meet in the middle.  This offer is fair, given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, this offer is the closest we've gotten to an even split.  Given the increasing inflation, accepting this offer is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
