"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I figure Bob might be surprised and accept, especially in the first round. If he doesn't, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and it's better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
