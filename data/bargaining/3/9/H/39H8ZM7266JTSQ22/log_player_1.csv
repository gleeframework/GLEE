"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair and simple split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. I think this is a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, but I'm not giving you the better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the new offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I'm hoping to do better next time!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to balance the scales""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more skewed towards Bob this time. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time for a 50/50 split, Alice! No more games. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting lower due to inflation, but Bob's message is getting more serious!

I think Bob's proposal for a 50/50 split is a good one, considering the reduced value of the money. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game.
