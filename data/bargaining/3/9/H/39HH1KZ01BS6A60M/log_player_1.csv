"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can negotiate further if you want""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%. I'm being generous, but I'm also trying to get a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I offered Bob $2,000, which was 20% of the initial $10,000. Now, with inflation, that's equivalent to 19% of the current $9,950 (since $2,000 is worth 95% of its original value).

Bob's offer is now $6,000, which is 60% of the current $10,000. That's a significant increase from my original offer, and I'm not sure if I want to push for more.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now.
