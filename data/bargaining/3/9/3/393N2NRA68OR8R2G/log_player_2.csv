"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round. I might be able to get a better deal if I reject her initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair compromise. Let's end this quickly and avoid further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly.  Further rounds will only hurt both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option here. Further rounds will significantly reduce the value of the money for both of us due to inflation. It's better to take the guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting less in the next round."
