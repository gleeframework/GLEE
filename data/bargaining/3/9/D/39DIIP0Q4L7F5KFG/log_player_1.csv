"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A more reasonable offer from Bob!

I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer, since I can do better than a 50-50 split. I'll try to get more money for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
