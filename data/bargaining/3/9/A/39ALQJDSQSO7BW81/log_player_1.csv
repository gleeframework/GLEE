"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, you can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, and warning Bob that he won't get a better offer from me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than this. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself by offering a slightly smaller share, but still a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not generous enough! 
# Alice gain: 538000 
# Bob gain: 462000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because the difference between the two options is relatively small, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting a worse deal due to further inflation."
