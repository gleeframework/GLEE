"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation rate. This ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While it's a decent starting point, I'm not happy with the 50/50 split considering Alice is getting a 5% inflation discount. Let's see what she offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Since inflation affects us differently, I propose a split that favors me slightly.  This way we both get a good share, and we can end this game quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this settled. Let's end this with a perfectly fair 50/50 split.  Every round costs us!  
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, with the inflation rate hurting me more each round, a 50/50 split is the most reasonable way to end this.  Let's just get this done!"
