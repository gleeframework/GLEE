"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll have to decide. I'll...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and considering Bob's aggressive offer in the previous round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but still trying to be reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll! My gain of $3000 is now worth 29.4% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $7000 is worth 56% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the offers I've seen so far, this one seems quite skewed in Bob's favor. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept this offer. Now it's his turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll! My gain of $1500 is now worth 15.1% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $8500 is worth 56.25% of what it was in the first round.

This offer is extremely unfavorable to me, and I'm starting to think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a huge share of the money. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Since I'm not sure how much longer the money will be worth, I'll try to take a bigger share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not sure if he'll be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. My gain of $1000 is now worth 10% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $9000 is worth 45.5% of what it was in the first round.

This offer is extremely unfavorable to me, and I'm starting to think Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation to get almost all the money. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth almost 60% of its original value due to inflation, I'll try to make a final push for a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering a relatively small share to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll see that I'm making a serious effort to compromise and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has taken a huge toll on the value of the money. My gain of $500 is now worth 5% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $9500 is worth 38.75% of what it was in the first round.

This offer is completely unacceptable to me. I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me such a tiny fraction of the original amount. I'll have to reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth only 38.75% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a final, desperate attempt to get a decent share. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900,
  ""bob_gain"": 9100
}
```

I'm offering Bob almost all of the remaining money, but I'm hoping he'll see that I'm making a last-ditch effort to compromise and will accept this offer."
