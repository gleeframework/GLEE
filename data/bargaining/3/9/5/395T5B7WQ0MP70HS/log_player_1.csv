I'm going to propose a 900,000/100,000 split.  It seems fair to me, given the risk of inflation and the fact that I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 600,000/400,000 split.  While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm confident that this offer is still fair, given that I'm taking the risk of Bob rejecting it and the possibility of a smaller split in the next round."
