"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 100,000 dollars is a lot of money, it's worth taking a chance to see if Alice will offer more in the next round.  I don't know how the inflation affects her, but I know it affects me, so I need to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this offer is a significant improvement over the previous round. With the inflation, my gain is effectively 90.25% of the original value. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to ensure a good amount of money."
