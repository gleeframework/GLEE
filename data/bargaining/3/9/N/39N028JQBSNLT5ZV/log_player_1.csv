I propose to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000.  Let's see if he thinks that's fair!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept this offer. Even with the inflation, 5000 dollars is better than 9000 dollars worth 5% less."
