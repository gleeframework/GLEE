"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this relatively generous offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken a bite out of my potential earnings.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite satisfied with the 60-40 split. I think I can do better, especially considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on 70-30, but I'm not budging much""
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming to keep the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50-50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I don't want to risk waiting for another offer and potentially getting less. Considering the significant impact of inflation, I think this is a decent compromise.

I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's call it a day and split the remaining $10,000 50-50."
