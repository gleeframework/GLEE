Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 60

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me with each round. Waiting any longer will result in an even smaller share, even if I manage to secure a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Bob's Strategy:**  Bob is clearly aware of the inflation and is using it to his advantage. He's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this in subsequent rounds.
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer ends the game and guarantees me a portion of the money. Rejecting it risks walking away with nothing if we can't reach an agreement. 

It's a tough decision, but the impact of inflation makes accepting this offer the least risky option at this stage."
