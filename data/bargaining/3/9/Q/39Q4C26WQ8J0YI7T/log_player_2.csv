"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can always adjust later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While it might seem tempting to accept something rather than risk getting nothing, the significant difference in inflation rates gives me a strong bargaining position.  Alice's share will devalue much faster than mine in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was quite lopsided. Let's be more realistic. Considering the inflation rates, this offer secures a fair deal for both of us in the long run.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference.  60/40 in my favor is reasonable given the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still heavily favoring herself, even with her understanding of the inflation. While 400,000 is a significant sum, accepting this offer sets a bad precedent and she may not budge much in future rounds.  I need to show I'm serious about a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer reflects the time pressure and inflation while still giving us both a reasonable share.""
