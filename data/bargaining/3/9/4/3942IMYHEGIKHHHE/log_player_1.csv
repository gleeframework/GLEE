"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0}

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets nothing. This is a pretty aggressive offer, but it's a good starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll on Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer that's more reasonable this time. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. This seems like a fair split, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger hit on Bob's offer this time. I'll have to think about whether this is a good opportunity.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
