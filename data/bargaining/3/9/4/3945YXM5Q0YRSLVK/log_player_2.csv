"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 50-50, I'll try to get a better deal. Given the inflation effect, I'll propose a slightly biased offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still a 52-48 split, which is closer to 50-50 than my previous offer. Considering the inflation, I'll take this offer.
