"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more fair starting point.  Let's work from there. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'd rather get more now. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $4,000 and Bob will take $6,000."
