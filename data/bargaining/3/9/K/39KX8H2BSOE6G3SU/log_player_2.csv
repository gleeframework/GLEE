"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, 90% for me and 10% for you. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 10% cut.  I'll see what I can do with a proposal of my own.  Let's see what happens next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable here. I'm offering you a fair 40%, which is still more than you'd get if we keep rejecting each other.  Think about it, each round we lose 20% of the pot!""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not happy with 40% after our initial deal. This time, let's go 50/50. We've both lost money already, so let's end this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and we've already lost a lot of money. It's time to end this game before we lose any more."
