Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable here. I'm offering you a fair 40%, which is still more than you'd get if we keep rejecting each other.  Think about it, each round we lose 20% of the pot! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
