"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation rate works heavily in my favor.  Alice's share loses value much faster than mine. By rejecting and moving to the next round, I increase my potential share without taking too much of a hit from inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair split, but inflation hurts you more than me. This offer gives you a good deal considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Inflation:** I'm using the inflation difference to my advantage. Alice's share loses value quickly, so she's incentivized to accept a slightly lower offer now rather than risk getting even less later.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** I'm acknowledging her desire for fairness while explaining why my offer makes sense given the game's rules. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm starting with an offer slightly in my favor, anticipating potential counter-offers in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right about inflation, but I still think we can find a better balance 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but her offer is still not favorable enough. While she's acknowledging the inflation impact, the difference in our potential losses means I have more leverage to push for a better deal.  Each round that passes gives me a stronger negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, and every round costs us both. This is my final offer, and it accounts for the rapid decrease in your share's value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  The rounds are progressing, and the shrinking pot is a real concern. It's time to apply pressure and make Alice realize a deal needs to be made.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling I'm unwilling to budge much in future rounds.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm willing to concede slightly from my previous offer, showing some flexibility while still maintaining an advantageous position.
* **Focus on Her Loss:** I'm emphasizing the rapid devaluation of her share, making my offer seem more appealing compared to the risk of continued delay."
