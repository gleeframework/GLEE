"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to consider that in my decision. With that in mind, I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, as it's even more skewed towards Bob's favor.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45/55 is a fairer split""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm the one who's been generous so far! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

Considering the drastic reduction in my gains, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm also aware that I've been rejecting Bob's offers and I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even worse deal.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to negotiate further in the next round.
