# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation and the significant reduction in my share from the first round, I find Bob's offer unsatisfactory. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This offer is my final compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and Bob's message indicating this is his final compromise, I find the offer of $3500 for myself and $6500 for Bob to be the best deal I can get under the circumstances. I'll accept this offer to secure some value before it devalues further."
