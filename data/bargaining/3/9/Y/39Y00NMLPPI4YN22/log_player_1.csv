"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$ and keeping 80% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to be fair 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less than the original 100$, it's equivalent to 90% of the original amount. So, Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: 60 (as stated)
* Bob gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36

I'll accept Bob's offer, since it's a fair split.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
