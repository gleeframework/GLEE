"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, which is a 90-10 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $450,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the split, but it's a fair offer. I'll accept.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
