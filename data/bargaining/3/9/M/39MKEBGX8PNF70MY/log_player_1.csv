"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2.

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```
I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share for myself and keeping the game going."
