"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Accept this and we can end the game early! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Don't be greedy, accept this and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but I'm still trying to be generous to get him to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle and we can finalize the deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share! I need to think carefully about this offer. Meeting in the middle sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

After considering the inflation, I think I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking even lower gains.
