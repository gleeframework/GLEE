"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount of money and avoid the risk of inflation reducing the value of the money over the next 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I'll need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not give Bob a 60% share, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I'm getting a bit desperate. I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than waiting for a better offer and risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
