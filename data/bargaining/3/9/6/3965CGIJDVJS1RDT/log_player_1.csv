"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'll think carefully... If I accept this offer, I'll get $6,000, which is worth 10% less than my initial offer of $8,000. But it's better than nothing, and it's a more reasonable offer than the first one.
