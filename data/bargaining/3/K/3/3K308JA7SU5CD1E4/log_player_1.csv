"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. It's better for both of us to agree now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
