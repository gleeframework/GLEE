"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I think this is a good way to split the money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI think I can get a better deal than that! I'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. Besides, 45 is less than half, and I think we should start with a more even split. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's start fresh with a fair 50-50 split!""}\n\n###\nI'm hoping Alice will see the sense in an equal split, especially since we're still in the early rounds and the money hasn't devalued much yet. Fingers crossed!"
