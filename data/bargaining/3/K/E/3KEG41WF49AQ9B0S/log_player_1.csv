"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, leaving us both with $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 420,000, leaving Bob with 580,000. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give up too much more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the money is worth less and less, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

I'm increasing my share slightly, to 360,000, leaving Bob with 640,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him!"
