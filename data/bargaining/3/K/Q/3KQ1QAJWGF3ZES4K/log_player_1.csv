Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a better starting point. It's still fair, but gives me a slight edge to reflect the risk of continuing. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up my negotiating power just yet. I think I can do better than 55-45. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.
