"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money fairly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we can both walk away with a decent amount if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time. Will you accept? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not too thrilled about the new offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob such a large share, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing for him. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. It's a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant amount for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we're getting closer to a fair split."
