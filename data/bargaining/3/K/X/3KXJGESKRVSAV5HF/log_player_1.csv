"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message encouraging him to accept this initial offer as a fair starting point."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more even split. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need to make sure I get a decent return as well. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I've taken into account the inflation and reduced my initial offer, but I'm still trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand inflation is affecting both of us. But let's be realistic. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with less. This offer gives you a good share, and it ensures we both get something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns, but I think we can still find a better balance. Inflation is hitting me harder, after all""
}
```

I'm still trying to find a compromise, but I'm also aware that the inflation is affecting me more than Bob, so I'm trying to adjust the offer accordingly."
