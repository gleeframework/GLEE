"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, Bob knows that the money will be worth less to Alice in subsequent rounds, making it more likely she'll accept a less favorable deal later.  He can likely get a better split for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need to make sure I get a decent return as well.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should reject this offer. While it's a slight improvement over Alice's initial offer, it still doesn't account for the significant inflation impacting Alice's earnings.  Bob can likely push for a more favorable split in the next round, knowing that Alice's share will continue to devalue."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I understand inflation is affecting both of us. But let's be realistic. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with less. This offer gives you a good share, and it ensures we both get something substantial.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I think we can still find a better balance. Inflation is hitting me harder, after all 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob should accept this offer. While the inflation has drastically reduced the value of Alice's share, she is offering a better deal than Bob's previous offer, which was rejected.  Furthermore, with each passing round, Alice's share will devalue even further, potentially leading to a less favorable outcome for Bob.  Accepting this offer guarantees a decent share for Bob, and it's unlikely Alice will offer more in the following rounds."
