"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%.  This way we both get something and have a chance to negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob and I'm going to try to get a better deal than 10%.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the value of the money decreases for me each round. Let's be reasonable and work towards a solution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the value of the money decreases for you each round, Bob.  Let's compromise.  I'll take 60% and leave you with 40%.  This is a significant increase from your previous offer, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm happy to accept this offer.  While I would have preferred a larger share,  it's a significant improvement over the last offer and keeps us both from losing everything due to inflation."
