"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, I'll take the majority, but it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual value I'll gain, not the nominal amount.

My gain would be 3000, which is 60% of the current value of the money. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but it's a better offer than the previous one.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the inflation, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you'll have to make a better offer if you want more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting tougher.

Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth about 43.4% of the original $10,000. It's a lower share than before, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll think carefully before making a decision...
