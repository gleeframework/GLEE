"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, I want to secure the majority of the money early on.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer and given that the money is worth less to Bob with each round, it's likely he won't make a better offer in the future."
