**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is heavily impacting her potential gains. While her offer is better than her Round 3 offer, I'm holding out for a slightly better deal.  There's still time, and the pressure is on her."

The tide is turning. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer now guarantees a reasonable gain before inflation eats further into her share, making a potentially worse deal for me in the later rounds."
