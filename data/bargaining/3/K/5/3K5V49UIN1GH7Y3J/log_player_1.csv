"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3800 in real terms (95% of $4000). Not bad, but I'm not sure I'm ready to settle for this amount just yet.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
