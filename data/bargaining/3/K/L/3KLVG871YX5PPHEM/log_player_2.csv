Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. We're both losing money with each round, so it's in both our interests to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Bob) with each passing round. Accepting $350,000 now might seem okay, but it's significantly less than what it was worth in the first round due to inflation. 

I need to push for a better deal in the next round, even if it means risking a lower offer from Alice later."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a little frustrated, Bob. We're both losing money here.  This is my final offer - let's settle before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and Alice's patience is wearing thin. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than nothing, which is what we both risk getting if we don't agree soon. Accepting $400,000 now, even with the significant inflation, is better than walking away empty-handed."
