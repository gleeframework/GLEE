"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $6000 and leave $4000 for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair split. The total amount of money is still worth $10,000 at this point, as it's the first round and no inflation has occurred yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  Let's split the money more evenly.  
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer, which means the game will proceed to the next round. Alice likely rejects the offer because she initially proposed a 60-40 split in her favor and Bob's counteroffer flips this ratio, giving him the larger share. Additionally, considering the inflation that reduces the value of her gain by 20% each round, Alice might be motivated to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money for her."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $5800 and leave $4200 for Bob, with a message suggesting they meet in the middle. Given the inflation, the actual value of Alice's gain would be 20% less than the nominal value for the second time, but she's trying to find a compromise that might be acceptable to Bob, considering his previous offer and her initial proposal."
