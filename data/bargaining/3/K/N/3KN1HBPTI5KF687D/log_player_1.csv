"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 30, I'll take 70. It's a fair start.""
}
```

This offer gives me a decent amount, but leaves Bob with something too, so he might consider it a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 split seems like a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so my potential gain is now 63 (70 * 0.9).

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. It's a fair and reasonable proposal, and I don't want to risk losing more money in subsequent rounds.
