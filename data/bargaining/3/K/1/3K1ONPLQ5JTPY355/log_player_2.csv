"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable to start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation impacts me, Bob, but your offer was too low. How about we flip the numbers from your previous offer? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the inflation, her offer still heavily favors her. It's important to remember that the longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts *her* position, not mine.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to go 52/48, acknowledging that you're feeling the inflation pressure. Time is running out for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** Moving closer to a 50/50 split shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes that time is working against Alice more than Bob. This might push her to accept a slightly less favorable deal rather than risk getting nothing. 
* **Balance:** It's still a better offer for Bob than anything Alice has proposed, but it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally caved to the pressure of the inflation. A 50/50 split is a fair deal, especially considering she's losing value with every passing round. It's time to accept and secure a good payout."
