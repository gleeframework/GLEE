"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a 90/10 split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very unfair offer. While Alice is losing value due to inflation, it makes much more sense to aim for a more equitable split. I'm willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. How about a 60/40 split? It's a good deal considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation, but I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the reduced value of my share due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. While her offer acknowledges the inflation, she's trying to get the better end of the deal.  I need to hold firm for a better split, even with the inflation working against her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  55/45 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
