"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose keeping the majority of the money for myself, as I am aware of the inflation and want to secure the highest possible value.  Let's see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation makes my share worth less, I'm better off accepting this offer than risking another round and potentially getting a worse deal."
