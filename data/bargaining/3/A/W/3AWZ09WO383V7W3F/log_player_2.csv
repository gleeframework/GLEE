# Alice gain: 58

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Close to even, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, it's important to consider the impact of inflation.  Alice is unlikely to offer a 50/50 split since she's not experiencing the devaluation.  I need to push for a better deal in the next few rounds while the value of my potential earnings is still significant."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm applying a bit of pressure here with a ""final offer"" while the amount I'm conceding is still relatively small due to inflation.  It's a gamble, but Alice might concede knowing that time is running out and future offers from me will likely be less favorable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not budging 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me! While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I can likely get in future rounds. Alice is clearly playing hardball and knows the impact of the inflation on my side. Accepting now cuts my losses."
