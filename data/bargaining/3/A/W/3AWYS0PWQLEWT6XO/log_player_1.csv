"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for myself. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we can split the money fairly without too much haggling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer carefully. Since the money I gain remains the same, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be closer to the previous round's offer, but still keeping a slight advantage for myself. My message is a bit more assertive, suggesting I'm not willing to give up too much ground."
