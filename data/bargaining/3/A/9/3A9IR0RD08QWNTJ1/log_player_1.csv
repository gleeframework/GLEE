"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, my effective gain in the second round is 0.95 x 400000 = 380000.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather get a higher share to compensate for the inflation. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob, while still keeping a slight edge due to the initial 60-40 split."
