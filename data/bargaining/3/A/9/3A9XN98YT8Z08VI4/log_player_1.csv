"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to try to get the majority of the money, but I'm also going to offer Bob something to ensure he doesn't immediately reject my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still trying to get the majority of the money, but I'm reducing my share a bit more since I'm aware of the inflation. Bob rejected my last offer, and I'm not sure if he'll accept this one, but it's worth a shot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share, it's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing in the next round. The value of the money I would gain in the next round would be even lower, and I'm not confident I could get a better deal from Bob."
