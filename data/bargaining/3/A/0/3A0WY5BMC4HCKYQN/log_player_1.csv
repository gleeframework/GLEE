"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, my gain of 300,000 is actually worth 250,000 in real value. Bob's gain of 700,000 is worth 630,000 in real value.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the money in this round.

Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, my gain of 400,000 is actually worth 208,320 in real value. Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 438,000 in real value.

Considering this, I'll decide to accept the offer.
