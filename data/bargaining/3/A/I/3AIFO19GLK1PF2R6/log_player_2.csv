# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to try to flip the script on Alice. Since she offered me 4000 in the first round, I'm going to offer her 4000 and keep 6000 for myself.  Let's see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Even though Alice has increased her offer slightly, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of my share.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm going to try to be more reasonable this time and offer Alice a slightly smaller share, but still a significant portion.  Let's see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. Even though inflation has hit my share pretty hard, a 50/50 split is fair considering the game is getting increasingly risky. I don't want to push my luck further and risk getting nothing at all."
