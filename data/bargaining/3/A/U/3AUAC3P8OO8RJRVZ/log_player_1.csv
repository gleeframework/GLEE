"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this round, my gain of 3000 is worth 80% of what it was in the previous round, so it's equivalent to 4800 in the first round's value. However, Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 9500 in the first round's value.

Given the significant difference in the equivalent values, I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less in each round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decreasing value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the equivalent values of Bob's offer in the first round's value.

My gain of 4500 in this round is worth 52.2% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 5220 in the first round's value. Bob's gain of 5500 is worth 86.74% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 8694 in the first round's value.

Given the relatively small difference in the equivalent values, I'll accept this offer.
