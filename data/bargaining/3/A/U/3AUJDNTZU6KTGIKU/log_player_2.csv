Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you more than your last offer to me, even though the inflation is hurting me worse.  Let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing about being reasonable.  While she's offering more than my last offer *to her*, she's still taking a much larger share than I am.  The inflation is indeed hitting her harder, making it less likely she'll risk getting $0 in the later rounds.  I need to hold firm and wait for a better offer."
