Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."

Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. I'd rather make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure about an even split, Bob. I'll make a new proposal. How about 6500 for me and 3500 for you?""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go back to the first round's split. This inflation is making things difficult, and I'd rather secure a decent amount than risk getting less later. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to go back to the original split, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. You're right, the inflation is making things tricky. I'll take the 6000 and you can have the 4000. Let's wrap it up.""}"
