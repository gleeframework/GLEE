```

  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'd get $40, which is still worth $40, and Bob would get $60, but it's worth $57.90 due to the 5% decrease in value.

I'm not convinced that I deserve to get only $40, so I'll reject this offer.

Round 3

Do you accept this offer?","Wait, I think there's a mistake in the inflation calculation. The money Bob gains is worth 5% less each round, not 14.26%. 

Assuming that's correct, Bob's offer is the same as the one he made in round 2, but the money is worth less due to inflation.

In this case, I'll reject the offer again, since it's the same as the previous one.
