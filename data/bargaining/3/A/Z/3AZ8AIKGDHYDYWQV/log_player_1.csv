"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. This is more balanced, and we should settle this quickly with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Your offer was tempting, but still not favorable for me in the long run.  This is my counter-offer. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains."" 
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm increasing my offer, but you need to compromise too. Let's be reasonable and end this before inflation hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 
It's getting risky to push further. Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than I am, and while this isn't the best deal, it's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting a worse deal later or even timing out."
