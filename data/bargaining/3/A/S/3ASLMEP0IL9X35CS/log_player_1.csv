"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to keep 90 dollars for myself, and give Bob 10 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage Bob will face in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to keep more, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation and limited rounds.  I'm taking the guaranteed 50 dollars."
