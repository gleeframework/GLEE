Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. I understand your position, but I need to look out for my own interests too. This offer is still generous considering the depreciation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
