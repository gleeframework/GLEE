"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. While not ideal, I'm willing to forgo some initial gains for a more equitable outcome in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""That's a tough start, Alice. How about we try something a little more balanced this time? This offer recognizes the time pressure we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about balance, Bob. Let's split the difference from the last round. This way, we both get something, and we can keep negotiating towards a more favorable outcome. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to frame this as a compromise, but it's a slow creep in her favor. The longer this goes on, the more the inflation disparity hurts me. I need to push for a better split soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  This offer is firm, and it's the most equitable path forward considering the inflation working against us both.""}"
