"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm hoping for a fair split, but I'm willing to take the larger share this round to get things started. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept such an unfair split. It's the first round, and I have nothing to lose by proceeding to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I believe this is a reasonable offer.""}\n\nSince Alice was willing to take the larger share in the first round, I'm assuming she's open to negotiations. Given the inflation rate, I'm taking a slightly higher share to account for the 20% decrease in value for me, while still offering Alice a significant amount. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a more even split is possible. Let's keep talking. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal than 40% of the original amount. Alice seems willing to compromise, so I'll try to push for a more favorable split in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need to account for the larger depreciation on my end.""}\n\nI'll try to find a middle ground that takes into account the growing difference in the value of the money due to inflation. Since Alice is willing to compromise, I'll offer her a bit more than before, while ensuring I don't lose out too much due to the 36% depreciation on my end. Fingers crossed!"
