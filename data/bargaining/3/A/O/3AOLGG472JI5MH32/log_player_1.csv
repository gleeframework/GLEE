"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, so I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start for me, but I'll try to do better next time.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I think I can do better than 40%.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This way, I get a slightly larger share, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get closer to the 60% share he wanted earlier.

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round.
