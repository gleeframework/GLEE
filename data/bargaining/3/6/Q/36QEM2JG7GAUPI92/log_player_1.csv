"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to take 9000 dollars and leave Bob with 1000 dollars. This is a generous offer, and I believe it is likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm proposing a 8000/2000 split.  Inflation is hitting hard, so I'm offering a bit less for myself while still giving Bob a decent share.  Let's see if this is acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I would gain by rejecting and making a counter-offer. It's better to secure 2000 dollars now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
