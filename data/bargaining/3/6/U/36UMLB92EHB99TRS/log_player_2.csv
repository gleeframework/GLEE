Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the decreasing value. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This is my final offer. It's a reasonable split considering the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. It's the best you'll get considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe.  While getting a larger share would be ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action for these reasons:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money for Bob is rapidly decreasing. Waiting longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Rejecting it likely means getting nothing at all.

It's a tough situation, but taking the $400,000 (though significantly devalued) is better than risking getting $0 by holding out for a better deal that might not come.
