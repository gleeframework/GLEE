Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm taking a larger share to offset the significant loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very greedy, but time is also running out.  We need to push our luck a little further to see if she'll become more reasonable.  It's risky, but potentially the best path to a better outcome than $38."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a larger risk for a larger share, rather than accepting an offer that doesn't compensate for the loss from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough call, but with only four rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing is very high.  Alice seems determined not to accept anything less than a large share, and waiting might force us to accept an even worse offer later.  $35 is better than nothing."
