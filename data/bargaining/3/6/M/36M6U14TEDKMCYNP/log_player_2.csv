Let's see how this plays out in future rounds. I'm willing to negotiate for a larger share, but I need to balance that against the risk of inflation."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial offer, but still heavily favors her. The impact of inflation is becoming more significant, but I'm willing to hold out for a better deal for a few more rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me less, I can afford to wait 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly playing hardball, but her offer is getting worse for me with each round due to the uneven inflation.  I need to push for a more significant change in the next round, or I risk being left with a very unfavorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome.  We both lose if we don't agree now.""}
