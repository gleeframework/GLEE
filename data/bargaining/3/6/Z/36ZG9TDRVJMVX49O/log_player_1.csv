"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but leaves Bob with a small share.  This is a risky move, as Bob might reject the offer and have a chance to propose a more favorable deal for himself in the next round. However, since Bob's money loses value faster than mine, he might be incentivized to accept a smaller share rather than risk losing even more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer gives me less money, it's still a significant amount. However, I'm confident that I can secure a better deal for myself in the next round. Bob's money is losing value faster than mine, so he'll likely be more willing to compromise to avoid further losses.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  Bob's money is worth 40% less than in the first round, so he should be motivated to take this offer. It's still a significant amount for him, and I'm willing to give up some of my potential gains to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
