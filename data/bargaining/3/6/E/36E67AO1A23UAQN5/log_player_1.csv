"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'm inclined to accept Bob's offer since I'm still getting a larger share of the money in real terms, even though it's less in nominal terms. I'll accept the offer.
