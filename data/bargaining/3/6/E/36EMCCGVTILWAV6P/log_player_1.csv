Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me a large share, but still leaves Bob with something. I want to see how he responds and whether he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than my initial proposal, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of my share. I'm going to reject this and see if I can negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference. Since the inflation is affecting my share more, I'm offering a slightly lower amount for myself, but still significantly more than Bob's last offer."
