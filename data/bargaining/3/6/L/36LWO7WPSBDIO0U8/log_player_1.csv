"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us receiving $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's take more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50% gain going to Bob, but I'll think carefully about it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much!""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep some balance in the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive again! I'm not thrilled about the 70% gain going to Bob, but I'll think carefully about it.

Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to make a compromise. I'll accept this offer, but only because I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't divide the money soon.
