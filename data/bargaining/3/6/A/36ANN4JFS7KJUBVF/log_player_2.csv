Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're pushing for a 60/40 split, but I'm not budging. I'll give you 55% and take 45%. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 450000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging on the 55% share I offered earlier. You're getting desperate, Bob. I'll give you 52% and take 48%. That's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While a 52% split isn't ideal, it's still a decent gain, and the inflation risk is mounting. Accepting this offer is the best option for me at this point."
