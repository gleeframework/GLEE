"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

This offer gives me the majority of the money ($990,000) and gives Bob a small amount ($10,000).  I'm hoping that since he's only getting a small amount, he'll be motivated to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep more, the money is losing value quickly. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount, and any further rounds risk losing more than half of my potential gains due to inflation."
