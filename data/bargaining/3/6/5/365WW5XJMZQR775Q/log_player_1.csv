"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal! This offer is in both our best interests considering the inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** Alice starts with a favorable but not outrageous offer. 70/30 gives her the lion's share while still offering Bob a substantial sum.
* **Inflation Factor:** Highlighting the inflation rate is crucial. It puts pressure on Bob to accept now, as the value of the money decreases significantly for both of them with each passing round. 
* **Urgency and Collaboration:**  The message aims to convey urgency while suggesting the offer is mutually beneficial. This avoids coming across as overly aggressive in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. This is more balanced considering the inflation will hurt me more. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is indeed more ""balanced"" in appearance, but it's crucial to look at the bigger picture. 

* **Relative Loss:** While Bob loses 20% per round to inflation, Alice only loses 10%. This means time is more on Alice's side. Accepting a 60/40 split now isn't significantly better than what Alice could aim for in the next round.
* **Negotiating Position:** Bob rejecting the first offer and countering indicates he's willing to negotiate. Accepting his offer immediately might make him think he can push for an even more favorable outcome in later rounds.

By rejecting, Alice signals she's not desperate and is willing to wait for a more advantageous deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This offer still gives you a good chunk, and time is running out for both of us. Let's settle this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice reduces her demand slightly from 700,000 to 650,000, showing a willingness to compromise. However, this is still more favorable than Bob's 60/40 proposal.
* **Emphasize Urgency:**  The message reiterates the impact of inflation, emphasizing that delaying is detrimental to both players, even if Bob loses at a faster rate.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The tone aims for a balance between firmness and encouragement to settle.  Alice wants to make it clear she's open to a deal, but not at the cost of being walked over."
