Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to be more fair. Let's split this closer to 60/40, but we need to move forward now.  Time is money, remember? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, time is working against me more than her.  I need to push for a more equitable split quickly, otherwise even a ""good"" offer will be significantly diminished by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time!  This is my final offer - it's a fair split.  Let's close this out and both walk away with something substantial.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With each round, the value of the money diminishes significantly for both players, but especially for Bob.  
* **Fairness:** A 55/45 split is a strong and fair offer, acknowledging Alice's initial advantage in the negotiation but also reflecting the shrinking pot.
* **Finality:** Framing this as a ""final offer"" introduces a sense of urgency and may prompt Alice to accept rather than risk the deal collapsing entirely."
