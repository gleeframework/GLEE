"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'll consider the current value of my potential gain.

Since the current offer is 70, which is higher than my initial offer of 60, and I don't want to risk going to the next round where the money is worth even less, I'll accept this offer.
