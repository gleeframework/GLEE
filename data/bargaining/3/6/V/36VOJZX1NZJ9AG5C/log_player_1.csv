I'm going for a fairly aggressive opening offer. I want to secure the majority of the money early on, but I'm not being entirely unreasonable to Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very bold with this offer! I won't accept being left with only $10, especially since the value of the money is decreasing. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly more even split this time. Since I rejected his offer, I need to be more reasonable to avoid him getting even more aggressive.  However, I still want to maintain a significant portion of the money."
