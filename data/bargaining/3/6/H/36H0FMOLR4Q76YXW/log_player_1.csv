"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more aggressive offer, but still a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

I don't want to give up 70% of the money, but I also don't want to risk going into the next round with a lower amount of money due to inflation. Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll...

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money and leave 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more to Alice, but I'm still not going to give up too much! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this new offer from Bob...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less, I'll consider this offer carefully.

However, I still think I can do better than 45% of the money. I'll...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer that's a bit more aggressive than my previous one.

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in giving me a slight edge."
