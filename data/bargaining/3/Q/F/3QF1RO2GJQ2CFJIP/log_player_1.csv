"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take this generous offer and we can both walk away happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair offer, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting us!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about splitting it down the middle. Can you offer me a bit more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more considering the risk of inflation!""
}
```"
