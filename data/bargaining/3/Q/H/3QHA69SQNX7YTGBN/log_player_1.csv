Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a slightly larger share. However, my turn now, and I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Consider this carefully, as the pot will shrink next round, and we both lose. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
