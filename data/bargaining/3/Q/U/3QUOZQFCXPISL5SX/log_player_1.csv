Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference, Alice. This ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, I'm not going to accept a deal where I get less than him, especially with inflation eating away at our potential gains. I'll propose something better in the next round."
