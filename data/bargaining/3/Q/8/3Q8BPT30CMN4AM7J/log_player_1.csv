Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the split is more even, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, but 20% less to Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

I'm offering a 70-30 split, with me receiving $700,000 and Bob receiving $300,000. I've included a message saying ""Consider the inflation"" to remind Bob that the money is worth 20% less to him than in the first round, and 40% less than in the first round, so he should be more willing to compromise. Your turn!"
