I propose a 900,000 / 100,000 split. This is a fair and generous offer, considering I'm taking a higher risk with the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering 850,000 to me and 150,000 to Bob. Inflation is biting, and I need to ensure a better return. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is getting greedy!  I'm losing too much to inflation, and this offer is a huge step backwards from the previous round. I need to counter-propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 700,000 to me and 300,000 to Bob. Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still trying to be fair.  This is my final offer.  If Bob rejects, I will not accept any more offers."
