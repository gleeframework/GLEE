"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 80-20 in my favor, with me getting $800,000 and Bob getting $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so my potential gain of $800,000 is now worth $720,000, and Bob's potential gain of $200,000 is now worth $180,000.

I'm not too thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting! With the 27.1% reduction, my potential gain of $600,000 is now worth $437,400, and Bob's potential gain of $400,000 is now worth $304,500.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but it's getting closer to what I was initially hoping for. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not perfect, but it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds."
