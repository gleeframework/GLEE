"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and we can start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, but I'll give you a slightly better deal than the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 2:8 split. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll try to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth significantly less, so I need to adjust my expectations again.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 3:7 split, especially considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation. I'd like to propose another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still need to get a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for myself. This is a more even split, but I'm still trying to get a bit more for myself."
