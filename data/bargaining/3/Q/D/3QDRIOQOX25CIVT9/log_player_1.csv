"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% of the total. You can do better or worse in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, Alice. I'll take a moderate split this time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're right, I was high last time. This time I'll give you a slightly larger share. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to get taken advantage of. I'll match your offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like we're splitting the remaining money evenly, which is a decent outcome considering the inflation."
