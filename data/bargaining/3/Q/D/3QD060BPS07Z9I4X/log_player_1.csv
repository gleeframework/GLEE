"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'll think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less, I'll think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being even more devalued."
