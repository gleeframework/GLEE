"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll get the bigger share, you can have 2000""
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more fair split would be 55/45. This way we both get a decent amount, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future if we need to. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4500 / 0.9 = 5000
* Bob gain: 5500 / 0.9 = 6111.11

I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to my initial generosity. Let's meet in the middle at 60/40""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation and aims to find a more favorable split for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option at this point, considering the inflation and the fact that we've both had to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.713 (1 - 0.287) = 7000
* Bob gain: 5000 / 0.713 = 7000

An even split seems fair, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations.
