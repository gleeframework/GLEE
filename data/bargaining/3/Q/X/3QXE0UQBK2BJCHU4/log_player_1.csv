"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. This is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 60% of what I could have gotten in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about this, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
