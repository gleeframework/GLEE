"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, but the game heavily favors me due to inflation affecting my share. I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but time is money Alice. Let's wrap this up.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want the bigger share! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is barely budging while inflation is eating into my potential gains. I need to hold out for a much better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and my share is shrinking. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. I'm being generous by still offering you 30%! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough spot.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor. However, if I keep rejecting her offers, I risk getting nothing in the end.  I'll hold out one more round and hope she gets nervous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome now. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offers, Bob. Now I'm taking an even bigger share! 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a painful outcome, but I'm in a terrible position now.  The inflation means this offer is barely better than nothing, and if I reject it, Alice is likely to offer me even less next round. I have to cut my losses."
