Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, I'll make a proposal that takes that into account. Here's my offer:

# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money for me, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the difference between the offers is small, I'll choose to accept this one.
