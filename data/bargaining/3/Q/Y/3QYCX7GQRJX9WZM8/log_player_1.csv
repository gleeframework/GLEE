"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will take the offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain in this round would be:

Alice gain: 500000 x 0.8 = 400000
Bob gain: 500000 x 0.8 = 400000

I'm not sure if I'm ready to split it evenly just yet. I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I like the idea of splitting it evenly, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. What about 420000 for me and 380000 for you?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8^2 = 0.64). So, if I were to propose a fixed amount, it would be worth less than in previous rounds.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise on a decent split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but let's make this happen.  Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game goes on!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain in this round would be:

Alice gain: 550000 x 0.512 = 280800
Bob gain: 450000 x 0.512 = 229440

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this offer, especially since it's not a significant increase from my previous offer. I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced this is the best deal. What about 300000 for me and 400000 for you?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 40.96% of its original value (0.8^3 = 0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096). So, if I were to propose a fixed amount, it would be worth even less than in previous rounds.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
