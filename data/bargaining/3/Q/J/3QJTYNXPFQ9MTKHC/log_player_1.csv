"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```
This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a larger share of the remaining amount. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I'll make a new offer. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
This way, I'll get a larger share of the remaining amount, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, so I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk going to Round 5 with even less valuable money.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
