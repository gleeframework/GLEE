"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 90% of the money ($900,000) and let Bob have 10% ($100,000). I'm hoping this will be a fair starting point and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still hoping for a better deal than 40% of the total. I believe I can get a better share in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing to take 70% of the money ($700,000) and let Bob have 30% ($300,000).  Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm going to try and bridge the gap by offering him a slightly better deal. I'm still taking the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  Even with the effects of inflation, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially since there are only 8 rounds left. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk getting nothing in the end."
