Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55 for me and 45 for you is a fairer split, considering the inflation we'll both experience. Let's agree on this and move on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
