"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. It's a fair starting point, and since Bob's money will depreciate faster, it might be tempting for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my previous offer in terms of my gain. While his offer provides more money to him, my share is significantly reduced.  I'll reject and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a better share than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although my share is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'll accept. Inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and my share is still substantial.  Bob's offer is better than my previous offer, so it's a good deal for me."
