I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I want to get the majority of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this in the first round.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still pretty good.  The money is worth less now due to inflation, so it's wiser to accept and get something than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
