# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair.  I'm losing money every round we play with inflation, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the most generous you'll get considering the inflation working against you.  It's time to be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is getting worse! I need to hold strong and show her I'm serious about getting a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a compromise. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share than my last offer to reach an agreement. Time is running out, and it benefits us both to settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a chance to take a significant amount while it's still worth something.  Don't let greed push us further down this road. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a tough game, but her offer is still decreasing.  While the inflation is hurting, I'm betting she'll be more open to a fairer split as we get closer to the deadline. I need to hold my ground a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split that acknowledges the time pressure and the impact of inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid walking away with nothing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking, and your share is shrinking.  This offer is more than fair. Let's be smart and end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me!  While this isn't ideal, accepting a $400,000 offer now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. I have to be realistic about the diminishing returns at this point."
