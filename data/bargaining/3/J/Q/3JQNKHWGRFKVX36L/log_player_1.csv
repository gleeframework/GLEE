"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted values.

For me, $300,000 is worth 95% of $300,000, which is $285,000.
For Bob, $700,000 is worth 80% of $700,000, which is $560,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
