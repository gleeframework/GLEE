Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 4:1 is a more reasonable split considering the initial offer was 3:1 in your favor. This way, I still get a decent chunk, but you still get the majority. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
