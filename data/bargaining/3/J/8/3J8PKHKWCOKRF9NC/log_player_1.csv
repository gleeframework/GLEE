"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount of money to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'm considering an offer of $6,000. However, I'm not sure about the value of the money for Bob, since I don't know the inflation effect on his side.

Considering the offer, I'll play it safe and accept:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
