"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, I'll take a slightly larger share to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept this offer so early on. It's better to see how the inflation plays out and potentially get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split, taking into account the potential inflation. Let's see if we can agree on a fair deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my gain to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a better deal than the first offer, the inflation is still a significant factor. It's better to see if Alice will offer more or if we can reach a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's try an even split. The inflation is affecting us both, and it's important to find a compromise that works for everyone.""
