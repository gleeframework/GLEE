Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Although the offer is not ideal, accepting it is the best strategy at this point. The inflation will continue to devalue Bob's gains, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in future rounds.  It's better to take what's available than risk getting nothing at all."
