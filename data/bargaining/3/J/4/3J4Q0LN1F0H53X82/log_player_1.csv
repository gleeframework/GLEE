"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'll let Bob know how I think we can work together to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk too. Let's see if you'll accept. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is now worth 80% of the original $5000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's a slightly worse deal for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more this time, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more this time, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $4500 I would gain is now worth 90.4% of the original $5000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's a slightly better deal for me compared to the previous round.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a decent compromise.
