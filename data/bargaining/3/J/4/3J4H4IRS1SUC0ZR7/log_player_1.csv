"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more balanced way to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting my earnings.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than a 45% gain. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like to aim higher. Can we discuss further?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my share is now worth 5% less than in round 2. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
