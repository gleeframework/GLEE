"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a slightly more aggressive split, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about the aggressive split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather get a smaller share now than risk getting even less in future rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
