"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I want a little more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less after inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. His gain is too large, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```"

I'll reject Bob's offer again. His gain is still too large, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:
