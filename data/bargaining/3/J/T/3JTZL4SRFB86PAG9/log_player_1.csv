"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $100,000, a fair starting point. You can do better next round, I'm sure!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, which seems reasonable at this point in the game. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling a bit more generous than you, Alice. Let's see if you're willing to play fair. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I think it's a bit too generous for him, considering the first round was already a 90-10 split in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too stingy, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of!""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm still trying to get a decent share of the money."
