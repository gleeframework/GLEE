"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1. This might seem like a generous offer considering the risk of inflation, but remember, the value of the money decreases by 5% with each passing round. Accepting now could prevent potential losses in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
