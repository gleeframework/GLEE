"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1. This might seem like a generous offer considering the risk of inflation, but remember, the value of the money decreases by 5% with each passing round. Accepting now could prevent potential losses in future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I'm not going to give it away for free. I think we can find a better balance in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
