# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's claim that this is his final offer for a fair deal, the terms are still not favorable to me, especially considering that the inflation doesn't affect my gains. By rejecting, I'm pushing Bob to make a more favorable offer in the next round, as the inflation will continue to devalue his potential gains."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I need to get this deal done. This is my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's claim that this is his absolute bottom line, the terms are still not favorable to me, especially considering that the inflation has significantly devalued Bob's potential gains. By rejecting, I'm pushing Bob to make an even more desperate offer in the next round, as the inflation will continue to erode his potential gains.\n\n###\n\nAlso, Bob's message sounds more desperate, indicating that he might be willing to make further concessions. I'll take advantage of this and try to get an even better deal in the next round."

This is a generous offer, considering the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my offer slightly, giving Bob $390,000, while emphasizing that time is not on his side due to the inflation. The message aims to create a sense of urgency, implying that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, the next one might be even less favorable. I'll also try to make Bob feel that I'm being generous, considering the circumstances, in order to make him more likely to accept the offer.\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant devaluation of Bob's potential gains due to inflation, I believe that this offer is still favorable to me, while also being reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting."
