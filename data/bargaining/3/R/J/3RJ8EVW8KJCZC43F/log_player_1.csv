Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's go with 55 for me and 45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand you want a more even split. How about we meet in the middle? 55 for me and 45 for you.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round, the value of the money decreases. While Bob's offer was tempting, it's important to remember the money is losing value faster for me (Alice) than for him.
* **Strategic Counter:** By offering a slight improvement on my previous offer (60/40) but mirroring his desired split, I put pressure on Bob to accept.  He might be willing to take a slightly smaller amount now rather than risk the money devaluing further."
