"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take 60% this time, as I'm sure you'll appreciate the slight inflation advantage I have.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a slightly better deal to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the inflation has hit, it's better to accept this offer.  If I reject, I risk Alice getting a better deal in the next round, and I'll lose even more money."
