"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40, I'm the one making the first offer after all! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share for making the first offer, so I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a strong offer considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my initial offer was quite generous. I'll make a small concession, but I still believe I deserve a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is anchoring her offers around a favorable initial split, but the impact of inflation is significant and accelerating. While her offer is slightly better, it's not enough of a concession given that her potential gains are decreasing at twice the rate of mine. I need to signal I'm willing to wait for a much fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic about the inflation. I'm offering a 52/48 split in my favor. This is a compromise considering the rapidly decreasing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is taking its toll, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is my most generous offer yet, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the inflation impact, but her offer is still not reflecting the rapidly changing reality. While she calls it her ""most generous offer,"" it's a mere 20,000 increase from Round 3, while the value of the money continues to plummet. I need to hold firm and signal I'm prepared to wait for a significantly better split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be pragmatic.  I'm proposing a 51/49 split in my favor. Every round that passes hurts us both. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and rapidly devaluing money.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point. The pressure is on for both of us to make a deal.
* **Shifting Power Dynamic:**  My willingness to reject previous offers demonstrates I'm willing to risk it all for a favorable split.  The inflation disproportionately hurts Alice, so the power dynamic is gradually shifting in my favor. 
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 51/49 is a small concession from my 52/48 offer, signaling a willingness to compromise, but only slightly."
