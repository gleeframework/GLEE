"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer still leaves you with a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split.  We can both get a good amount, and there's still room for negotiation if you'd like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is running out for both of us. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer my previous offer, the inflation is taking its toll.  It's better to accept this and secure some gains than risk losing more in the next round."
