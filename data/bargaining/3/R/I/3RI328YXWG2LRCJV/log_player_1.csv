"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I figure Bob will be tempted to accept it, but if not, we can still negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than my initial offer, but I think I can do better. There are still plenty of rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and I think it's a good starting point for further negotiation if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering me a significantly smaller share than the 50/50 split I proposed.  While inflation is affecting him more, I believe I can still get a better deal, especially with several rounds remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, hoping to find a compromise that Bob will accept. With the remaining rounds, I'm aiming for a slightly more advantageous split while considering inflation's impact on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has hit Bob hard, he's still offering me a decent amount. With fewer rounds remaining, I need to be more practical and secure a deal.  A 450,000 gain is better than risking getting nothing."
