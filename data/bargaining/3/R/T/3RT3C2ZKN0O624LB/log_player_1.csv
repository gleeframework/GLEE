Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round. I'll take almost everything!  It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but I'm hoping to see how he reacts and how he plans to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would love to get more, Bob's offer is significantly better than my last round. I'm not sure how inflation will affect the next round, so I'm going to take this offer and see what happens."
