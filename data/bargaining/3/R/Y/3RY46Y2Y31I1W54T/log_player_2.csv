"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain. I believe this is fair considering the potential for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 3:1 ratio might seem fair initially, considering the inflation factor, it's likely to be significantly less advantageous for Bob in the future rounds. By rejecting, Bob has the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
