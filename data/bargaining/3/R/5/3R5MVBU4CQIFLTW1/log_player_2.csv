Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 30/70, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to 50/50. But considering the inflation, I'll offer a bit more to Alice to make up for the lost value.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 9.75% less, and Alice's gain is worth 19% less, I'll try to adjust my thinking accordingly.

However, this offer is still not 50/50, and I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll reject it for now.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make an offer that's closer to 50/50, but taking into account the reduced value of the money. I'll offer a bit more to Alice to make up for the difference.
