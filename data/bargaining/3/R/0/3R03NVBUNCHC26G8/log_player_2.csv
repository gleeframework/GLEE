"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small slice, but don't worry, I'm sure you'll get a better deal if you reject. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer seems generous, it's important to remember that the money will lose value with each passing round. Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to potentially negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a fairer split. Let's each take a bit over half, considering the value of the money will decrease with each passing round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a fair split, but let's be realistic. We're both losing money with each round. I'm offering you a decent share to keep the game moving forward. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than the previous round, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give up a bit more, but we need to make progress to avoid losing more money.""
}
