6000.0,4000.0,I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money more evenly this time.  I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.  Let's get this done before the inflation eats away any more of our potential gains.,Alice,3,

7000.0,3000.0,"I'm getting tired of this back and forth.  Let's split it 70/30 this time.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with something before this inflation gets out of hand.",Alice,5,

8000.0,2000.0,"This is my final offer. I'm taking a bigger share this time, as the inflation is getting out of control. It's better to take what we can now rather than risk losing more later.  Let's end this game.",Alice,7,
