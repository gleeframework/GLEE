"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, Bob. This offer benefits both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Advantage:** I'm aiming for a slightly larger share (52.5%) to account for the faster devaluation of the money for me. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** This offer is still generous enough that Bob might accept it in the first round, especially since he also loses value over time. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit to encourage Bob's acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we are facing.  It's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the inflation. While he presents it as a compromise, it's significantly worse than my initial offer, even after factoring in the first round of inflation. I believe I have a good chance of securing a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This back and forth isn't helping either of us. I propose a simple 50/50 split. It's fair and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:** The longer this negotiation drags on, the more value we both lose due to inflation. It's becoming increasingly important to settle quickly.
* **Strategic Even Split:** While I aimed for a slight advantage initially, a 50/50 split now presents a strong case:
    * It's undeniably fair, potentially swaying Bob after his previous offer.
    * It avoids further rounds of devaluation, maximizing the final amount for both of us.
* **Direct Message:** The message emphasizes practicality and the need for a swift resolution to a potentially losing game for both parties."
