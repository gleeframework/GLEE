"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer. I believe this is a fair split to begin our negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the negotiations progress. I'm willing to wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This offer considers the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money. Let's make a deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but still not in my favor considering the faster devaluation for me. I'm proposing a slightly better split for me. Let's find an agreement soon! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still not favorable to me, especially with the faster rate of inflation working against me. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is a serious offer considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the pressure, but your 'take it or leave it' approach isn't productive.  I'm offering a compromise - slightly less than my last offer to acknowledge the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting ridiculous. While Alice acknowledges the time pressure, her offer doesn't reflect the urgency. I need to stand my ground, otherwise, I'll be forced to accept a terrible deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting absurd.  The clock is ticking and we're both losing money.  Meet me in the middle or this is going nowhere.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, enough with the games.  It's clear we both want this money.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.  Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is far from ideal, especially considering the initial rounds. However, with the rapid inflation working against us both, and the increasing risk of walking away with nothing, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
