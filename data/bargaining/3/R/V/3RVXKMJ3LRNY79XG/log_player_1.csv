I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob. Hopefully, he'll see this as a good starting point and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, this offer is still better than what I would get if we continue playing. It's a fair split, so I'll accept it."
