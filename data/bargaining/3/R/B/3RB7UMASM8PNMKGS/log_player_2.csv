Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal.  This offer is a step closer to what I want. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the effects of inflation are hitting hard, accepting Alice's offer would mean getting significantly less than half of the money. I need to hold out for a better deal, aiming for at least a 50/50 split, if not better."
