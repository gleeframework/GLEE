I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'm not thrilled with the 30-70 split. I was hoping for a more balanced division.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, let's try 45-55 split""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's try a 50-50 split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a very tempting offer, especially considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation.

After some thought, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.
