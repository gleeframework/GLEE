Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand inflation affects you more, but splitting evenly is the fairest solution.  Let's not risk losing more money by delaying. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to an even split, taking advantage of the fact that he's immune to the inflation.  While the money is losing value, accepting $5,000 now is still better than risking getting nothing if the game goes to the final round. However, there's a chance I can still negotiate a slightly better deal. Bob's message suggests he's getting concerned about the money being lost, which might make him more agreeable to a small concession."

{
""alice_gain"": 5700,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. This is the best outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not budging from the 50/50 split. While not ideal, accepting $5,000 is now the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer I wait, the less appealing even a slightly better offer becomes due to the inflation. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has shown no willingness to deviate from an even split. It's unlikely he'll change his mind in the remaining rounds. 

It's frustrating to settle for less, but taking the guaranteed $5,000 now is the safest and most rational decision at this point."
