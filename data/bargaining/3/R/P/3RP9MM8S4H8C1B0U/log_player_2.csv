"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible offer for Bob. While it might be ""fair"" in terms of a simple 90/10 split, the fact that the money depreciates much faster for Alice means she's getting the better end of the deal by far.  Bob should reject and see what Alice offers in round 2."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, given how the money depreciates.  Let's see if we can agree.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  We're both losing money with each round, so it's in our best interest to come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While a 50/50 split might not have been ideal in the first round, it's the best option at this point.  The money is depreciating rapidly, and each round makes a good deal less likely.  It's time to take what's on the table and avoid getting nothing at all."
