"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount, but don't expect to get the lion's share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I gain is $720,000 (900,000 x 0.8).

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
