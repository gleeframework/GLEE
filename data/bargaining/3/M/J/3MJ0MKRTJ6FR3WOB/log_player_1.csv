"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm trying to be generous and start with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted an even split, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. He's trying to take a big chunk of the money, and I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk too""}

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than my initial proposal, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
