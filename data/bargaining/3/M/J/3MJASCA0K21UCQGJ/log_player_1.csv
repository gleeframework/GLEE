"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more fair split, considering the work I've done. Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to flip the script and offer me the smaller share this time.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to give myself a slightly larger share, taking into account the effects of inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
