"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a more fair split, considering the work I've done. Let's call it a day."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a 60/40 split, the inflation is starting to bite. This offer is a decent compromise, and I'm willing to take it."
