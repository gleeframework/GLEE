"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, but I'll give you more than 50% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value for me, but I'm willing to negotiate.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. I'll get $400,000, which is still a decent amount, and Bob will get $600,000.
