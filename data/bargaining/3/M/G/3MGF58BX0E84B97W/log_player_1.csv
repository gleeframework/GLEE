Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fairer split. This way, we both have a good chunk of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need a better deal than the last two rounds.  We're both losing value with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation on his gains. While my potential gains have decreased, his have plummeted.  He needs to offer significantly more for me to accept at this stage. I'm betting he'll get more desperate soon."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I need a better return than the last few rounds. Inflation is eating away at our potential winnings. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is finally starting to understand the pressure of inflation, but his offer is still not good enough.  He needs to realize that the longer this drags on, the more beneficial it is for me to simply wait for a larger share. I need to hold firm to push him towards a more favorable split."

Round 7

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing out with each passing round. This is a decent offer for both of us, let's end this before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is getting ridiculous. Bob's offer is outrageously in his favor, even considering the inflation. He's clearly hoping I'll panic as we get closer to the deadline. However, I'm confident that if I hold out, he'll be forced to make a much better offer in the next couple of rounds. He has much more to lose than I do at this point."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair offer at this point. Take it or leave it, but time is running out for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Bob needs to understand that I'm serious about waiting for a fair deal. Offering a 50/50 split might seem risky, but it's a strong signal that I'm not going to back down. With only three rounds left, he'll be feeling the pressure to accept something reasonable."
