Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your need for a bigger share, Alice. But this offer is more equitable given the devaluation rates. Let's split it this way for a fair outcome. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
