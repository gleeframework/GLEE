"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money I gain as 60 dollars, not 40.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer because I'm not getting the better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 0% less than in round 2, I'll aim for a better deal for myself. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering to take 55 dollars and leaving 45 dollars for Bob."
