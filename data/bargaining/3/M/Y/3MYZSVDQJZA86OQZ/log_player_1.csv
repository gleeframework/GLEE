"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. I included a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, and I'm hoping Bob will see my offer as a reasonable starting point for negotiations. Let me know what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's start with this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel any pressure to accept a less favorable offer. Additionally, Bob's offer of a 45-55 split is less favorable to me than my initial offer of a 60-40 split. I'm hoping that in future rounds, Bob will be more willing to compromise as the value of the money decreases for him. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 42 dollars and keeping 58 dollars for myself. Since Bob's previous offer was a 45-55 split, I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a slightly more favorable split to myself while still being more generous than my initial offer. I included a message saying ""Meet me in the middle?"" to encourage Bob to see this as a compromise and consider accepting my offer. Let me know what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. This is the last round I'll offer this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel any pressure to accept an even split. Additionally, Bob's offer of an even split is less favorable to me than my previous offers, and I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get. Bob's message says this is the last round they'll offer an even split, but I'm willing to take that risk and see what happens in future rounds. With the value of the money decreasing for Bob, I'm hoping they'll become more desperate to make a deal and offer me a more favorable split. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Last chance for a good deal""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 43 dollars and keeping 57 dollars for myself. Since Bob's previous offer was an even split, I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the value of the money is decreasing for them. I'm offering a slightly less favorable split to Bob than my previous offer, but still more generous than my initial offer. I included a message saying ""Last chance for a good deal"" to put pressure on Bob and make them think that if they don't accept this offer, they'll get an even worse deal in future rounds. Let me know what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging from my previous offer. We're both losing value with every round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's the same offer they made in Round 2, which I already rejected. Bob's message says they're not budging from their previous offer, but I'm not convinced that they won't change their mind in future rounds. With the value of the money decreasing rapidly for Bob, I'm hoping they'll become more desperate to make a deal and offer me a more favorable split. Additionally, Bob's offer of a 45-55 split is still less favorable to me than my previous offers, and I'm not willing to accept it. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""You're running out of time""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 44 dollars and keeping 56 dollars for myself. Since Bob's previous offer was the same as their offer in Round 2, I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for them. I'm offering a slightly less favorable split to Bob than my previous offer, but still more generous than my initial offer. I included a message saying ""You're running out of time"" to put pressure on Bob and make them think that if they don't accept this offer, they'll get an even worse deal in future rounds or risk losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. Let me know what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is it. We both get the same amount, or we get nothing. It's the only fair deal left. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is not willing to budge from an even split. With the value of the money decreasing rapidly for Bob, I'm starting to think that an even split might be the best deal I can get. Additionally, Bob's message says that this is the only fair deal left, and I'm starting to believe that they're willing to walk away with nothing rather than accept a less favorable split. Since I'm not losing any value due to inflation, I'm essentially getting the same value as I would have in the first round, but Bob is losing a significant amount of value. I think it's time to accept the offer and guarantee that I get at least something, rather than risking everything by trying to negotiate further."
