**Reasoning:**

It's time to be pragmatic. Although I would prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the best move to minimize losses from inflation. Here's why:

* **Inflation is eating profits:**  Every round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller reward for both of us.
* **Guaranteed payout:** Accepting this offer guarantees me $480,000. Rejecting it risks a worse offer in the next round, potentially leaving me with even less.
* **Bob's likely strategy:**  Bob seems to be employing a strategy of alternating between slightly favorable offers for himself.  If I reject this, he might offer me even less in the next round, knowing I'm feeling the pressure of inflation. 

While not ideal, accepting a slightly smaller share now is better than risking a much smaller share later."
