"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting away with all the money that easily! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $480,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but I'm still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair share, let's call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting worried that I'll be left with very little if we continue. Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is a tempting one, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up my advantage just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I need to be more aggressive. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $520,000, which is a slight increase from his previous offer, but I'm still trying to maintain the upper hand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, it's my turn to dictate the terms! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer of $400,000 is a significant reduction from my previous offers, but I'm starting to think that it might be the best option to get something rather than risking losing everything.
