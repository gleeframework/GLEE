Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. I'm offering a more balanced split that takes inflation into account. Let's agree and secure some of this money before it's all gone. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is becoming increasingly critical. Accepting now would mean losing almost 20% of the initial potential gain for Bob.  It's worth risking another counter-offer to try and secure a slightly better deal."
