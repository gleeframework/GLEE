"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a 20% share for Bob, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's structure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take more this time! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial generosity!

Given the inflation, my share of $7,000 is actually worth 7,000 / 0.9 = $7,778 in the previous round's money.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, considering I'm getting less than I would have in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my share is now worth 10% less than the previous round. My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6300,
  ""bob_gain"": 3700,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with a free ride. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent 37% of the total. Let's see if he's willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to dictate the terms now!

Given the inflation, my share of $5,000 is actually worth 5,000 / 0.271 = $18,443 in the first round's money. However, considering the current value, I'm getting a decent share, but I'm not thrilled about the equal split.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise and we can finally end the game.
