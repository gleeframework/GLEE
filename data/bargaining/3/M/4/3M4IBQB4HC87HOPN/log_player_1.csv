"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 10% and take the rest.""

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 10% last round, I'll give you 40% this round. Fairer? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal!

I'm not convinced that 40% is a significant enough increase from the initial 10% offer, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to see a more substantial increase.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% this round, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation.""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns, offering the same deal as before. I'm not sure if he's bluffing or genuinely thinks I'll accept it.

Considering the inflation has taken a bigger toll on me this round, I'm not eager to give up more than I have to. However, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to get a better deal in the next round.

# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is mirroring my previous offer, but with a slight twist. Considering the inflation has taken an even bigger hit on me this round, I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up the edge I had.

However, I'm also aware that the next round might be my last chance to get a good deal, considering the inflation will continue to erode the value of the money.
