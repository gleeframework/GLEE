Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. I propose taking $60 and you get $40. It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against you.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. Let's meet in the middle - I propose a 55/45 split. This way we both get something substantial before the value drops too much. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
