Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and we both get a decent amount.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation is a serious factor, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the following rounds.  It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all."
