"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $1,000,000, which is $400,000. I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000. My message to Bob is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer!"
