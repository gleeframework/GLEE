"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'm feeling generous!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm feeling generous, but I'm also trying to get a good chunk of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to be kind 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. $400,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more conservative proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still a significant chunk of the original $1,000,000. I'm hoping to find a mutually acceptable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, let's find a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns!

Considering the inflation and the fact that his offer is the same as the previous one, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, despite the inflation, I was hoping for a better deal. Since the offer is the same as before, I think I can try to negotiate for a slightly better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $480,000, which is a bit less than my previous offer, but still a decent chunk of the original $1,000,000. I'm trying to create some pressure to get a deal done."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to stick to his guns!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is taking a significant toll on my potential gains, and I think it's time to cut my losses and get a deal done. $480,000 is a decent chunk of the original $1,000,000, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal."
