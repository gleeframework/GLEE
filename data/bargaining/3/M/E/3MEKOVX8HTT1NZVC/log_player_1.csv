"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 90% of the money and let Bob have the remaining 10%. This is a good starting point as it allows me to secure a significant portion of the money while still leaving a reasonable amount for Bob. It's important to be fair, but also to prioritize maximizing my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I am willing to accept a lesser share, but I am not ready to settle for only 30% of the money. I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable offer that recognizes the dwindling value of the money due to inflation. I believe this is the best way to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share,  Bob's offer is now more than what I offered in the previous round, and the value of the money continues to decline.  It is in my best interest to accept this offer to avoid risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
