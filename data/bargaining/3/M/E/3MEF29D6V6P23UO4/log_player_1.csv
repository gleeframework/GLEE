Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a good amount before inflation kicks in. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I still need a reasonable share to make it worthwhile with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

While Bob is becoming more amenable, accepting a 60/40 split would be leaving money on the table from Alice's perspective. The game is still early enough that pushing for a more favorable outcome is the better strategy.  Bob's increasing awareness of inflation will hopefully push him towards a more agreeable offer in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a little worried about the inflation now. This offer is closer to your previous ones, but still gives me a good amount.  Let's make a deal before things get worse. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and his offer is getting much closer to a desirable split for Alice.  While 550,000 is a respectable sum, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that Alice is serious about getting a better deal and that he needs to improve his offer significantly to avoid getting a much smaller amount as the rounds progress."
