Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is more than fair, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit, but this is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I think you can do better, especially with inflation eating away at your share 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. While the situation is getting worse with each round, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than Bob is not in my best interest. I need to hold firm and hope he understands the time pressure is affecting us both."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and inflation is hurting me more than you. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I need to signal to Bob that I am serious about getting a reasonable deal, but I also need to be conscious of the dwindling value of the money.  Offering him slightly more than before, while still aiming for a slight advantage, might be enough to get him to agree before the inflation eats away at my share even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, time is running out, but I think I can afford to wait a bit longer. This is my new offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The situation is getting critical. With every round, the inflation eats away at my potential gains. While this offer is far from ideal, rejecting it risks even worse offers from Bob in the following rounds, potentially leaving me with nothing. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to secure something than risk everything."
