Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  This way, I maximize my share while still leaving some room for negotiation in case he wants more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer and get something.  I'm already losing 10% of my potential earnings due to inflation, and I don't know how many more rounds it will take for Bob to budge. This seems like a fair compromise, especially since my share will likely be significantly smaller if I reject this offer and Bob gets to propose next round."
