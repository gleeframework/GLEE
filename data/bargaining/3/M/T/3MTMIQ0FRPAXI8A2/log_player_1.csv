I'm trying to be generous enough to entice Bob to accept, but not so generous that I give away too much. The message ""Let's make a fair deal"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more likely to accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. If he rejects it, I'll be happy to make a new offer in the next round."
