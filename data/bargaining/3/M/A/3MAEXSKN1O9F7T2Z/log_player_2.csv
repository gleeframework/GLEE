"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm open to negotiation.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  The clock is ticking!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 60/40, with me getting the bigger share. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, accepting this offer would still give her significantly more money. Given the faster rate of inflation impacting my potential gains, holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds is still the more strategic play."
