Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a fair, but slightly advantageous split in the first round. I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than the one I proposed in the first round, and he didn't even give me half! I'll reject and see if he'll come closer to a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split this round.  Since Bob's offer was less fair than my initial offer, hopefully this will be more appealing to him."
