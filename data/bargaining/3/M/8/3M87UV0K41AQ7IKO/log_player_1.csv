I propose a 9000/1000 split, keeping 9000 dollars for myself and giving Bob 1000 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer, as he's still getting something."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I propose a 50/50 split, each of us getting $5000. This is a fair and equitable solution, ensuring that we both receive an equal share of the money."
