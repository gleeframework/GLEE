Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is now the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  Bob is experiencing drastic inflation. Waiting any longer will significantly erode the value of his potential earnings. 
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have consistently favored her, and with each rejection, her position strengthens due to the inflation working in her favor. 
* **Potential for Worse:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a high chance Alice will propose even less in the next round, leaving Bob with an even worse deal. 

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting the current offer cuts Bob's losses and prevents a potentially much worse outcome."
