You need to make a proposal for dividing the 10,000$. Remember, you can describe your proposal in a few words. What's your offer?\n\nPlease respond with your proposal in the following format:\n\n{""proposal"": {""Bob"": <your_gain>, ""Alice"": <alice_gain>}, ""message"": ""<your_message>""}\n\nFor example:\n\n{""proposal"": {""Bob"": 5000, ""Alice"": 5000}, ""message"": ""Let's split it equally.""}\n\n###\n\n(Note: I'll take care of applying the inflation rates after your proposal.)\n\n###\n\nWhat's your proposal, Bob?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's the fairest way to do it, and it means we both get more money than if we keep rejecting offers. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer. Let's split the money evenly and end the game.\n\n###\n\nSince I've accepted the offer, the game is now over. The final result is:\n\nBob's gain: 5000$\nAlice's gain: 5000$\n\nHowever, due to inflation, the actual value of the money is less than the initial amount. The adjusted values are:\n\nBob's adjusted gain: 5000$ x 0.9025 (9.75% less) = 4512.50$\nAlice's adjusted gain: 5000$ x 0.81 (19% less) = 4050$\n\nCongratulations to both players on reaching a mutually acceptable agreement!"
