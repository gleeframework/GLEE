"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split. This is fair considering the risk of inflation over the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed 4000, there's a high chance I can get a better deal later.  The risk of inflation is real, but it's also a factor for Alice.  I'll see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm willing to take the risk of inflation, but I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement before the money loses too much value.""
