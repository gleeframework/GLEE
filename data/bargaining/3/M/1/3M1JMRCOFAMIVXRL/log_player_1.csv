"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money. Let me know what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'm getting a better deal than Bob. I'll accept this offer.
