60.0,40.0,I'm standing firm. This is a fair deal considering the inflation working against me.,Alice,3,

56.0,44.0,"Bob, a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, but it doesn't account for how inflation is affecting us differently. I'm coming down to 56, which is a real compromise on my part.",Alice,7,
