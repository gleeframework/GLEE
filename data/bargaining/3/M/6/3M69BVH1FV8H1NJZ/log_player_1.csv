"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a very lopsided split in my favor.  This is just to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  Bob is clearly willing to take a significant portion, and the inflation will only hurt me more in future rounds."
