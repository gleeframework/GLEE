999000.0,1000.0,"Let's be fair, I'll take 99.9% and you get the rest.  It's a good deal for you, considering inflation will eat away at your share if we keep playing.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1000.0,999000.0,"I'm going to take 99.9% this time. You get the rest. It's fair. Think about it, each round that passes will make your share worth even less.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
998000.0,2000.0,"Okay, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to let you take almost everything. Let's be reasonable here - we both have to get something out of this.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
2000.0,998000.0,"Let's be realistic. I'll give you a little more, but I need to get most of the money. We both know this is the best outcome, given the current inflation rate. It's a win-win, really.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
995000.0,5000.0,"Look, I'm not going to play this game forever. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not letting you take everything. If we keep going, the inflation will hurt us both. Let's agree on this and move on.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,995000.0,"Let's be reasonable. This offer is fair given the current inflation rate, and we can both walk away with a good deal.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I can't let you take the majority.  If we keep playing, we'll both lose money due to inflation.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
990000.0,10000.0,"Okay, Bob, I'm getting tired of this. I'm giving you a bigger share, but this is my final offer. If you reject it, we're both going to lose a lot more money due to inflation. Let's be smart and end this now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  It's time to end this.  I'm willing to give you a good share, but I can't let you take the majority.  This offer is fair and will help us both avoid further losses.  Let's call it a day.",Bob,8,
