"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."

# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 20% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After some thought, I've decided to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 70/30 split, and I think I can do better. Let's keep negotiating!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 is fair!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 80/20 split, and I think I can do better. I'm not getting desperate yet, and I'm willing to keep negotiating to get a fairer share. Bring on the next offer!"

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's give you a bigger share""}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offer. I'm trying to be more conciliatory and see if we can find a mutually acceptable solution."
