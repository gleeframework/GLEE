Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. This offer heavily favors me, but it's a chance for you to get something before inflation eats away at your potential gains. Think carefully. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
