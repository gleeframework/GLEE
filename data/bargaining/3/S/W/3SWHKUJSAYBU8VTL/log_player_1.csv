"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple proposal, hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me with a slightly biased split.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not that generous, I'd like a better split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, and I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being reasonable, considering the decreasing value of money."
