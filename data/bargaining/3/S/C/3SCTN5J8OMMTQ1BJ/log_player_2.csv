**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Waiting longer means getting significantly less, even if I can negotiate a slightly better split.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The difference between Alice's current offer and my previous one is relatively small, especially when considering the impact of inflation.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:** If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both risk walking away with nothing.

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than gamble on a slightly larger sum and risk losing it all."
