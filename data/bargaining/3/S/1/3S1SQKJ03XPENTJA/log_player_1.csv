Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it 60/40, but you'll have to take the smaller end this time.  The game is getting more expensive for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer might seem tempting at first glance, it's important to remember that the value of his share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. By rejecting this offer, we put pressure on Bob to offer a larger share in the next round to compensate for the decreasing value of the money from his perspective."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, time is money.  I'll take 65% and we can both move on.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, which works in our favor. Delaying the agreement further erodes the value of his potential share.
* **Strong Position:** We rejected his offer, showing we're serious about getting a larger share.  
* **Compromise (slightly):**  While we want a significant share,  increasing our demand to 65% shows a willingness to negotiate but keeps the pressure on Bob."
