"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game has just started. The message is a gentle nudge to accept the offer, implying that taking a bit more than half is still a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can split this more evenly.  Let's try a 55/45 split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, Bob's gain of $55 in this round is actually worth less than the $55 in the first round. Meanwhile, my gain remains constant. I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, possibly getting more than $45 or trying to make Bob accept a lower amount due to the inflation affecting his gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share to $57, but the message points out that due to inflation, Bob's share of $43 is actually a better deal for him compared to the previous round. This is an attempt to make Bob realize that accepting this offer would be in his best interest, given the decreasing value of the money for him over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it down the middle.  Inflation is hurting us both, so let's not let it get any worse. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because Bob's message is misleading - inflation is only hurting him, not me. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I have no incentive to accept a 50/50 split. I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, taking advantage of the fact that Bob is the one being affected by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed hurting you, so let's settle this before it gets worse for you""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share to $62, while pointing out to Bob that inflation is indeed affecting him negatively. The message is a mix of empathy and pressure, trying to make Bob realize that accepting this offer would be in his best interest, given that the value of the money for him will continue to decrease over time. By settling now, Bob can at least get $38, which is better than potentially getting an even lower amount in future rounds."
