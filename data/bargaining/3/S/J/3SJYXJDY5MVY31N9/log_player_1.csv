"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair, considering I'm taking the risk of going to the next round. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to give Bob 60% of the total amount, especially since I don't know how much the money is worth to him due to the inflation. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a better split. Let's try again!""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and offer Bob a slightly smaller share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
