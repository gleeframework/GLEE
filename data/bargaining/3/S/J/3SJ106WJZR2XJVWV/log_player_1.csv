Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the pressure of inflation, but I still believe a more equal split is fair. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation but is still severely undervaluing Alice's position.  While a 60/40 split might sound ""fair"" in a vacuum, Alice holds a strong advantage due to the inflation mechanic.  She needs to hold out for a better offer."
