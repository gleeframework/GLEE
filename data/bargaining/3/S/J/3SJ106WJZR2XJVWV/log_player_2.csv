"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer. I believe this split reflects the advantage I have in this game. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you! I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but the clock is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure of inflation, but I still believe a more equal split is fair. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  The inflation is eating into your share with every passing round.  60/40 is more than generous considering. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nSince the money I gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, and considering Alice's message that this is her final offer, I think it's best to accept this offer rather than risking further loss due to inflation. The current offer of $400,000, even with the reduced value, seems more secure than the possibility of getting a better deal in the next round."
