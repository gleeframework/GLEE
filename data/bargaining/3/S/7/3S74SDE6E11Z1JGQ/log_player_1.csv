Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in his favor when considering the impact of inflation. I'm aiming to secure at least 65% of the initial amount, and I'm willing to push Bob a bit further to see if he'll concede."

# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the pressure from inflation now, and his offers are creeping upwards. However, I'm still in a strong position. Rejecting this offer and proposing something closer to a 60/40 split in my favor might be enough to get Bob to agree in the next round."

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and Bob is finally making significant moves towards a more balanced split. While my ideal outcome was 60/40, accepting 57/43 ensures I get a substantial share before inflation further erodes Bob's portion and potentially leads to a worse outcome for both of us in later rounds."
