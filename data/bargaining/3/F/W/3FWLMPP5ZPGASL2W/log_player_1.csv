"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative value of the offer. In terms of the original $100, Bob's offer is still a 40-60 split, but for me, it's more like a 32-68 split in terms of the original value.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the offer in terms of the original $100.

Since my money is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, the effective value of the offer is:

* My gain: 35 / 0.5192 (1 - 0.488) = 67.3% of the original $100
* Bob's gain: 65 / 1 = 65% of the original $100

This offer is a 67.3-32.7 split, which is not very favorable for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increasing inflation. I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the offer in terms of the original $100.

Since my money is worth 67.23% less due to inflation, the effective value of the offer is:

* My gain: 30 / 0.3267 (1 - 0.6733) = 91.7% of the original $100
* Bob's gain: 70 / 1 = 70% of the original $100

This offer is a 91.7-8.3 split, which is extremely unfavorable for me. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
