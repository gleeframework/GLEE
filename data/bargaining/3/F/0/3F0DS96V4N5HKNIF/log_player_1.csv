"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer seems fair, giving Bob a small amount to ensure he might accept it in the first round.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unfair, even with the inflation. It's much better to continue the game and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900} 
```

Since Bob rejected my offer last round, I'm lowering my share by a smaller amount to try and entice him.  I'm still prioritizing getting a good amount for myself, but I'm also accounting for the fact that the money is worth less with each passing round. Let's see if he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  While the inflation has hit me harder than the first round, it's still not worth taking such a small share.  I'll continue to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710} 
```

I'm going to continue the pattern of decreasing my share by a smaller amount each round. This should keep Bob interested in accepting, while still giving me a decent amount.  Let's see if this works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. The inflation is starting to take a toll, but I'm still going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
```

I'm going to continue my strategy of decreasing my share by a smaller amount each round.  While the inflation is getting worse, it's still better to try to get a good deal than to accept a low offer from Bob.  I'm hoping that he'll realize that his offers are too low and that he needs to compromise to get any money at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offers, it's still not acceptable considering the inflation. I'm going to keep holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096} 
```

I'm still using the same strategy of decreasing my share by a smaller amount each round, but this time I'm going to try a slightly larger decrease. The inflation is now really starting to hurt, so I need to strike a balance between getting a good deal for myself and ensuring that Bob doesn't walk away with nothing. Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard now, and there's a real risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting. While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the situation. It's better to get something than nothing at this point."
