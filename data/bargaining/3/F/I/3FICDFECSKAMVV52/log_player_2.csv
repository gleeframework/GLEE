"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split somewhat evenly, but slightly in my favor considering I'm making the first offer. This ensures we both benefit from acting sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more since I'm making the offer this round, but it's still relatively fair considering the decreasing value of money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. Let's be pragmatic and split this evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take the pragmatic approach and accept the even split before the value decreases further."
