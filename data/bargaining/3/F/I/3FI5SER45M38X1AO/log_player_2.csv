Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for us, and it's depreciating fast. I'm proposing a compromise for a quick deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer is more than fair considering the inflation.  Take it or leave it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away even more of your potential gain. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are significant at this point. Accepting Alice's offer results in a larger net gain for me than holding out for a potentially better deal in a future round, where inflation would further erode the value.
