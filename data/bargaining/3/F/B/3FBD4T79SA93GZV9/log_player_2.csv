"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this 1000$ and let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While $1000 is something, it's far from a fair share. I'll see what Alice's next offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this down the middle, Alice. It's a fair deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40. This is the last offer I'm making. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a 50/50 split, the inflation is making the money I gain worth significantly less. It's better to take this deal than risk getting nothing in the next round."
