"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer is designed to be appealing to Bob, as he gets a small amount of money right away. It also leaves a lot of room for me (Alice) to negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer gives me a significant sum, I believe I can get a better deal in the future. I'm rejecting this offer to leverage the inflation factor and potentially secure a larger share later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my share by 300,000, while still giving Bob a considerable amount.  The inflation will likely affect my earnings less than in the next round, so I'm aiming for a larger share now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering a larger sum than in the previous round, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. The inflation is now significant, and I am unwilling to settle for a smaller share. I'm rejecting this offer to potentially secure a larger share in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This offer is a compromise.  Inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still hoping to get a significant portion of the money.  I'm increasing my share from the previous round while still giving Bob a reasonable offer.  Let's see if he's willing to settle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hitting hard now, and I'm risking losing even more by rejecting. While this offer is significantly less than I hoped for, it's better than getting nothing. I'm accepting to minimize my losses."
