"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can negotiate further if you'd like.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50, you take 50. It's a fair split, and we can avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the money I gain is worth less due to inflation, this offer is still a fair split. It's better to accept and end the game now rather than risk getting a worse offer in the next round."
