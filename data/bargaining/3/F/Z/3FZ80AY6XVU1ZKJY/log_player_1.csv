"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round.  I'll take 6000, you take 4000.  I'm feeling generous, but I think we can both agree that my offer is more fair.   
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'd be getting 5400 in real terms, not 4000.

I don't think Bob's offer is more fair, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my share is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%). So, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8100,
  ""bob_gain"": 1900,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 8100, and you can have 1900. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. We can both agree that we are both  being affected by inflation, so it is a fair compromise.   
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken a significant toll, and my share is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%). Considering the 50/50 split, I'd be getting 7290 in real terms, not 5000.

I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, especially considering the inflation. I'd rather accept this offer than wait for a potentially worse deal.
