"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a bigger share, and I'm not sure if the 2000 I'd get is worth it considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent chunk of the money for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Oh no, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm really struggling to make ends meet. Bob's offer is still too generous for him and not enough for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""I'll take a hit, but I need a bit more to survive""}

I'm really feeling the pinch of inflation, and I'm willing to sacrifice some of my share to try to get a slightly better deal. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and give me a bit more."
