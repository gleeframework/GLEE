Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for you. Take this deal and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action. The inflation is hurting Bob significantly, and continuing to reject offers will only lead to a worse outcome.  It's better to secure a decent gain than risk losing even more."
