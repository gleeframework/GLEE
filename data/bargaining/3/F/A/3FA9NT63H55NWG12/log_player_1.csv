"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nAs Alice, I'll start by proposing a division of $1,000,000 where I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal. If he rejects it, the game will proceed to the next round, and he'll make a counteroffer. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases due to inflation, affecting both of us but impacting Bob more significantly.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to proceed with the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 65/35 is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Given the impact of inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that favors me more. While Bob's proposed split of 65/35 might seem fair to him, considering the higher rate of inflation affecting his share, I'm not convinced it's the best outcome for me. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Bob and let's continue the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a new offer considering the decreased value of money due to inflation. My proposal is to receive $580,000, while Bob receives $420,000. Given the higher rate of inflation affecting Bob's share, I believe this split is more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Bob. I've included a message suggesting that we should compromise and accept this deal before the value of the money decreases further.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to my offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's compromise on 58-42 before it gets worse!""}"
