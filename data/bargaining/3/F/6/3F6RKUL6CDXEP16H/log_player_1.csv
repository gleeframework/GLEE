Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any further negotiations."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the high road, but you'll have to settle for less. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up much. What's your next move, Bob?""
}
```

# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
