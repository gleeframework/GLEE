"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This way, I get 75% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, my gain of $750,000 is now worth $712,500.

Bob's offer of $400,000 for me is worth $380,000, and $600,000 for him is still $600,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
