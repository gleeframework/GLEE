"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make a concession, but I think 70-30 is a more reasonable split, considering the current market conditions and the reduced value of Bob's gains due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is far from ideal, it's better than nothing. Accepting means Bob gets something, while rejecting means he gets nothing at all.  The inflation has significantly eroded the value of his gains, so taking what's available is the most rational choice at this point."
