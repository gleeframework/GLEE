"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, which means he's actually gaining less than he initially proposed.

Considering the 55-45 split, I'm not thrilled about giving up 5% of my potential gain. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 65-35 is a more reasonable split, considering the current market conditions.""}

I'm trying to push for a slightly more favorable split, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go back to the starting point - a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a good compromise considering the inflationary pressures. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer again. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means he's gaining even less than he initially proposed.

Considering the 60-40 split, I'm not thrilled about giving up 10% of my potential gain. I think I can do better.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a concession, but I think 70-30 is a more reasonable split, considering the current market conditions and the reduced value of Bob's gains due to inflation.""}

I'm trying to push for a slightly more favorable split, taking into account the reduced value of Bob's gains due to inflation."
