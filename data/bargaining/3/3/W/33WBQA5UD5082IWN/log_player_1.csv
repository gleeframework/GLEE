"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I take $60 and Bob takes $40. Given the rules of inflation, where the money's value decreases more significantly for me with each round, I'm inclined to try and settle the division early on. By offering Bob $40, I'm hoping to appeal to his interest in securing a substantial amount upfront, considering the diminishing value of money as the rounds progress. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" aims to convey a sense of compromise and fairness, acknowledging that while I'm taking more, it's still a reasonable split that allows both parties to walk away with a considerable amount, especially considering the looming threat of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more in my favor. This is still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer in this round. While the impact of inflation is significant, especially on my share, accepting $45 in the second round would mean I'm getting a value equivalent to $36 if we consider the original value in round 1 (due to the 20% decrease). Meanwhile, Bob's share decreases by 10%, but he still ends up with a larger portion. Given that we are only in the second round and there are 10 more rounds to go, I believe there's room for further negotiation. Accepting this early could lead to an uneven split that doesn't account for the full dynamics of the game, including the potential pressure of future inflation on both our shares. By rejecting, I aim to push for a more favorable division in the next rounds, considering the game's progression and the effects of inflation on both our potential gains."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation and the rejection of the previous offers, my strategy now is to propose a division that slightly adjusts my initial offer to be more favorable to Bob, while still considering the impact of inflation on my share. By offering $58 for myself and $42 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges Bob's desire for a larger share as proposed in his offer, while also protecting my interests. The message ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle"" aims to communicate my willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable division that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but especially for me, as the rounds progress.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly. This is the best you'll get with inflation in play. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, with a 48.8% decrease in value since the first round, and the fact that we are now in the fourth round with 8 more rounds to potentially go, the offer of an even split seems reasonable. While initially, I aimed for a larger share, the progressive decrease in value due to inflation makes the current offer of $50 for each of us more appealing, especially when factoring in the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer secures a tangible amount now rather than risking a potentially worse outcome due to inflation. Bob's message suggesting this is the best I'll get with inflation in play also indicates a willingness to settle, which aligns with my current assessment of the game's progression and the diminishing returns for both parties."
