"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division, 90% for me, 10% for you.  Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 10% share is tempting, there's a lot of money at stake, and there's no reason to believe that Alice will be any more generous in the future. It's worth risking a round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a 45% share, which is a generous starting point. We can both get a good chunk of this money, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 60/40.  This offer is fair considering inflation, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something. The inflation rate is high, and continuing to negotiate risks losing even more. 40% is a reasonable gain, especially considering the potential for further losses."
