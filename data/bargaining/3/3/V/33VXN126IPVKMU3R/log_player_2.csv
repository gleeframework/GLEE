"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I'm taking on the risk with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round.  It's worth it to try and get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  We both get a fair amount and avoid the risk of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's compromise. I'll take a little less than last time, but I still need a cushion against inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is taking a smaller share than the first round, and I'm getting a better deal than my own proposal in the last round.  It's worth accepting to avoid further inflation."
