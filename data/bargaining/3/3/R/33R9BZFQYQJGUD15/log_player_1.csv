Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant inflation for you, I think an 80-20 split is reasonable. The money is worth much less for you now, so it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further loss. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money Alice gains. While a 20% share is not ideal, accepting is the best option to salvage anything at all.  Further rounds will only make the situation worse."
