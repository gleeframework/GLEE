"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. I'm taking a bit of a risk by proposing a very uneven split, but I think it's worth it to secure a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant improvement from his previous proposal, it's still not fair. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but still aiming for a majority share.  We're both losing money with each round, so I need to incentivize him to accept before the value drops too much further."
