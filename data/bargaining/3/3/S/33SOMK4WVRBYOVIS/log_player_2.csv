"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. This factors in the inflation and gives us both a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being reasonable, considering the inflation hit me harder 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to frame the rapidly increasing inflation as a point of compromise, but it's heavily in my favor to keep rejecting.  She's losing value far faster than I am.  While her offers are incrementally getting better, I need to push for a much larger share while time is on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 68, ""alice_gain"": 32, ""message"": ""The inflation is getting serious, Alice. This is my best offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand significantly to capitalize on the inflation disparity.  My message is designed to sound firm but fair, emphasizing the urgency of the situation for Alice.  She's getting desperate, and this offer, while heavily favoring me, might be her best chance to salvage anything substantial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather get something than risk nothing, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting nervous, and her message reflects that.  However, her offer is still not significantly better than before. We're past the halfway point, and she's feeling the pressure.  I'm willing to risk a couple more rounds to see if I can push my advantage further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're down to the wire.  Alice knows if this round fails, she's in a very weak position.
* **Firm Stance:**  ""Final offer"" language signals I'm not budging. This can prompt her to accept rather than risk a worse outcome.
* **Greed vs. Need:**  75/25 heavily favors me, but even a small share is better than nothing for Alice at this point. She's likely to be swayed by the guarantee of at least getting something."
