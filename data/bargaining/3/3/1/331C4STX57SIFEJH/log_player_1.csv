I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, giving myself the lion's share. I figure that since Bob has no idea how inflation affects him, he might be more likely to accept a smaller share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer to get more, I don't know how inflation affects Bob. Accepting a 50/50 split is a good way to ensure I get a fair share, especially since it's likely that Bob will be less generous in future rounds."
