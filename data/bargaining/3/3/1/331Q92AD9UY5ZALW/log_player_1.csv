"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $1,000 I would gain is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $800. The $9,000 Bob would gain is still worth $9,000.

Considering the new values, I think this offer is a bit more favorable for me. I'll accept this offer.
