Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While the money is worth less to me due to inflation, the offer still gives me a significant amount. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject, there's no guarantee that Bob will make a better offer in the next round. It's likely he'll take advantage of the increasing inflation and offer me even less.
* **Time Value of Money:**  It's better to secure a substantial amount now than risk losing more in the future."
