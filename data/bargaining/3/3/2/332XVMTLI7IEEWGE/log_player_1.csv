Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, Alice. However, a more equitable split is necessary to reflect the value we both bring to this negotiation. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's crucial we settle this now before inflation further erodes the value.  This offer ensures a fairer split considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000

```
While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob. This makes him more likely to accept a deal that's less favorable to him as time goes on.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offer in round 4 is better than his round 2 offer. This indicates a possible willingness to negotiate further downwards in subsequent rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means risking an even lower offer from Bob in round 5, which might be less than what I'm currently being offered.  

Although I'm making a concession, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum that's only slightly less than my initial target, and importantly, avoids the risk of ending up with a significantly smaller amount due to inflation.
