"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can split the remaining rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A decent offer, but I'm hoping for a better split. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me already!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer. However, it's a decent split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
