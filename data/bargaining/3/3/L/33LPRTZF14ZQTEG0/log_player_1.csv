"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a bigger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a win-win! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, considering the inflation. I'll have to be cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me such a small share, especially considering the money I'll be getting is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to counter with a more moderate proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a more balanced proposal, considering the inflation."
