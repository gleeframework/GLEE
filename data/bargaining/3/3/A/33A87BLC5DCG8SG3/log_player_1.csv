"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a third of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60, you can give me 40. It's a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. With the offer of $60, I'll get 60/0.8 = 75 dollars, which is a good deal for me.

I'll accept the offer.
