4500.0,5500.0,Let's be reasonable.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the value of money will decrease in the next round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to compromise further, but a 60/40 split is the best I can offer.  Remember, the value of money keeps decreasing with each round. Let's finalize this before we lose more.",Alice,3,
