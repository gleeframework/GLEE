"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  Let's see if he thinks that's fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer.  While I'm getting more than Bob, the inflation means that my $200,000 is worth less than what I offered him in the first round.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself.  This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince him to accept before the inflation hits us too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my share is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, the inflation is really starting to bite.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's better than getting nothing in the next round with even higher inflation."
