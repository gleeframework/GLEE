"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 60$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively 57$.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
