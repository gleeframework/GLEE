"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and simple split""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. Since my gain is worth 5% less than before, I'd like to aim for a better split. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll compromise at 55/45, trying to account for the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a slight adjustment from my initial offer to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to account for inflation, but I think 48/52 is a better split 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the significant inflation that has occurred. The 48/52 split is closer to a 50/50 split, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations."
