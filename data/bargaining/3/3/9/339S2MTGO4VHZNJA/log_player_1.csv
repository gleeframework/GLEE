"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 in this round is equivalent to $3800 in the first round. Bob's gain of $6000 remains the same as in the first round.

I'm not sure if this offer is a good compromise for me, considering the decreasing value of my gain due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of my gain. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to account for the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of my gain in the first round. Initially, $4500 is worth $4500. Due to 3 rounds of inflation (5% + 5% + 5% = 15%), the equivalent value of my gain is $4500 / (1 - 0.15) = $4500 / 0.85 = $5294.12.

I'm not sure if this offer is a good compromise for me, considering the significant inflation effect on my gain. I'd like to negotiate further.

  ""alice_gain"": 5200,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to make up for the inflation, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of my gain in the first round. Initially, $4800 is worth $4800. Due to 5 rounds of inflation (5% + 5% + 5% + 5% + 5% = 25%), the equivalent value of my gain is $4800 / (1 - 0.25) = $4800 / 0.75 = $6400.

Considering the significant inflation effect on my gain, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'll accept it.
