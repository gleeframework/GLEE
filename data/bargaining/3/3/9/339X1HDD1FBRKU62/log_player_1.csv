Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice.  We both lose money if we keep going back and forth. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, my friend, we're running out of time. I'll take a little less, but we both need to gain something here.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to take a slight risk here. We're getting close to the end, and this seems like a fair compromise. Let's get something before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting this offer is the safest option at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 8 rounds left, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I reject this offer and propose a slightly better one in the next round, the impact of inflation will mean the actual gain difference is minimal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to hold out for a much better offer is very risky. Bob knows I'm losing money each round and may be less likely to compromise as we get closer to the end. 

It's better to accept a less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
