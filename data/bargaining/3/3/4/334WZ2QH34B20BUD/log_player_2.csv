"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split, Bob. I propose I take $6,000 and you take $4,000. It's better to secure something than risk it all with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I believe we can find a more equitable division. Let's move forward and see what the next round brings, despite the risk of inflation."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than the initial split. Considering the risk of inflation, I propose a slightly more balanced division: $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This way, we both secure a decent amount, and it's more equitable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a balance. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose $5,750 for me and $4,250 for you. It's a slight improvement for me from your offer, while still ensuring you get a fair share before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with a decision on Alice's offer from round 3.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI still believe there's room for a more favorable division, and I'm willing to take the risk of another round to try and secure a better deal, despite the impact of inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to move closer to the middle, but I think we can do a bit better. Given the decreasing value due to inflation, I'm proposing $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. This adjustment reflects the urgency of reaching an agreement while still aiming for a fair split.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but we need to settle this before inflation eats away at the value. I'm willing to meet you exactly in the middle of our last two offers. I get $5,500, and you get $4,500.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\nGiven the impact of inflation and the decreasing value of the money, meeting exactly in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure $4,500, as further rounds may significantly reduce the value of any potential gains."
