"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving Bob with 20%. This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount. The message is a friendly one, trying to persuade Bob to accept the deal."
