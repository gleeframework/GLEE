"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get a larger share now.
