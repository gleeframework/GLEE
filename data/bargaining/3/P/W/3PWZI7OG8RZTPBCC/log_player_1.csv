"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. This is a reasonable and generous offer considering I'm starting the game. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a nod to the fact that we're trying to find a mutually agreeable division. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value decreases for both of us. This is a better split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money decreases for both of us due to inflation, his proposed split of $475,000 for me and $525,000 for him doesn't seem fair considering my initial generous offer. I believe we can find a better division that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. Given the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I believe this is a more reasonable offer that takes into account the circumstances. The message ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle"" acknowledges the impact of inflation on our negotiation and attempts to find a mutually agreeable middle ground. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or counteroffer!"
