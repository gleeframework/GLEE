Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. My turn, and inflation is eating away at this deal. I'll take the 55/45 split you just offered, but no less. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
