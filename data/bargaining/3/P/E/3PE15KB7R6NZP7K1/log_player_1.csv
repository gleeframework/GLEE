"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather not accept a 40% gain, as it's worth less than 50% of the original amount. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the decreased value of money. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55, considering the inflation, it's a fair adjustment""
}
