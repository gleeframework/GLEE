"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fairer split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is very fair. Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'd like to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Time to compromise, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to budge, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, Bob's offer seems a bit more reasonable. However, I'm not convinced it's the best I can get. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the current worth of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, but I think I can do better than that!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000$ and keeping 420,000$ for myself, trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'll meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I need to be careful not to accept a deal that's too unfavorable. However, considering the current state of the economy, I think I should accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 300,000$ and call it a day."
