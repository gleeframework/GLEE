"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I'm not going to give you all the money!""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and leaves $4,000 for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a bit more this time. You'll get 4000, which is better than nothing! Let's end this before the money loses even more value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great deal for me! With inflation, the money is losing value, and I'd rather try to negotiate for a better split. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is losing value with each passing round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance. You're getting a smaller share, but it's still a better deal than walking away with nothing!""
}
```"
