Let's see if Bob will accept my generous offer!  I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm willing to give him something to start."

# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
``` 

I'm going to lower my offer a bit to try and incentivize Bob to accept, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 2500

Inflation is really hitting Bob hard, and I'm not sure he'll get a better deal in the next round. I'm taking this offer."
