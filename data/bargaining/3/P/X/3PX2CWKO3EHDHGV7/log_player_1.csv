Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, $600,000, and giving Bob 40%, $400,000. I think this is a fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000
