"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to accept or reject""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small portion of the initial $100, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to accept a smaller amount due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50/50 split because I think I can do better. The inflation has reduced the value of the money, so I'm hoping to get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'll give you a slightly better deal this time""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get the better end of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting desperate, I'll give you a chance to make a better offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger hit, the money is worth significantly less than in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $40, as it's a decent deal considering the reduced value of money due to inflation. I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing even more value."
