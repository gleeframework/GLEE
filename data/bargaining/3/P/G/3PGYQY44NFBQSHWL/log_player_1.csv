"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more careful. Since Bob is proposing a 60-40 split, I'll have to think carefully. I'd rather not take a smaller share than I did initially, but I don't want to reject and risk losing even more value in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
