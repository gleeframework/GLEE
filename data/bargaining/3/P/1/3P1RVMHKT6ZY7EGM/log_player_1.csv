"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation in later rounds. This gives you a good share while also ensuring I have a reasonable chance to get the majority. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
