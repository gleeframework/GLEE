"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will take it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a good one, especially since he's offering me a slightly larger share than I initially offered him. I think I'll accept his offer.
