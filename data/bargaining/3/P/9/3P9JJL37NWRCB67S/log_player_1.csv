"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more aggressive offer, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $300,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $270,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. While it's true that I'm getting a smaller share, I'm also getting a smaller amount of money due to inflation. I'm not sure if it's worth accepting this offer.

For now, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 81% of its original value due to the 10% inflation in each round.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try to find a compromise""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 42% of the original $1,000,000, which is $420,000. This way, I'm getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $250,000 is now worth 64.9% of its original value, which is approximately $161,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the share I'm getting, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. However, I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

For now, I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will stick to his word and we can end the game.
