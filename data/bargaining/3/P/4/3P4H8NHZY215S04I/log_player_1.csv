Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it quickly.  It's a risky strategy, but I figure if I can get the money quickly, I'll lose less to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation is starting to eat away at my potential gains.  It's better to accept a fair split now than risk getting nothing at all later."
