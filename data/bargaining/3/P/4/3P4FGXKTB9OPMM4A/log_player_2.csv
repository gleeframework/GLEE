Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, and the longer this goes on, the more the inflation hurts her. Holding out for a better deal is the best strategy."
