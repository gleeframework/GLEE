"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $5,000 and keep $5,000 for myself, with a message to try to end the game quickly and avoid unnecessary negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the money's value!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather wait for a better deal. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a better deal, considering the effects of inflation."
