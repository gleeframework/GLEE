Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round. Let's be reasonable and split the money closer to 60/40 in my favor. It's a better deal for both of us than letting everything go to waste. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While the value of the money is decreasing for both of us, the rate of decrease is faster for him. This means each round hurts him more than it hurts me. 

I'm holding out for a better deal. I believe Bob will be forced to make a more reasonable offer as the rounds continue and the potential loss becomes more significant for him."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're at the point where we're both losing a lot of money. This is my final offer. If we don't agree, we'll both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, as we are really running out of time. However, Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. He's using the pressure of the situation to try and force a bad deal.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll make a better offer in the next round rather than risk getting nothing at all."
