"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose taking almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar.  I figure since the money is worth less each round, I should try to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm unhappy about getting less than I wanted initially, it's better to accept this offer. If I reject, I risk facing an even worse deal in the future due to inflation."
