# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new values, I'll have to adjust my decision. Since Bob is offering a 50/50 split, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer, considering the inflation. Think carefully!""
}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the new values, I'll have to adjust my decision again. Since Bob is offering a slightly bigger share, I'll think carefully about it.

However, I'm not convinced that $700,000 is a good enough share for me, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly.

Considering the current state of the game, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll aim to get as much as possible while still trying to end the game quickly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A tough decision, but I think this is a fair split. Let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. This is a relatively even split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value."
