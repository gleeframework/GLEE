"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. I'll give you 10% of the total, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, with me taking $900,000 and Bob taking $100,000. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still being generous 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the new inflation rates, the actual amounts are:

My gain: $700,000 (worth 90% of $783,333.33, which is 10% less than $1,000,000)
Bob's gain: $300,000 (worth 80% of $375,000, which is 20% less than $500,000)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, considering I could have gotten more in the first round. But I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me taking $600,000 and Bob taking $400,000. I'm framing it as a compromise, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation rates:

My gain: $550,000 (worth 55.56% of $990,909.09, which is 27.1% less than $1,363,636.36)
Bob's gain: $450,000 (worth 45.45% of $900,000, which is 48.8% less than $1,764,705.88)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, considering the previous offers. However, I'm willing to consider it since it's a compromise. I'll accept this offer.
