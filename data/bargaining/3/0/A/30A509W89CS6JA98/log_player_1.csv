"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% or $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to take a closer look at the numbers. If I accept this offer, I'll get 50% of the remaining value, which is:

$100 * (1 - 0.05) * 0.5 = $47.50

And Bob will get the remaining 50%:

$100 * (1 - 0.05) * 0.5 = $47.50

Hmm... it seems like a fair split, considering the inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
