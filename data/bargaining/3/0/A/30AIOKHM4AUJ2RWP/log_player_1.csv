"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, the actual amounts would be:

* My gain: 80 * 0.9 = 72
* Bob's gain: 20 * 0.9 = 18

So, Bob's offer is actually a 50/50 split, which is a generous offer considering the previous round. I accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
