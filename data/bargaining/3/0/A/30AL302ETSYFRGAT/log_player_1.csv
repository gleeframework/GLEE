"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This is a pretty straightforward 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid going to round 2!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less than last round's offer. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer last round was 55-45, and his gain is worth 5% less now, I'll aim to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here's my offer for round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42
}
```
This way, I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, while still keeping it reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is catching up! Bob's gain is now worth a significant amount less than in the first round. Considering the reduced value of Bob's gain, I'll think about it...
