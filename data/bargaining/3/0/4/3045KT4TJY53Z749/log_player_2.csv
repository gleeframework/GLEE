Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my new offer is slightly more generous than before. Take it before the money loses more value! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts me. However, accepting a bad deal now will leave me with significantly less than I could potentially secure by negotiating further."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. The inflation is eating away at the value. I propose a 50/50 split - a fair and equal deal for both of us.""
}
```
**Reasoning:** 

It's time to push for a more equitable split.  A 50/50 offer is fair and straightforward.  Highlighting the impact of inflation adds urgency and emphasizes the benefit of a quick resolution for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious about the inflation, but I'm not budging that much. This is my most generous offer yet, don't let the money lose more value! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to use my fear of inflation against me. While a 430,000 gain is starting to look more appealing with each passing round, accepting now sets a dangerous precedent. It tells Alice I'm willing to fold under pressure and accept a deal that's still heavily in her favor. It's a gamble, but I need to show some resolve, otherwise, she'll continue to chip away at my potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering a compromise. This split acknowledges the time pressure of the inflation while still giving you a majority share. Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to show some flexibility while still aiming for a reasonable share.  A 48/52 split is a significant concession from the 50/50 offer, signaling to Alice that I'm willing to negotiate. The message emphasizes the shared risk of inflation and frames the offer as a win-win solution to avoid further losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. I'll give you a tiny bit more, but don't think I'm getting soft. This is still a great deal for me. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  

The situation is becoming critical. The inflation has eaten away a significant portion of my potential gain, and accepting Alice's offer now guarantees me *something* rather than risking a complete loss if we run out of rounds. While not ideal, 440,000 is better than nothing, and Alice's condescending tone suggests she's unlikely to budge further."
