"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20 bucks and keep 80 for myself.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly since we're both playing fairly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. Since Bob's offer is to split it evenly, that means I would get $50, which is worth 95% of $80, which is what I was initially hoping to get.

I'll accept Bob's offer to split it evenly:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
