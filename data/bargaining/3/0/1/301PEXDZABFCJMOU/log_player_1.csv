"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to start by being generous and giving Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept in the first round."

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though Bob is offering me half, the inflation means that the money I'm getting is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself, especially with the knowledge that Bob's money is losing value at a lower rate than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm going to reject this offer. Bob's offer is getting worse, and mine is getting much worse due to the inflation. I need to see if I can get a better deal. The situation is getting more critical for me, so I need to fight for a better outcome."

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a desperate attempt. The inflation is crushing me, and I need to secure as much of the remaining value as possible. I'm hoping Bob will see that his offer is becoming less and less appealing with each round, and that he might be willing to accept something closer to my proposal."

```

With only two rounds left, I'm making a final, desperate attempt to secure as much as possible. I'm willing to give Bob a very small amount to try and get him to accept. The inflation is devastating my share, and I need to try to salvage something from this negotiation."

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a very low offer, it's the only chance I have. The inflation has decimated my share, and I have to accept something rather than nothing. The game is almost over, and any more rejection will lead to both of us getting nothing. This is the best outcome I can achieve at this point."
