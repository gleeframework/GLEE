"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to turn the tables on me.

I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 (since my gain is worth 20% less)
* Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67 (since Bob's gain is worth 10% less)

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob such a large share, especially considering he rejected my initial offer. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal.

Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than the initial $10,000, so I'll aim for a higher share to account for the decreased value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go back to the 60/40 split. I'm not sure why we're getting hung up on this. I'm willing to compromise, but I think my initial offer was fair. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to revisit the original 60-40 split.

Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

* My gain: 6000 / 0.5168 (since my gain is worth 48.8% less) ≈ 11600
* Bob's gain: 4000 / 0.7279 (since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less) ≈ 5500

Hmm, it looks like Bob's gain is actually worth more than his initial offer, while my gain is worth more than the original 60-40 split. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal.

Considering the continued inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than the initial $10,000, so I'll aim for an even higher share to account for the decreased value.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the accelerating inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting us both, so let's just split it evenly and end this.  I'm tired of going back and forth. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to end the game with a simple 50-50 split.

Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.323 (since my gain is worth 67.23% less) ≈ 15490
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.596 (since Bob's gain is worth 40.95% less) ≈ 8382

Hmm, it looks like the actual values are still quite different from the nominal values. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It seems the game is getting intense.

Considering the continued inflation, my gain is worth 67.23% less than the initial $10,000, so I'll aim for an even higher share to account for the decreased value.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a tiny share, but I think this is the last chance for a fair deal. After this, I'll walk away.""
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
