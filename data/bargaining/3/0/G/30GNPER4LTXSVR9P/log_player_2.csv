Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast. I'm willing to take a bigger share to end this. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the money is losing value, Alice is steadily increasing her demand.  It's clear she's banking on me caving under the pressure of inflation. However, accepting $4,000 now when I could have potentially gotten a better deal earlier is a bad outcome. I need to hold firm and hope Alice becomes more reasonable in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. The money is losing value with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, it's more important to secure a somewhat reasonable deal than to hold out for a slightly better outcome that might never come.  Offering a 50/50 split is fair and emphasizes how much we're both losing by dragging this out.  It puts the pressure on Alice to accept a reasonable deal before inflation erodes the value any further."
