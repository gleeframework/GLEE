"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can end the game early""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and I'll take 60% for myself, which is $60. My message to Bob is that if he accepts, we can end the game early and avoid any potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but not that big! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth 90% of $60, which is $54. Bob's gain of $30 is now worth 80% of $40, which is $32.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I think I'll take it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
