# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the halfway point with the 12-round limit. The longer this drags on, the less value the money holds, especially for me.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Bob's offer is losing value for him quickly, waiting for a significantly better deal is risky. Each round makes the potential gains smaller.
* **Fairness:** Bob has been consistently aiming for a slightly better deal. This is the first offer where he is proposing a truly equal split. Accepting shows a willingness to compromise and avoid a stalemate."
