"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'll see if he's willing to play fair, knowing the money will be worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. Bob's proposal is incredibly unfair, and while I understand the game is about negotiation, I won't be bullied. I'm confident I can do better in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a decent share. I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to take some money now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to be greedy, but his offer is getting progressively worse. I'm sticking to my strategy of rejecting unfair offers. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer gradually, but still offering Bob a significant share.  I believe this offer is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better to accept something than risk getting nothing at all."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. I'm sticking to my strategy of rejecting unfair offers. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the coming rounds, even with the increasing risk of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still offering Bob a substantial amount. The inflation is starting to become a real factor, but I'm hoping that Bob will realize that it's better to take some money now than risk getting nothing at all."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to being more fair, it's still not acceptable. The inflation is a serious threat, but I'm not going to cave to his unreasonable demands. I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Bob will finally see that it's in his best interest to accept.  The inflation is a major risk now, and it's better to take something than risk losing everything."
