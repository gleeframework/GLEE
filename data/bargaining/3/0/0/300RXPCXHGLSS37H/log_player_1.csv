"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll take the lion's share this round, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, the inflation means that a 500,000 gain is better than the 900,000 gain from the previous round, adjusted for inflation. Accepting this offer is the best choice for me."
