400000.0,600000.0,"I think a 6:4 split is more fair, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. This way, we can both get a good portion of the pie before it shrinks too much.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,I propose an equal division of the remaining funds. This maintains fairness while accounting for the diminishing value of money in future rounds.,Alice,3,
