# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the significant decrease in value for me, I need a better split 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate due to the inflation heavily impacting her potential gains. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm betting she'll be forced to make a much better offer in the next round to avoid losing out even more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and this is as high as I can go.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Desperation:** Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation.  Each round makes the deal significantly worse for her. I'm leveraging this to push my advantage.
* **Slight Concession:** I've moved a little closer to her previous offer to make it seem like I'm negotiating. 
* **Finality:**  The message implies this is my best offer, putting pressure on her to accept before the value diminishes further."
