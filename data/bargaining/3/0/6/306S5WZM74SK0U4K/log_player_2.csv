"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take the bigger share and we can end this quickly. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. Losing 20% of the value in the first round would be a significant loss, so I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nSince I'm trying to get a better deal and considering the inflation, I'll make an offer where I get a bit more than Alice's previous offer, but still trying to be reasonable.\n###\n{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you value this money less than I do.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller cut to end this now, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nReasoning: Given that the money is now worth 36% less for me than in the first round, and Alice's offer has slightly improved from her initial one, I think it's best to accept this offer. The diminishing value of the money for me with each passing round makes holding out for a better deal less attractive. Alice's message also suggests that she is unlikely to make a better offer in future rounds."
