Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very lopsided split. I'm going to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. It's highly unlikely he'll accept, but that's fine. This is my first move, and I want to see how he reacts.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round.  I'm counting on the fact that he'll be more likely to accept something, anything, as the rounds go on and the money's value decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is playing a very risky game. He's basically proposing the exact opposite of what I did in the first round!  I'm going to reject his offer for now.  The inflation is impacting him more than me in this round, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future.  It's a game of patience."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to make a more reasonable offer this time.  I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm offering Bob a significant share as well.  I'm hoping this will entice him to accept before the inflation hits him too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is starting to look more appealing, but I'm still not ready to accept.  The inflation is hitting him hard, but I'm still in a good position. I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get more than 100,000.  There are still many rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than before, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still confident in my position.  This offer is a good compromise that still gives me a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but it's still not quite there.  I'm going to keep holding out. The inflation is really starting to impact him now, and I think he'll cave soon. I'm confident I can get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a larger share again, but I'm still keeping a majority for myself.  The inflation is taking its toll, and I need to start considering accepting something soon.  But I'm not going to give up all my bargaining power yet.  I think this offer is reasonable and fair."
