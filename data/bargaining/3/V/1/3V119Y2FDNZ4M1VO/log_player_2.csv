Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want an even split, but time is working against us both. I'm willing to compromise slightly from my initial offer. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
