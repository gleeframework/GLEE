Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $45 and keep $55 for myself, with a message saying ""Let's be fair"". Waiting for Bob's response..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly, I'm willing to give you a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 10% less, the actual value for me would be 90% of $40, which is $36. Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that benefits me more.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer to Bob. Here it is:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the inflation, so I'm offering Bob less than before to compensate for the decrease in value on my end. Let's see how Bob responds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
