"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to try to maximize my share in the first round, but I'm also aware of the inflation factor. This offer should be attractive enough to Bob, but I'm leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my original offer, I'm still not happy with it. I know the money is losing value, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm taking a more aggressive approach this round. I've reduced my offer significantly, but I believe it's still a fair split considering the inflation factor.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in settling this before we reach a point where the money is worth very little."
