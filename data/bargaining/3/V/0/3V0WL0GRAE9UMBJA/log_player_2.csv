"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money with a 7:3 ratio. This should be fair considering the risk involved. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept such a lopsided offer in the first round. There's a chance I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a more fair starting point.  We can always adjust it later if needed.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's adjust our previous offer. A 65:35 split seems reasonable given the reduced value of money. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation factor is a real concern.  A 65:35 split is better than the 70:30 offered earlier, and at least gives me a decent amount."
