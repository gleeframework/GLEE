"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the message to Bob to consider my proposal and respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 50/50. How about I take 60 and you get 40? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is worth 95% of the original 50, which is 47.

I'm not thrilled with the proposal, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's gain is 20% less than the original 50, it's actually 40, which is exactly what I would get if I accepted the original 50/50 split.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is worth 90.5% of the original amount (95% of 95% = 90.5%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up much. Your turn!""
}
