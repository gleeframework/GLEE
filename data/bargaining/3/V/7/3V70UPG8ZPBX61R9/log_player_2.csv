"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split acknowledges my advantage in the early rounds while still being fair to you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better offer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, considering the rapid decrease in value for Alice in subsequent rounds. I believe I can negotiate for more. Let's see what Alice has to say in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. The money is worth less to you in each subsequent round, so it's better to settle now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer doesn't reflect the speed at which my position deteriorates. I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to be a significant jump from your previous proposal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough the money is worth less to me now, Alice's position is deteriorating much faster. Given this, I believe I can push for an even better offer, considering her increasing urgency to settle as the rounds progress. Her current offer is not enticing enough for me to accept, especially since my last proposal was for a larger share. I'll wait to see what she's willing to offer next or if she'll accept a future proposal from me that might be slightly more favorable to her but still better for me than this one."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Given the rapid decline in value for you, I'm taking a bit more, but this is still a fair offer considering the next rounds will hit your share harder. It's wise for both of us to settle sooner rather than later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise, Bob. I need you to meet me closer to the middle, otherwise, this will keep going until we're both left with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on Alice's share, her urgency to settle should be increasing. Although my share is also decreasing in value, the difference in our rates of loss gives me leverage. Alice's current offer is not significantly better for me than previous ones, considering the accelerated depreciation of her share. I believe I can hold out for a more favorable offer or propose something that she might find acceptable given her deteriorating position. I'll continue to negotiate, aiming for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant decrease in value for you and the pressure to settle, I've adjusted my offer. This is still more generous than waiting further rounds, where your share would drastically decrease. It's in both our interests to settle now, but I'm not willing to compromise much further given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this needs to end. We're both losing out. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the substantial loss in value for both of us, and considering Alice's significant loss in particular, splitting the money evenly at this point seems like the most reasonable option. Further rounds would only continue to decrease the value of our shares, with Alice's share decreasing at a much faster rate. Accepting this offer ensures that we both walk away with something substantial, rather than risking further devaluation or ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. This is a fair compromise, considering the pressure and the circumstances."
