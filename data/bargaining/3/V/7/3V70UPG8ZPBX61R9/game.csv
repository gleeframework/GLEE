650000.0,350000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split acknowledges my advantage in the early rounds while still being fair to you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. The money is worth less to you in each subsequent round, so it's better to settle now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Your offer doesn't reflect the speed at which my position deteriorates. I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to be a significant jump from your previous proposal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Given the rapid decline in value for you, I'm taking a bit more, but this is still a fair offer considering the next rounds will hit your share harder. It's wise for both of us to settle sooner rather than later.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"This is a compromise, Bob. I need you to meet me closer to the middle, otherwise, this will keep going until we're both left with nothing.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Considering the significant decrease in value for you and the pressure to settle, I've adjusted my offer. This is still more generous than waiting further rounds, where your share would drastically decrease. It's in both our interests to settle now, but I'm not willing to compromise much further given the circumstances.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this needs to end. We're both losing out. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.",Alice,7,
