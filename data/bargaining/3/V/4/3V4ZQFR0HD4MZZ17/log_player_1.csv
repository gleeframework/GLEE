Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I don't like the equal split, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer now that the money is worth even less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer to get some money in my pocket.
