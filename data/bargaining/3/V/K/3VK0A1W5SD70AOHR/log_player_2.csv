"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation affects me less. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice.  We can both get a decent amount before the inflation eats away at our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want an even split, but the inflation hurts you more than me. This offer still gives you a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a more even split.  I think Alice can afford to give me a little more, and I'm not in a rush to accept anything less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  How about we split it 4500/5500?  That way we both get a good amount before things get worse.""}
