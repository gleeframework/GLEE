"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, it's only fair since I made the first offer!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money based on the decreasing value due to inflation. Here's my offer: I'll take $47.63, and you'll receive $52.37. 
# Alice gain: 52.37 
# Bob gain: 47.63 
Do you accept this offer?","A clever proposal from Bob!

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's inflation-based proposal is a good deal for me, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
