"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation.

My gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000.
Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself."
