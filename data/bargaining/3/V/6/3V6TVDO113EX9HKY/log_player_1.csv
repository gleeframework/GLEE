Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $999,999 and leave Bob with $1. It's a bold opening move, but I'm confident that Bob will see the logic in this. After all, getting $1 is better than getting nothing, right?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. It's clear Bob is trying to be greedy, but I'm not going to settle for just $1.  We need to find a more reasonable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair, and I believe we can both walk away happy with this outcome."
