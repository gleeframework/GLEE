Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair compromise since we both lost money due to the inflation from the last round. Let's avoid further losses and agree to this! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
