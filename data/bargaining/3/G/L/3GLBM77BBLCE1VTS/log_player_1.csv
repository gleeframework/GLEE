Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can do better than a 50/50 split.  Since we're both taking a risk by waiting, let's both take a slightly larger share.  This way, we can both still get a good amount of money even with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5200
