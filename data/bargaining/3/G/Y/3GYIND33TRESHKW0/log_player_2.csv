"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable for the first round. What do you think?

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Your turn, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?  Inflation is hitting you harder than me, so let's make a deal!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the situation with inflation, Bob, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. How about we meet closer in the middle? This offer accounts for the inflation difference while still being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offer is closer to a reasonable split, she's still aiming for a larger share. Bob can afford to be a bit more patient and see if he can secure a better deal in the next round."

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic.  Time is running out for both of us, especially you.  A 52/48 split is my bottom line this round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't accept such a disadvantageous deal. This offer is my final compromise.  Let's close this out before inflation eats away at the value even more. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. While not ideal, Alice's offer is the best Bob is likely to get at this point.  

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both players, especially Alice. Every round that passes makes the potential gains significantly smaller.
* **Alice's Desperation:** Alice's message implies this is her final offer. If Bob rejects it, her offers in subsequent rounds are likely to be even less favorable, especially as her position weakens with the inflation rate. 
* **Better Than Nothing:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of walking away with nothing if they fail to agree in the remaining rounds."
