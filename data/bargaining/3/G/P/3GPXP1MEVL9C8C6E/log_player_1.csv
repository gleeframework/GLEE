I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob. I figure it's better to get something in the first round and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  Bob is being very greedy, and even though I'd get something, it's a very small amount. I think I can do better by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a more even split. I think he might be more willing to accept something closer to 50/50, especially since he rejected my previous offer and the money is losing value."
