"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll factor that in. In terms of the original $100, Bob is offering me $40, which is equivalent to $44.44 in the original value (100 / 0.9 = 1.1111, then 40 * 1.1111 = 44.44). I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

This is a slightly more aggressive offer than my initial one, but still a reasonable starting point given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the original $100. To do this, I'll divide 1 by 0.7279 (1 - 0.271 = 0.7279), which is the factor by which the money has decreased in value. Then, I'll multiply Bob's offer by this factor to get the original value.

42 * 1 / 0.7279 ≈ 57.63

So, in the original $100, Bob is offering me $42, which is equivalent to $57.63. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the continued inflation, my offer for round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than the previous ones, but still a reasonable compromise given the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 40.95% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the original $100. To do this, I'll divide 1 by 0.5935 (1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905), which is the factor by which the money has decreased in value. Then, I'll multiply Bob's offer by this factor to get the original value.

38 * 1 / 0.5935 ≈ 64.04

So, in the original $100, Bob is offering me $38, which is equivalent to $64.04. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the continued inflation, my offer for round 7 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 49,
  ""bob_gain"": 51
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than the previous ones, but still a reasonable compromise given the decreasing value of the money."
