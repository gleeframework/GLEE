"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

With the new offer, I would be gaining $400,000, which is worth 90% of $450,000 (10% less than the original $500,000 I would have gained in Round 1). This is a good deal for me.

I accept the offer.
