"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm Alice and I want to get the most out of this deal. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about this slightly adjusted split? It accounts for the time lost. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less to me in this round, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or later in the game. Accepting 45% of the money, which is now worth 20% less, doesn't seem like the best option at this point. I'll take my chances and make another proposal in the next round.\n\nYour turn! What's the next step?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's split the difference!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $42, which is slightly less than what I offered in the first round, but still a relatively good deal considering the inflation. The message ""Come on, let's split the difference!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and willingness to find a middle ground. Since the money is worth less to me with each passing round, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not pushing Bob too far.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, how about we split the difference... your way? Time is running out! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth significantly less to me in this round, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer of 42% is lower than my previous offer to him, and I'm not convinced that he's willing to compromise. The fact that he's emphasizing that time is running out suggests that he's trying to pressure me into accepting a less favorable deal. I'll take my chances and make another proposal in the next round.\n\nYour turn! What's the next step?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Getting desperate? Let's compromise!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $45, which is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still a relatively good deal considering the inflation. The message ""Getting desperate? Let's compromise!"" is an attempt to make Bob think that I'm willing to find a middle ground, while also subtly suggesting that he might be getting anxious about the decreasing value of the money. Since the money is worth significantly less to me with each passing round, I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and not pushing Bob too far.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we both lose out if this goes on! 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth significantly less to me in this round, I believe that this is the best deal I can get. Bob's message suggests that he's unwilling to compromise further, and the threat of both of us losing out if the game continues is a strong incentive to accept the offer. Additionally, considering the rapid decrease in value of the money, getting 38% of the original amount is better than risking getting nothing or a worse deal in future rounds. I'll take the offer and end the game here.\n\nGame over!"
