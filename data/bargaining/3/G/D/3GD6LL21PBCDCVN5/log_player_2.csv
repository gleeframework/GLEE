# Bob gain: 4000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with Alice's offer. I think I can get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Since Alice's money is worth 10% less in each round, I'll try to take advantage of that.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""You're losing value, Alice. Take this offer before it's too late!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is shifting, Bob, but I'm still aiming for a fair deal. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Alice's money is losing value, her offer of 5500 is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. Considering this, I think I can still get a better deal. But Alice says it's her final offer, so I need to weigh my options carefully.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer. I think it's the best deal I can get, considering the circumstances."
