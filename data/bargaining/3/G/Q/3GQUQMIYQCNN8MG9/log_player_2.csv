Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's 58-42. Think carefully!

# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, 57-43 is my final 'generous' offer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for Bob due to the 20% inflation per round. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller payout, even if he gets a larger percentage in a future round.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently offered proposals favoring her, and her latest message implies she's unlikely to budge.  

While 43% isn't ideal, it's better to secure this amount now than risk getting a much smaller share in a later round."
