Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Seriously, this is as good as it gets. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best course of action, even though it's a terrible offer. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of Bob's potential earnings has eroded significantly (over 34%). Waiting any longer will only make things worse for Bob.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently offered unfavorable splits, indicating she's likely to push for an even worse deal in the next round.
* **Something is better than nothing:** Taking the $25 now is a loss, but it's better than risking a worse offer and further inflation damage, which might leave Bob with even less in the end."
