"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with the message that we can negotiate further if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy on round 1, now I'll take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was too greedy on the first round!

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth less, and Bob's offer is more generous than mine was initially. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
