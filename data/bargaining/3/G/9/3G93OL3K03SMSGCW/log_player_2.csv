"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Your share is $4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to wait and see if Alice will offer more.  I can get a better deal than an even split with 12 rounds left!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split.  I'm willing to give you $4000, but I'm hoping for a better deal in the future.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split this time. Both of us receive $5000. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I could potentially get more, inflation is a serious issue here. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent amount, and I'm unsure if Alice will be willing to budge further in the next round."
