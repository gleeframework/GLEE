"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I propose to keep 95$ for myself and give Bob 5$. This is a fair starting point, as it is the most I can offer while still getting the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, the 5% inflation makes the money worth less. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me 40$, which is better than the risk of getting nothing if I reject and he ends up keeping everything in the next round."
