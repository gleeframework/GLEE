"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given the changing value of the money.  Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factored in, my gain of $4,500 is worth 5% less than the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's a good deal for me.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
