"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and leaving Bob with $40. I'm hoping this will set a good tone for the rest of the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's try this! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 40-60 split is fair, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing faster for me. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing, I'll aim for a larger share. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me a slightly larger share to account for the decreasing value of money."
