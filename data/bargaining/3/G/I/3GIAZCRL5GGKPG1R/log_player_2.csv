"Round 1

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly.  Inflation is eating into our gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, inflation is hurting you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the deal is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Accept it, or we both lose out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadline pressure:**  We are past the halfway point.  Alice needs to understand I'm serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Strategic concession:** Offering 48/52 is a slight concession that might be enough to get her to agree, but still favors me considering the inflation.
* **Ultimatum:** By framing it as my ""final offer"" I increase the pressure on Alice to accept.  It's risky, but the alternative is potentially getting a much worse deal later, or nothing at all."
