"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That wasn't fair, Alice. Let's be reasonable - I take 6000, you take 4000.  The clock is ticking and the money is losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
