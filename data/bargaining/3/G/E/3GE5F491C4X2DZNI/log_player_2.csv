Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

We're playing a classic game theory scenario here, similar to the Ultimatum Game.  While accepting Alice's offer would be better than nothing, rejecting it sends a strong signal that I'm not going to be pushed into a corner.  There's a chance Alice will panic as we get closer to the final rounds and offer a more substantial amount."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  I'm offering you a very generous 40%.  Don't be foolish - let's both walk away with something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and we need to apply pressure.  This offer is still slanted in my favor, but the 40/60 split presents a strong case for Alice.  It's a substantial amount, and she'll likely regret it if she rejects this and we end up with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. I'm taking 950,000 and giving you 50,000. It's a better deal than nothing. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  

This is a tense moment! Alice is clearly feeling the pressure too. Rejecting this close to the end might seem crazy, but it shows I'm absolutely serious about getting a fair deal. It's a huge gamble, but the potential reward of a better offer in the last round is worth the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's down to the wire. This is my absolute final offer - a 50/50 split.  Don't let's throw away a million dollars because of greed. ""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's the final round, and we need to make a strong, rational move.  A 50/50 split is the epitome of fairness.  There's no room for further negotiation, and Alice would be foolish to reject a guaranteed $500,000. This is our best shot at walking away with anything."
