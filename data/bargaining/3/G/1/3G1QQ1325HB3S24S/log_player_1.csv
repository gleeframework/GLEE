"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer gives me a large share of the money, while still giving Bob a small amount.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a somewhat unequal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation makes my share of the money worth less.  I don't know if Bob will continue to offer this kind of split, so it's better to accept it now."
