"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm trying to make a reasonable offer to get the game started, and I'm framing it as a fair split with a slight bias towards myself since I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I was hoping for a better deal. I was thinking I could get at least 50% of the remaining 100$ since Bob rejected my initial offer. This 70-30 split is too lopsided in Bob's favor. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'll take 50% and you can take 50%""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more balanced offer compared to the previous ones. I'm trying to make a more reasonable offer to get the game back on track."
