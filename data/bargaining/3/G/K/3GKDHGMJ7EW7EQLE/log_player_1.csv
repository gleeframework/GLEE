"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI'll take 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob will get the remaining 40%, which is $400,000. I've also included a message to Bob to try to persuade him to accept my offer. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut is reduced by inflation more than mine, let's be a bit more realistic this time. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'd actually be getting less value than the $550,000 offered. I'll try to make a better proposal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering inflation""}\n\nI'll offer a compromise, taking into account the inflation that affects me more. I'll propose that I take $580,000 and Bob takes $420,000. I've included a message to Bob to try to find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, and every round costs us both. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, with it being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and Bob's message stating this is his final offer, I believe accepting this proposal is the best course of action. The longer we negotiate, the less the money is worth, especially for me. I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure we both get something before the value drops further or we run out of rounds."
