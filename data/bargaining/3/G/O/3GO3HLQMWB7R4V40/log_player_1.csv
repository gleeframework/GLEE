"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose that Alice gets $999,999 and Bob gets $1.  Since the money is worth less to me in the next round, I'm taking almost all of it. Let's see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes it clear that I'm unlikely to get a better deal in the next round.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option."
