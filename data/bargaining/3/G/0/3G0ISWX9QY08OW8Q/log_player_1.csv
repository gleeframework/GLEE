"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 10% less, this offer is quite generous from Bob's perspective.

I'll think for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
