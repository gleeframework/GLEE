"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. This is a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. 

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
