"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10. This is a fair starting point considering I'm taking the risk of Bob rejecting and potentially leading to a worse outcome for both of us in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is unacceptable to me. Even with inflation, losing 80% of the potential gain is not a good deal.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 80, giving Bob 20. This still gives me a significant portion of the money while acknowledging the inflation and giving Bob a chance to gain more than in the previous round.  I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
