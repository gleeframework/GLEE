"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  A fair deal for both of us to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm aiming for a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I'm offering 60/40, a fairer split for me, as the next round will reduce your share significantly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation.  How about 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing.  Alice's offer is decent, and the inflation will only hurt her more in the next round."
