Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 6,000 and Bob 4,000. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation we're facing. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 45-55 split. I was hoping for a better deal considering the initial 60-40 proposal I made. I'd like to keep negotiating to get a better share of the pie."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both 5,000 each. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation and the initial proposal."
