"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This way, we can both get a decent share and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2. The offer is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer because I'd be getting $2,000, which is worth less than what I could get in subsequent rounds. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $8,000, I'll aim to counter with a higher offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for myself. This way, we're both getting a decent share of the money, and I'm trying to nudge Bob towards accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer in the first round to understand the current value. Since Bob's offer in Round 1 was $4,000 and it's worth 27.1% less now, I'll calculate the value of his offer in Round 4:

$4,000 x (1 - 0.271) = $2,828.00

Now, I'll compare this value to Bob's offer in Round 4, which is $7,000. Since $7,000 is more than $2,828.00, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was $7,000, I'll aim to counter with an even higher offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Don't be greedy, let's split it fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800 and keeping $4,200 for myself. This way, we're both getting a decent share of the money, and I'm trying to nudge Bob towards accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to nothing, I'm getting closer to everything! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer in the first round to understand the current value. Since Bob's offer in Round 1 was $4,000 and it's worth 40.95% less now, I'll calculate the value of his offer in Round 6:

$4,000 x (1 - 0.4095) = $2,394.60

Now, I'll compare this value to Bob's offer in Round 6, which is $9,000. Since $9,000 is more than $2,394.60, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was $9,000, I'll aim to counter with an even higher offer. However, I'll also consider the fact that I'm running out of time, and the money is worth less with each passing round. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $6,400 and keeping $3,600 for myself. This way, we're both getting a decent share of the money, and I'm trying to nudge Bob towards accepting the offer before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, I'm running out of patience! 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer in the first round to understand the current value. Since Bob's offer in Round 1 was $4,000 and it's worth 52.17% less now, I'll calculate the value of his offer in Round 8:

$4,000 x (1 - 0.5217) = $1,921.60

Now, I'll compare this value to Bob's offer in Round 8, which is $9,500. Since $9,500 is more than $1,921.60, I'll reject the offer.

However, I'm running out of time and the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll need to make a more aggressive offer in the next round to try and get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a more aggressive offer in Round 9, considering the limited time left and the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $8,000 and keeping $2,000 for myself. This way, I'm leaving room for Bob to take a larger share, but I'm also trying to get a decent amount for myself before the game ends."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really running out of options now! 
# Alice gain: 200 
# Bob gain: 9800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer in the first round to understand the current value. Since Bob's offer in Round 1 was $4,000 and it's worth 61.26% less now, I'll calculate the value of his offer in Round 10:

$4,000 x (1 - 0.6126) = $1,525.44

Now, I'll compare this value to Bob's offer in Round 10, which is $9,800. Since $9,800 is more than $1,525.44, I'll reject the offer.

However, I'm running extremely low on time, and the money is almost worthless at this point. I'll make one final offer in the next round, hoping to get something, anything.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, but I'm not expecting much."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With only one round left, I'll make a desperate offer to try and salvage something. Here's my proposal for Round 11:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""Take it, it's the best I can do!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $9,000 and keeping $1,000 for myself. This way, I'm leaving almost everything to Bob, but I'm trying to get at least something for myself before the game ends."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's now or never, Alice! Take it or get nothing! 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer in the first round to understand the current value. Since Bob's offer in Round 1 was $4,000 and it's worth 68.62% less now, I'll calculate the value of his offer in Round 12:

$4,000 x (1 - 0.6862) = $1,231.48

Now, I'll compare this value to Bob's offer in Round 12, which is $9,900. Since $9,900 is more than $1,231.48, I'll reject the offer.

However, I've run out of time and options. I've made my final decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer from Round 12. Since I've rejected all of Bob's offers, I'll get nothing, and Bob will get everything."
