# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, it's getting late! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, accepting this offer would mean I get even less than in Round 3. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, but I'm willing to gamble a bit longer for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time.  A perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming a major factor now. I need to incentivize Alice to settle quickly. Offering a 50/50 split seems fair and might be my best chance to secure a reasonable amount before inflation eats away at the value further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is working heavily against me. Alice is still trying to take advantage, but if I reject this, the inflation means I'll likely get even less in subsequent rounds.  It's better to secure something now rather than risk ending up with nothing."
