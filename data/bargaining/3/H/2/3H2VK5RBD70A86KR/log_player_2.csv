Let's see what Alice proposes next.  This offer is a bit too lopsided in her favor.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

Let's start with a more equitable split.  I'll take 550,000 and offer Alice 450,000.  This seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too lopsided in her favor, even with inflation.  Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

Let's increase my share a bit, but still offer a decent amount to Alice. I'll aim for 600,000 for myself, and 400,000 for Alice.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing than her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is an even split, and even though the value of my money has decreased due to inflation, this is the best offer I've seen so far. It's time to accept and end this game."
