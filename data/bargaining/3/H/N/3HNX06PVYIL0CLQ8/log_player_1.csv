Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation hits you harder. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. Inflation is a pain, but I think we can both agree that a fair split is best.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I think this is a generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's painful to accept such a low share after the inflation, it's better than getting nothing in the next round. Bob is likely to take the entire amount, knowing I'll be getting nothing after the next round."
