Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. But I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is throwing me a small bone, the inflation is killing my potential gains.  It's time to show I'm serious about getting a better deal, or we both lose.  Holding out a bit longer might make her more willing to negotiate a fairer split as the deadline approaches."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or I'm going to start playing hardball.  The clock is ticking for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You can threaten all you want, but I know the inflation is hurting you more than me 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is absolutely crushing me now. While this offer is far from ideal, rejecting it to play ""hardball"" is too risky. If I reject this, Alice knows I'm desperate and might offer even less in the subsequent rounds. It's better to take a less-than-ideal deal now than risk ending up with nothing."
