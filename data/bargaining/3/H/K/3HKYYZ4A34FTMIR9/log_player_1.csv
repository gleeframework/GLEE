"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money. While I know the value will decrease for me in subsequent rounds, I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that is heavily in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is far from ideal, I'm willing to accept it to avoid the further depreciation of my earnings. Even with the 20% loss, it's better to have some money than to risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
