Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but I still have several rounds left. While the inflation is hurting, accepting an offer below 50% this early is a bad strategy. I need to show some resolve, hoping Alice will start offering better deals as the deadline approaches."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be serious.  50/50. This is fair and avoids further losses for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was too little, too late! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough spot. While the offer is much worse than before, the inflation is really eating into my potential gains. However, Alice's message implies she might be getting desperate and overplaying her hand. There's a risk she calls my bluff, but I'll try holding out for one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Time is running out for both of us. This is a compromise to avoid going home with nothing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, time is on my side! 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much, and the inflation means my position is getting severely weakened with every passing round. Accepting this offer is far from ideal, but holding out any longer risks getting absolutely nothing if Alice remains stubborn."
