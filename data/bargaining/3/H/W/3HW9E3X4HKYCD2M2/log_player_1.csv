"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is actually a good deal for me. I'll accept it.
