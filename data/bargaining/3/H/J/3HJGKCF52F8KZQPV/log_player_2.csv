"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob.  I take 70%, you take 30%. This makes sense considering the faster rate of inflation for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not going to accept a 70/30 split right off the bat. I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be a little more realistic. I'm offering you 450,000, which is still a fair amount considering the inflation differences.  Let's get this settled.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but ultimately unfair given the rapid devaluation of your share.  I'm proposing a compromise: 65% for me, 35% for you. This ensures we both benefit before inflation significantly diminishes the value. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too one-sided. I'm hoping we can find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
