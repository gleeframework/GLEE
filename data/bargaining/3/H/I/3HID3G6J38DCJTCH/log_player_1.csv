"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a high note!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't beat this offer! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my decision-making now.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the current offer, I'd get $40, but its value is actually 80% of the original $50 I would have gotten in Round 1. So, in real terms, I'd be getting $40 * 0.8 = $32.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it and see if I can do better in the next round.
