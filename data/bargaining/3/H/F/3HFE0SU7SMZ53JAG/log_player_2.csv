"Round 1
Alice's offer:

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical, I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you a fair share, but I need a little more to make it worthwhile for me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still like to get more, considering the inflation, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable choice.  It's a decent gain for me and the risk of getting nothing if we continue is too high."
