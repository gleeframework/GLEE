"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a better deal than my initial offer, Bob. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split.  This considers the time pressure from inflation while still being a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
