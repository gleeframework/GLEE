"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which is $6,000, and Bob will receive 40%, which is $4,000. My message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly"". Waiting for Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this more fairly, I'll take a slightly bigger share to account for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, my share is more valuable now""
}
```

I've increased my share to $6,500, considering that the money is worth the same to me, while Bob's share is now $3,500, which may be perceived as less valuable due to the 20% decrease in value for him in each round, and another 20% decrease from the last round. Waiting for Bob's response!"
