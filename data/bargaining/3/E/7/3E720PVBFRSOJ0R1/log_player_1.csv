"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me the larger share but still offering Bob something. I figure it's better to get a small amount now than risk getting nothing later due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me at least 5,000. With inflation, the value of the money will decrease with each round, making it increasingly risky to reject offers."
