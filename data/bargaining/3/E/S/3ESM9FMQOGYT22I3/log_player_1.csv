"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a fair split, and I think it's a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less now, the offer is equivalent to:

* Alice gain: 300,000 / 0.95 = 315,789 (in Round 1 money)
* Bob gain: 700,000 / 0.95 = 736,842 (in Round 1 money)

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since it's a bit more skewed towards Bob's gain. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to try to get a better deal, while still being reasonable and giving Bob a decent share."
