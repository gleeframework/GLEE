"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, and we can reassess and adjust in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with 50/50, but I think I can do better than that. Let's see if you like my offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal!

I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better in future rounds, and I don't want to give up too much of the initial amount. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% toll on the money, I'll make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You tried to take advantage of me in the last round, but I'm not afraid to make a stronger offer. This time, I'll take 60% and leave you with 40%.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you're taking advantage of me, but I'm not afraid to counter. This time, I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not going to give in to 60%. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot!

I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer because, considering the inflation, this is a relatively good deal for me. I'll take the 580,000 and hope that I can do better in future rounds."
