Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has decreased the value of the money I would gain, Bob's offer is still significantly higher than what I would get if we keep rejecting each other. It's better to take what I can get now and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
