"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 

This is my offer for the first round. I'm taking a big chunk for myself, hoping Bob will accept.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm getting a lot less, I'll accept the offer.  It's better than risking getting even less in future rounds due to inflation."
