"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the effects of inflation, my gain of 40 is worth even less than I initially thought. I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This time, I'm aiming for a more balanced split, hoping to avoid any further erosion of value due to inflation."
