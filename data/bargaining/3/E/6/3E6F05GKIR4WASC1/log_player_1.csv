"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping most of the money 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll on my potential gain, I need to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is still keeping a larger share of the money, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% bite out of my potential gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but still keeping a decent chunk of the money for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! My potential gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. Given the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

However, I'm not thrilled with the offer, and I'd like to get a better deal. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but I'm still trying to maximize my own gain. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
