"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets the remaining $20. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, the $50 I would gain is actually equivalent to $47.50 in the original amount.

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best option, especially since Bob's gain is worth 10% less, which is $5 in the original amount. I think I can do better than this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me again, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""You said you deserved a bit more, but I think I'm the one who's been patient so far. This is a fair compromise.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think I should get the majority of the money since I'm the one making the proposals now 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me, the $40 I would gain is actually equivalent to $34.41 in the original amount.

I'm not thrilled about giving up the majority of the money, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value. This offer is a bit more generous than the previous one, and I think it's a decent compromise.
