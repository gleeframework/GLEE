"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a 60-40 split. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'm willing to give you a slight advantage. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $45.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a slightly larger share, considering the inflation.""

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $100 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so it's $72.90.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. The 45-55 split is a bit too close to the original 40-60 split, and I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation. Can you meet me at 50-50?""

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. The 40-60 split is a bit too far in Bob's favor, and I'm not getting a fair deal considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further. Here's my response:

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $100 is now worth 47.83% of its original value, so it's $47.83.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. The 35-65 split is a bit too far in Bob's favor, and I'm not getting a fair deal considering the inflation. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round, which would leave us with even less money. I'd like to accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to negotiate one last time:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to think about it. Can you meet me at 45-55?""
}
```"

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $100 is now worth 38.74% of its original value, so it's $38.74.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not happy with the 30-70 split. It's a very unfavorable deal, and I'm not getting a fair share considering the inflation. I've already rejected several offers, and I don't want to go to the next round, which would leave us with even less money. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, I'll accept your offer. I'm not happy with it, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.""
