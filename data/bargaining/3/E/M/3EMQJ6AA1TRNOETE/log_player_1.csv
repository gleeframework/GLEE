Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly. I'll take 55% and you can have 45%. This way, we both get a good share, and we can avoid further rounds and inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
