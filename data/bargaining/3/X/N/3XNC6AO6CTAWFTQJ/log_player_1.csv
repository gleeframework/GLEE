"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60. Is this acceptable to you, or do you want to proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

My gain of $40 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $38. And your gain of $60 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $48.

I still don't think this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject your offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering you $45, and I'll take $55. Is this acceptable to you, or do you want to proceed to the next round?"
