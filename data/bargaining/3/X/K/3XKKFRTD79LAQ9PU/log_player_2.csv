"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for starting the negotiation. This ensures we both benefit from this deal.

# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I believe my offer is fair and takes into account the value of the next round. Let's split and avoid losing more money to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose out with these delaying tactics. I propose a simple 50/50 split.  It ensures we both walk away with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm happy to accept Alice's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the inflation rate, it's clear that delaying further will only result in both of us losing more value. This offer ensures we both walk away with a significant sum, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable conclusion to the game. Well played, Alice!"
