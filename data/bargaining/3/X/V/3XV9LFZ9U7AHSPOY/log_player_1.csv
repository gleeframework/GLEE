"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can work together to get a better deal later.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money. The message is an attempt to build trust and encourage Bob to consider my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure what's fair, let's try 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
