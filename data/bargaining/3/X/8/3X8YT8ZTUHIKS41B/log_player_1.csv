"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk of inflation. Let's split it 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
