"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing my gain, I need to think carefully. But 3000 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with diminishing returns.
