Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the risk I took by declining your offer and the devaluation of the money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
