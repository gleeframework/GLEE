"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 gain in the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $7,200. And Bob's $2,000 gain is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $1,900.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
