"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my offer in this round is worth less than in the previous round. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to take what I can get.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
