"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, splitting the $1,000,000 equally between us. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave you with 40% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a bigger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 40% of the remaining amount. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give you all the money!""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to negotiate a fair split."
