"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This leaves a substantial portion for Bob, while ensuring a good outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering a 8000/2000 split.  While inflation has hit me hard, I'm still willing to compromise to reach a deal.  This offer reflects a good balance between our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is significantly worse than the 8000/2000 split I proposed in the previous round, even factoring in inflation.  However, it's better than nothing at all.  Accepting is the safest choice considering the rapid devaluation of the money."
