"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This ensures a significant gain for me while still giving Bob something. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and with inflation kicking in, it's a good idea to secure something now rather than risk getting nothing at all."
