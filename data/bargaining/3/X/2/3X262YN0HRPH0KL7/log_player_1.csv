Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still stubbornly mirroring my offers, but he's right that time is running out.  I'll reject this, but my next offer needs to signal that I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is a fair compromise.  Take it or we both risk walking away empty-handed.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with only a few rounds left, I think this is a fair compromise. Let's end this game and take what we can. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're down to the wire. While I'd prefer a larger share, getting 400,000 is far better than getting nothing if Bob continues to mirror me and time runs out. It's too risky to reject this offer now."
