"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively fair split considering we're starting with 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, my gain of 40 dollars is actually equivalent to 32 dollars in the first round.

Considering this, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll need to adjust my proposal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will find it more appealing this time around."
