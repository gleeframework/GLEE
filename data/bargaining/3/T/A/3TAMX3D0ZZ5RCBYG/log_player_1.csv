Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money 5500 to 4500 in your favor, Alice. This is a fair compromise given the inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
