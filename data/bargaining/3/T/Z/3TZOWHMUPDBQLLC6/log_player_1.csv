"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose to take 90% of the money and leave 10% for Bob. This leaves a good amount for Bob, while still ensuring I get the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still leaving a significant portion for Bob.  Given the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I believe this is a fair and reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, the inflation has significantly lowered the value of my potential gains. Accepting this offer will ensure I get at least some money, even if it is a smaller amount than I initially hoped for."
