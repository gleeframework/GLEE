"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining 2 rounds' inflation evenly!""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair share considering the potential inflation that will occur in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, 40% is a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is actually worth 90% of the original $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is a decent deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
