Due to inflation, the money is worth significantly less to me now, and I don't think I can get a better offer from Alice. It's better to accept this offer and get something rather than risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.\n\n###\n\nLet's end the game here and take the 45-55 split.\n\n###\n\nThanks for playing the game with me! If you want to play again or try a different game, just let me know!"
