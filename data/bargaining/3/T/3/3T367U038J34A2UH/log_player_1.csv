"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's discuss further 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $5,400 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. The money is worth less, so I'd rather settle for a smaller amount now than risk getting less in future rounds.
