"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
Bob gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I accept this offer.
