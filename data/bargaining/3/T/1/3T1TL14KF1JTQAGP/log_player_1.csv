Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fairer distribution considering the decreasing value of the money. It also provides a more balanced outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
