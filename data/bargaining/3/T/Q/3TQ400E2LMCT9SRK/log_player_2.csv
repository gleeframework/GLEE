Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I need a larger share.  Let's find a compromise before things get even worse with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with a 30% cut. I think I can get more if I keep negotiating."
