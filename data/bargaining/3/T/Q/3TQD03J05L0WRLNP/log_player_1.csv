"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. This way, we both get a decent share and can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, Alice. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll re-evaluate the offer:

* Alice gain: 50, which is 50% of the current value of the money, which is 90% of the original $100 (due to 10% inflation). So, Alice gain is 50 * 0.9 = $45
* Bob gain: 50, which is 50% of the current value of the money, which is 80% of the original $100 (due to 20% inflation). So, Bob gain is 50 * 0.8 = $40

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
