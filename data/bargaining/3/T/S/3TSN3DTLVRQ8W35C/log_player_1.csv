Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer, hoping to secure the money early and avoid any potential inflation risks.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, and while I'm concerned about inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a huge imbalance. I'm confident I can negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share, but still aiming for a more equitable split. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept, as the potential for further inflation could be a risk for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor, even with the inflation factor.  I'm sticking to my strategy of trying to negotiate a more balanced split. I believe I can still get a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making a small concession, but I'm still aiming for a more balanced split. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept, as the potential for further inflation could be a risk for both of us."
