"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice gets a great deal right off the bat, it's worth it for Bob to hold out for a much fairer split, even with inflation eating away at the total."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That's not how we start a fair negotiation, Alice. How about a more reasonable split? I'll take 60% and you get 40%.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to take 55%, and you get 45%. This should be a fair compromise considering our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob needs to hold firm for a bit longer, even with the increasing inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm willing to meet in the middle - 55% for me, 45% for you. Take it or leave it.""}
