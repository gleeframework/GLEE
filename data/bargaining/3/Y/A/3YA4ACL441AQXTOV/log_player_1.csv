"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share and leaves Bob with a small portion, but it's a good starting point. I'm curious to see if he'll accept it or try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than my first offer, and while it's a significant amount for me, the inflation is making the value of the money drop quickly. I'm going to try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference between my first offer and Bob's offer.  This gives me a decent amount, but also offers Bob a larger share than my first offer. Since we're both losing money with each round, I think it's important to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. While Bob's offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, the inflation is making the value of the money drop quickly.  With each round, the potential gains are shrinking. I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, we might not be able to reach an agreement before the money becomes worthless.  I'm going to take the 4500 and try to make the best of it."
