"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

This is a straightforward proposal where we both get an equal share of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A small advantage, but a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's slightly more aggressive than the first one. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You took a bigger share last round, now it's my turn to take a bit more""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get closer to the middle ground 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to the middle ground, but still slightly favoring himself. I'll consider this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, and we can finalize the division of the $10,000."
