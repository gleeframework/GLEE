"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice. I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I don't think I'm being too generous, but I'll consider Bob's proposal. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'd like to propose a new deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, Bob. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving you a free ride, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think it's a good opportunity to make a move. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $5,000. It's not the best deal, but I'd rather have something than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come."
