"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair offer considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can do better!  I'm not sure I agree with Alice's ""fair"" assessment, given the money is losing value for me."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take 55, and give you 45.  It's a better deal for both of us, as the money will be worth less next round. Let's make a deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for you. I'll offer you 35, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. The money is decreasing rapidly, but I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go down to 45, but I need to get more than 35.  This is a fair split, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Let's reach an agreement before it's too late!""}
