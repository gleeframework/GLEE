"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous offer for me. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm hoping we can reach a more balanced split in later rounds.

# Alice gain: 900000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. Let's be real, the inflation hurts you more than me. I'm proposing a more balanced 60/40 split. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt at a more balanced split, but I still believe in a win-win situation.  This offer acknowledges the inflation but also gives you a larger share.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement this round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation rate Bob faces.  While 450,000 is a reasonable chunk, waiting her out is still the better strategy.  Her offers are likely to improve as the inflation eats into her potential gains faster."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm mirroring your last offer. The difference is, the inflation is hurting you more than it's hurting me.  Time is on my side. What do you say?"" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is affecting us both. Let's be realistic and split this evenly. We both get a decent amount, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm confident I could squeeze more out of Alice, the risk of getting nothing is starting to outweigh the potential reward.  A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the advanced stage of the game and the impact inflation is having."
