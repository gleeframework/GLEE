"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm giving Bob a decent amount while securing the majority for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob is proposing a 90/10 split in *his* favor. While I lost some value due to inflation, the value of his share decreased much more significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but this is a far cry from a fair offer. I'll reject and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering an 80/20 split in my favor this round. This is a compromise that accounts for the inflation, and I'm still offering Bob a decent amount.  Hopefully, he'll be more receptive to this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still pushing for an 80/20 split, this time in his favor. While his share has been significantly impacted by inflation, mine has also decreased.  I'm not willing to accept such an uneven distribution, especially since he rejected my fair offer. I will reject and see if he's willing to come to a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. We've both lost significant value due to inflation, but I'm willing to concede some ground for the sake of reaching an agreement. This is a fair compromise that takes into account our individual losses. Let's see if he's finally ready to reach a deal."
