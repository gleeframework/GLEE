"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair offer considering the future inflation.  Accept it and we can both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This offer is extremely unfair.  Even though Alice's message mentions future inflation, the current deal is heavily in her favor.  I will reject this offer and see if I can get a more equitable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more fairly.  I'm offering you 40% and I'll take 60%. This accounts for the future inflation, and allows us both to get a decent share.""}
