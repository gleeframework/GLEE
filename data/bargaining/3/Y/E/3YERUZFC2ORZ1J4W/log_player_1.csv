Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor, considering the inflation. This is a more balanced counter-offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value of the money is decreasing for both of us.  This is a compromise, slightly better for me but still fair to you. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims the value is decreasing for both of us, that's not entirely accurate.  The value is decreasing *much* faster for me due to the 20% inflation hit each round. Accepting this offer would mean:

* **I get significantly less than half the original value:** 4800 is less than half of 10,000 even before considering inflation. After inflation, it's worth even less.
* **Bob is consistently aiming for slightly above half:**  He's showing a pattern of trying to secure a small advantage each round.

I need to hold out for a better deal that reflects the decreasing value of the money for me."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""The inflation is significantly impacting my share. I'm willing to accept a smaller portion of the actual money, but I need a larger portion upfront to compensate for the devaluation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterating the impact of inflation:**  It's crucial to keep reminding Bob that the situation is not equal. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  By stating I'm willing to accept a smaller portion of the *actual* value, I signal a willingness to compromise. 
* **Sticking to a stronger position:**  While the previous offer of 5500 for me was closer to Bob's offers, I need to aim higher to offset the rapid inflation.  This offer still represents a significant concession on the final value I receive."
