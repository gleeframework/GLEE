Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to improve my chances by offering a bit more to myself. But I'll keep it reasonable to see if Alice will accept.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting! Okay, I'll think carefully about Alice's new offer.

Since the money is worth 36% less, my gain of 450,000 is actually equivalent to 600,000 in the first round, which is a decent offer. But I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to take advantage of Alice's previous offer and make a counter-offer. Since my gain is worth 36% less, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage.
