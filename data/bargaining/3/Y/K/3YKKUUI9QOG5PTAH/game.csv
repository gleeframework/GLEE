45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. The money is worth less with each passing round, and it's getting riskier for both of us. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need at least 55 to make this worthwhile. We're both better off accepting this offer than continuing to risk getting nothing at all.",Bob,4,
