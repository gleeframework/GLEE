"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to play this game strategically.  While a 50/50 split seems fair, there's a lot of time left in the game. I'm going to try to get a better deal by seeing if I can push Alice to accept a slightly more favorable split in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hey Alice, I'm happy to offer you a fair deal, but I'm going to need a little more this time. Let's start with 60 for me and 40 for you. We can work something out in the next round if you aren't happy with that.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, Bob, but 60 for you is a bit too much. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?  We can work something out in the next round if you're still not happy. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. I want to try to get more than 45, and I'm confident I can based on the changing inflation rates.  I'm willing to gamble and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The money is worth less with each passing round, and it's getting riskier for both of us. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need at least 55 to make this worthwhile. We're both better off accepting this offer than continuing to risk getting nothing at all.""}
