Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The money is worth less with each passing round, and it's getting riskier for both of us. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need at least 55 to make this worthwhile. We're both better off accepting this offer than continuing to risk getting nothing at all.
