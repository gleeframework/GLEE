"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to see if he's willing to accept quickly, or if he'll try to get more. I'm hoping the inflation will work in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob than he offered me, but I'm still keeping the majority. I'm hoping that the continued inflation will make him more willing to accept a deal closer to my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still not ideal, but with the inflation hitting him harder, it's likely he'll offer even less in the next round. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game before things get worse."
