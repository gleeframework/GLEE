Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, and Bob is feeling the sting of inflation, accepting a deal where he consistently gets less than 40% of the original amount is setting a bad precedent. Alice is clearly using the inflation factor to her advantage, but Bob needs to hold out for a better offer. 

It's a risky move, but waiting might force Alice to propose a more favorable split as the rounds progress and the threat of getting nothing looms larger for both of them."
