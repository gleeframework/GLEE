I'm going for a very aggressive opening offer!  I figure if Bob is even remotely reasonable, he'll accept this.  It's almost all the money for me, but I'm willing to give him a single dollar just so we can get this over with.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I'm unhappy with this offer, it's a significant improvement over the last round. It seems Bob is willing to negotiate. Accepting this means I get 200,000 dollars, which is better than nothing.  Plus, with inflation, the amount he's getting is going down! It's in my best interest to accept this now and get something."
