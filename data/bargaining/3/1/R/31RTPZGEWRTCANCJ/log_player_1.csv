"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $200,000, and I'll take $800,000. We can negotiate further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and taking $800,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation risk, I propose a split of $450000 for me and $550000 for you. This aims to balance fairness and the potential decrease in value over the remaining rounds. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation risk, I'd rather not take a smaller share now. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 50-45 split. I'd like to propose a revised offer: $650000 for me and $350000 for you. Let's see if we can find a better balance.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate in mind, I'll aim to take a larger share now to compensate for the potential decrease in value later. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation risk, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share now. $700,000 for me and $300,000 for you seems like a fair compromise.""
}
```"
