"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm proposing.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I think I should get a bit more since I'm proposing this time.""}\n\n###\n\nSince it's my turn to propose, I'll make an offer where I get 52 dollars and Alice gets 48 dollars. I've also included a message explaining my reasoning. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real - this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice is offering a 50/50 split and considering the effect of inflation, I think it's a fair deal and will accept her offer to end the game."
