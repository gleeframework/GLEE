Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer. However, considering the inflation, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor this time.  Let's close the deal and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. Your offer doesn't account for the inflation we're both facing. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a compromise, and it's better to settle now before the money loses more value.""
