"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer deal considering the declining value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing quickly!

I'll think about it... After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I think I can do better than this. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. This is my final offer for now.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
