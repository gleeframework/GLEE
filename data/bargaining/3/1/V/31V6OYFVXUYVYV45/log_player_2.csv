"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the money is worth less to Alice in each round, so I can likely get a better deal for myself by waiting and making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer deal considering the declining value of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I could get by waiting. The money is worth less each round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll take it."
