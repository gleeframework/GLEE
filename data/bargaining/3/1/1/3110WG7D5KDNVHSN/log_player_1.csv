"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less in the second round, and another 10% less in the third round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself."
