40.0,60.0,I think it's fair that we split the money evenly since you took a larger share last round. Let's try 60/40 this time.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Let's be reasonable. I'll take 55, you take 45. This ensures we both get a good share, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation.  Let's end this here and both get a decent share.,Bob,4,
