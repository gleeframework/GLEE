"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the value of the offer in terms of the original $10,000.

Bob's offer is for me to get $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. That's a pretty big chunk of the pie. I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

On the other hand, Bob is offering himself $6,000, which is 60% of the original $10,000. That's a pretty big chunk of the pie too.

I'll have to think about this one... Ah, I've decided!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too greedy, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more appealing to me.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much, let's find a sweet spot!""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,500, which is 45% of the original $10,000. This is a slightly more generous offer than Bob's previous one, and I hope it will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting even more aggressive!

Let me think about this... Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the offer in terms of the original $10,000.

Bob's offer is for me to get $3,500, which is 35% of the original $10,000. That's a pretty low offer, and I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

On the other hand, Bob is offering himself $6,500, which is 65% of the original $10,000. That's a huge chunk of the pie!

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll have to think about it... Ah, I've decided!

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Bob's offer was a bit too greedy, so I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more appealing to me.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's time to wrap this up!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will finally accept it."
