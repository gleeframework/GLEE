"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves me with a significant share, reflecting the fact that the money devalues faster for you in upcoming rounds. Let's settle this quickly and avoid losing out. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's crucial to consider the declining value of the money. Holding out for a few more rounds might yield a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more evenly.  I understand the value decreases faster for me, but a fair deal benefits us both in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of a more even split, but time is literally money for us.  I'm proposing a compromise. This offer still considers the devaluation and is better for you than waiting longer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, the devaluation of the money is a significant factor.  Alice's offer is more generous than the initial round and the value is continuing to decrease. It's best to secure a deal before the value diminishes even further."
