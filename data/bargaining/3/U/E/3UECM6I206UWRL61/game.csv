7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to share the funds while giving Alice a slight advantage.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection and inflation. Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Considering inflation and Bob's previous proposal, I suggest a 55/45 split. This maintains a reasonable balance, giving Alice a slight advantage but also compensating Bob for potential risks.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
