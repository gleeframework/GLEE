"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the game going on for too long!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

I'll reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable deal for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the value of money decreasing further.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
