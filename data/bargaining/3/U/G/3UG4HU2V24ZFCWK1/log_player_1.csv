"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a straightforward and fair proposal. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
