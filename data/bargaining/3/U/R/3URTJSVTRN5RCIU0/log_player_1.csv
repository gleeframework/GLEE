"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 52/48 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% less from the first round and 5% less from the second round), I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 19.26% less for Bob (5% less from the first round, 5% less from the second round, and 9.26% less from the third round), and the same for me, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 495000,
  ""bob_gain"": 505000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll take the deal this time. It's getting increasingly difficult to get a better offer with the money losing value due to inflation."
