"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation""
}

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, considering that with each passing round, the money is worth less for him due to inflation. I believe this is a reasonable and fair offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I think this is fair 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous""
}

I'm making a slightly more generous offer this time, but still taking into account that the money is worth less for Bob with each passing round. Let's see if he accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating my share, need a bit more 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is on your side, not mine to worry""
}

I'm making a similar offer to my previous one, as I still have the upper hand in terms of inflation. I'm not feeling pressured to give in to Bob's demands, so I'll stick with a slightly favorable offer for myself."
