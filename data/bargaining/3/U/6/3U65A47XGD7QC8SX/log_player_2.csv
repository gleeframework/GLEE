"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with a 99.9999% split, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a dollar to show you're not completely left out. Think of it as a good faith gesture. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though a dollar is something, the inflation will make it worth less in the following rounds, and I can likely get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you 10% of the money, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we can both get a good chunk of the money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 90/10. I'm still getting the bigger share, but you get a significant amount.  This is a much better deal than your offer.  We both come out ahead with this one. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still betting on my ability to negotiate a better deal.  Even though this is a significant improvement from Alice's first offer, the inflation is working against me, and I can probably get closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
