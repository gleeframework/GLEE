"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I'm losing value with each round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is taking a toll, and I need to be more aggressive in my offer to counteract the loss of value. Here's my next proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm trying to get a bit more than 50% to make up for the inflation."
