"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose to take 990,000 dollars and give Bob 10,000 dollars.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 950,000, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. The risk of further inflation is high, and I want to secure a good outcome before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than his previous offer, it's still not a fair deal considering the inflation impact on me. I need to hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 850,000, but I'm still taking a sizable portion. The risk of inflation continues to increase, and I need to secure a good deal quickly. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of settling before things get worse."
