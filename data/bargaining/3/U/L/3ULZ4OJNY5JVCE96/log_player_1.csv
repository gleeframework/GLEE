"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent share for you 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite one-sided, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You took a big chunk last round, now it's my turn to balance it out!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, trying to take back some of the ground Bob gained in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent chunk for you, considering the last two rounds 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his strategy of taking the majority, but I'll try to push back a bit.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30-70 split, and I'd like to keep negotiating to try to get a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A fair split is better for both of us!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and propose a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finally reach an agreement."
