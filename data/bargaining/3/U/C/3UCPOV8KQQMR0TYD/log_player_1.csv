I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a pretty generous offer for the first round. Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to take the $500,000 now, even with the 20% inflation. It's still a significant amount, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the next round."
