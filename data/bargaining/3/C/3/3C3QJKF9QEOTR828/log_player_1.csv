"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk of the money! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 70% of $100 * 0.95 = $66.50
* Bob's gain: 30% of $100 * 0.95 = $29.50

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob! Equal split this time.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
