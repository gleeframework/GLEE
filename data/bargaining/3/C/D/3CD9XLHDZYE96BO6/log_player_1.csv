"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not going to get ripped off!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount. This way, I'll get $8,000, which is 80% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  I'm willing to split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a good share and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best decision for me. I'd rather try to get a bit more, considering the inflation will continue to erode my gains.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation is still eating away at my potential gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle and we can end this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's compromise. I'll give you a slight advantage, but we can both get a better share than we would if we keep rejecting each other's offers. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now! My potential gain is decreasing rapidly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm starting to think that it's better to accept this compromise, even if it's not ideal. The inflation is eating away at my gains, and I'd rather get something than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
