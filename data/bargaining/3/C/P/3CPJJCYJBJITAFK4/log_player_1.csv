"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering the significant drop in value of my potential gain, I'll think carefully about this offer. However, I still want to maximize my share, so I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! I need to be more aggressive to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a significant concession from my previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."
