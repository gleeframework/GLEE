"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40% of the total amount, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, let's flip the script! 60-40 for me this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. I think I can do better than that!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to go all the way to 60-40. You can't have all the fun!""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the total amount, which is $550,000, and Bob gets 45% of the total amount, which is $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference, 55-45.  It's fair and we can move on to bigger and better things. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept the 55-45 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than going back and forth forever. Plus, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal from Bob at this point."
