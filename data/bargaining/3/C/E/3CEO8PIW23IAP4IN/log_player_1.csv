# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to think strategically.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'll aim to get a better deal.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the offers so far, I'm starting to feel like I'm being squeezed. However, I still want to try to get a better deal. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'll consider it.
