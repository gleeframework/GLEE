"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, you'll lose value each round 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal where I get less than half the money. Even with the inflation, there's no reason I should settle for 4000 right away. Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  This way, we both get a fair share, and we avoid any risk of losing money due to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering you'll lose even more value if we don't agree 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not going to accept a deal where I get less than half the money. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to concede a little, but I need to get at least 4500 to make this worth it.  Let's find a compromise before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, let's settle before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not going to accept this offer.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm not going to give up that much money just because of some perceived urgency.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can find a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'm making a final offer.  I'm losing value rapidly, but I'm still willing to give you a significant share. Let's agree before we both end up with nothing.""}
