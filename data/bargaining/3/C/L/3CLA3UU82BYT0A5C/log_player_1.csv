"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
This is a relatively generous offer, considering that I'll be getting the majority of the money, but it's still a reasonable split considering we're just starting the game. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll need to reassess the offer.

Considering the decreased value of the money, I think I can do better than 60. Here's my response:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth even less than before. Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```
I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, taking a bit more for myself while still leaving Bob with a decent share. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more aggressive now!

Considering the significant decrease in value of the money, I think a 50-50 split is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
