"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering future losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand your point about future losses, but I think this split is more reflective of our positions. I'm open to negotiating further.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her due to the inflation mechanic. Accepting would have put Bob at a significant disadvantage. 
* **Bob's counter-offer:**
    * Bob is aiming for a slightly advantageous split (55/45) to compensate for the future devaluation of his potential winnings.
    * The message aims to be firm yet open to continued negotiation, showing Bob is serious but willing to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value, let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both players. While not ideal, accepting now avoids further losses.
* **Improved offer:** Alice has moved closer to a more balanced split, recognizing the impact of inflation on both sides. 
* **Risk of further rejection:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. Rejecting this offer could lead to even less favorable outcomes as the money continues to devalue."
