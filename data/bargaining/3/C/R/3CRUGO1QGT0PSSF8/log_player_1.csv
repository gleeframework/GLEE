"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a 60-40 split. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a better compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 95% of $60, which is $57.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
