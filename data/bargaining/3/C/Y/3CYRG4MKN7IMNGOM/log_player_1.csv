"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, my gain of 6000 in the first round is now equivalent to 6000 / 1.05 = 5714.29 in this round. 

Bob's gain of 4000 in the first round is now equivalent to 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 in this round.

Considering the new values, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original proposal, and it's also a 50-50 split. I'll accept this offer.
