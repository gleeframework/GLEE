"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount. This way, I get the majority, but it's still a decent offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 70/30 split. Let's be a little more even this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $400,000 x 0.9 = $360,000
* Bob's gain: $600,000 x 0.9 = $540,000

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a bit more even than the first one. I'll accept it.
