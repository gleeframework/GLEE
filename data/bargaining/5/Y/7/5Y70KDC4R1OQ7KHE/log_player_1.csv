"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to see if he'll accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decrease in value, I propose we split the funds with a slight imbalance in favor of efficiency. I'll take $6,250 and Alice, you'll receive $3,750. 
# Alice gain: 3750 
# Bob gain: 6250 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decrease in value due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is still relatively close to the initial amount, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up $1,250 more than I would in the first round. Let's see if we can do better.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending the message to see if he'll make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation kicking in, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm offering you $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. It's a fair split considering the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share of the remaining amount, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
