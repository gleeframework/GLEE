Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Let me know when Bob responds! I'm eager to see if he accepts or wants to propose something different."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let Bob know that I appreciate the offer, but it's not in my best interest right now. I'm confident we can find a better solution in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I'm feeling a bit squeezed by the inflation, so I propose a slight adjustment for a win-win.""
}
``` 

Let's see if Bob finds this agreeable. I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a decent share while making it appealing enough for him to accept."
