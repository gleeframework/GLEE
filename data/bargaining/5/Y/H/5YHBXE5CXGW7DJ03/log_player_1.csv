"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider that my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, which means my gain of 300,000 is actually equivalent to 282,353.55 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I think I can do better than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
