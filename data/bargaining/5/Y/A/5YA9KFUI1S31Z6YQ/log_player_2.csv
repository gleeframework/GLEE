"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself. Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly since we both have to agree on a deal. Let's be fair and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm losing value with each round. 55/45 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's getting riskier with each round, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal later on.  Let's take the 45 and call it a day."
