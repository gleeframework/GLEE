Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's more than fair considering the inflation.  Take it, or we both risk leaving with nothing. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is quickly reducing my potential gains.  Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we continue to disagree."
