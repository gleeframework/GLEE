"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 3:1 is too extreme. This 3:2 ratio still takes into account the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
