"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we can proceed to the next round if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value. My gain of $3000 is equivalent to $3000 / 0.9 = $3333.33 in the first round's value.

However, Bob's gain of $7000 is still worth $7000 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount of value. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my offer will be worth 10% less than in the previous round as well.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a bit more than in the previous round, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my gain in the first round. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $2000 is equivalent to $2000 / 0.7189 = $2785.45 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount of value. However, I'm starting to get a bit desperate, and this offer is better than the previous one.

I'll accept it.
