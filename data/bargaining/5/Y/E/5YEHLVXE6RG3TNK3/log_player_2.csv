"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's not a great start. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split it 55/45 in my favor, but I won't go lower.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the circumstances. Accepting now avoids the risk of further inflation eroding the value, and guarantees a significant sum."
