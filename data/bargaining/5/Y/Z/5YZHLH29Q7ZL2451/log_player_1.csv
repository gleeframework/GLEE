"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I propose to take 6000$ and give 4000$ to Bob. This feels like a fair starting point, as it gives me a majority share while still allowing Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose an even split of 5000$ each. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, and the money is depreciating, an even split seems like the most sensible option to ensure we both get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a 50/50 split, the money is depreciating rapidly.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least something, whereas rejecting it risks ending up with nothing if we reach the final round."
