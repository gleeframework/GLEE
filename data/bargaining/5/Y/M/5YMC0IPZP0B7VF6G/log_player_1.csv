"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable and generous offer. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game here. The message is short and to the point, emphasizing the fairness of the split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is worth less each round. Let's be reasonable, I'll take a slight hit to end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept Bob's offer. Although he's trying to appear reasonable by framing it as taking a ""slight hit,"" the offer is actually quite skewed in his favor. With inflation reducing the value of my share by 20% each round, I need to be mindful of the real value of what I'm getting. Given that the original amount was $10,000 and considering the impact of inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in subsequent rounds or make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me. Let's proceed and see how the game unfolds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a balance that considers the impact of inflation on my share while still making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept. Given that my share is worth 20% less each round, I need to adjust the amounts accordingly to maintain a fair value. Let's see how Bob responds to this offer.\n{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for both of us.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - it's better than what you'll get in round 5. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Although I've been trying to negotiate for a better deal, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share (it's now worth 48.8% less than in the first round), I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The longer we continue, the less valuable my share becomes, and Bob's offer of a 55-45 split is relatively fair given the circumstances. It's also worth noting that Bob has framed this as his ""final offer,"" which suggests he might not be willing to compromise further. To avoid ending up with an even worse deal due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's conclude the game here!"
