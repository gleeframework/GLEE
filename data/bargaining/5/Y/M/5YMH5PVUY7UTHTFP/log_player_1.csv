Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to see if he'll take it. I'm hoping to secure most of the money in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, I'm not sure I can do better. Bob is offering a 50/50 split, and with the inflation factor, I might not get a better deal if I reject."
