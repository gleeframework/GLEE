I'm offering Bob 2000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 8000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less in this round, I'm looking for a better deal. Bob's offer is not bad, but I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and make a new one.
