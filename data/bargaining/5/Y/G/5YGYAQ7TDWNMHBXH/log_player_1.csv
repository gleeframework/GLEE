"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable proposal""}

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected 60/40, so I'll try for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20/80 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than before, I'm not as concerned about the absolute numbers as I was in the first round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
