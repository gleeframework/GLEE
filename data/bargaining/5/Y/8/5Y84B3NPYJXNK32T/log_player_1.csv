"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $60 is now worth 80% of its original value.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather have a higher percentage of the original value. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the next round, my gain is worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%), and Bob's gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%).

Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
