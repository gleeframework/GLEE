Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game finished quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is fairer than my first offer, but I'm not willing to settle for 50/50 just yet.  I want to see if I can still get a better deal, especially since the value of his money is decreasing faster.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share than my first offer, but still more than he got from his proposal.  This might be enough to convince him to accept, especially with the added inflation on his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse for me, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  His money is losing value much faster than mine, and I'm not going to cave in yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35} 
```

I'm going to try offering Bob a slightly smaller share again. The inflation is really hitting his side hard, and this might be a good time for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hitting Bob hard, this offer is too bad for me to accept. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, especially with only a few rounds remaining.  I need to hold out for a more fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to stick with a similar offer to the previous round,  but with a slightly higher share for me. I'm hoping that the pressure of the shrinking rounds will finally convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer for me. I will not accept it.  While Bob's money is worth a lot less, I'm still holding out for a more even split.   I think with only a few rounds left, he will be forced to make a more reasonable offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going to try a slightly lower offer than my previous one.  This might be a good compromise for Bob, especially with the continued inflation on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is absolutely terrible for me. While I know the inflation is heavily impacting Bob, I still refuse to accept such an unfair split.  I'm going to hold out for a more reasonable offer, even if it means risking getting nothing.  I'm hoping that with only a few rounds remaining, Bob will realize he needs to make a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  This is the fairest offer I can make, considering the pressure of the shrinking rounds and the heavy inflation on Bob's side. I hope he realizes that this is the best deal he can get before we both get nothing!"
