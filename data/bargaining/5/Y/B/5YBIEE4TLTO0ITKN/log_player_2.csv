Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my previous offer is now worth less than your last one. Time is ticking, so I propose a new split that factors in the inflation. This is a fair deal considering we both lose if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that the value of her previous offer has decreased, she's still aiming for a significantly larger share. My offer in Round 2 was a genuine attempt at a fair compromise. By rejecting it and offering a slightly better deal that still heavily favors her, she's demonstrating a reluctance to negotiate fairly. 

It's a risky move, but I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose, but accepting a bad deal sets a bad precedent for future rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose with each round. I'm willing to settle for a slight advantage to you, recognizing the inflation impact is greater on your end. Let's be pragmatic and close this deal."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** I'm adjusting my ask slightly downwards to show I'm willing to compromise and meet Alice closer to the middle. 
* **Highlighting the time pressure:**  It's crucial to remind Alice that every round costs us both money. 
* **Emphasizing pragmatism:** I want to frame this as a practical decision.  Getting a deal, even if not perfect, is better than getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the inflation is significantly impacting me.  This offer is a compromise, slightly favoring me to offset the losses we're both incurring. Let's be reasonable and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I have to prioritize getting a deal at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.
* **Alice's Offer:** While still favoring her, Alice's offer is closer to my Round 4 proposal.  It shows she's somewhat willing to meet me closer to the middle ground.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds carries a significant risk of getting nothing at all. 

It's not ideal, but accepting this offer guarantees me something, which is better than the increasing likelihood of walking away empty-handed."
