"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $100 and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Fairness is important to me. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50.

I'm not sure if Bob is considering the inflation, but I'll assume he's not. In that case, his offer is a 50:50 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
