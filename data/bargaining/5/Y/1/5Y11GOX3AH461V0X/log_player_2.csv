"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's risky to accept such an uneven split right away. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 60/40. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation risk. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, Bob. I'm willing to go down to 70% for me, but this is my final offer.  Let's get this done before things get even more volatile. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and the inflation risk is increasing with each round. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to secure at least some gain."
