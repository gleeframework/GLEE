"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob 40% of the total amount. This way, we both get a significant share, and it's a relatively fair split. Since there's no inflation for Bob, he might be inclined to accept this offer. However, since I'm the one experiencing inflation, I want to try to get as much as I can early on. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation will affect Alice more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince I'm experiencing a 5% decrease in value each round, I want to try to get as much as I can, and 450,000 is less than what I initially offered Bob. I'll take the risk and reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that benefits me more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a middle ground. Since Bob offered me 450,000, I'll increase my share to 580,000, which is closer to my initial offer. This way, I'm taking into account the inflation that affects me, while still attempting to be reasonable and hoping Bob will accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, since we both lose money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the inflation, accepting the 500,000 offer seems like the best option. The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and this offer is closer to the middle ground I was trying to achieve. If I reject this offer, the next rounds will only decrease the value of my potential gain, making it less likely that I'll get a better deal. Accepting now ensures I get a significant share before the value decreases further."
