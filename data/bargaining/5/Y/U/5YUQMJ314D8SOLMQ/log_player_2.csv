"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $3000, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Rejecting allows me to propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to try to get a bigger share, but I still want to make sure Alice gets something, as she might reject this offer and leave us both with nothing in the end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's less than I was hoping for, I'm willing to accept this offer. The inflation is starting to take its toll, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the future.  It's better to get something now than risk getting nothing."
