"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be fair and split the money almost evenly. This offer benefits both of us.""
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Understanding the Game:** The key is that the money loses value for me (Alice) over time. The longer the game goes on, the less my share is actually worth. Bob, on the other hand, doesn't experience any loss.
* **Balancing Fairness and Urgency:**  While I want a larger share, I need to make an offer tempting enough for Bob to accept quickly.  A near-even split incentivizes him to settle now rather than risk getting a slightly better deal later (which would be worth less to me due to inflation). 
* **Future Rounds:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to propose something even more appealing to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair deal. Considering the inflation, this offer will be more beneficial in the long run for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is designed to sound generous while actually taking advantage of my situation. He's correct that considering inflation, waiting would be beneficial for him. However, his offer still gives him a significantly larger share.  

While I need to act quickly due to inflation, I'm not desperate enough to accept a deal where I get significantly less. I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair and simple solution. Let's split the money evenly and end this negotiation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** The value of the money is decreasing for me with each round. While I rejected Bob's offer in Round 2, I need to act quickly before my position weakens further.
* **Strong Position:** By offering a 50/50 split, I'm holding my ground and demonstrating that I won't be pressured into an unfair deal.  This is a strong negotiating tactic, especially since Bob knows time is on his side.
* **Clear Message:** The message is direct and emphasizes the fairness of an even split. This leaves Bob with little room to argue and might push him to accept."
