Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be fair, this is more realistic. It's declining fast! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's not be greedy. This is my final offer!""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's almost worthless! Let's just split it down the middle before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting too risky now. While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting an even worse offer in the next round when the money will be worth even less."
