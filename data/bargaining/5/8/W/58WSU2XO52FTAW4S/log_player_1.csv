"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10 to start. You can propose a better deal if you want!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90-10 split is fair, but this time in my favor. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to flip the script on me!

I'll have to be careful, since the money is worth 10% less for me now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I want to give Bob 90% of the remaining money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing for me. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This 75-25 split should be more to your liking, Bob.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also preparing for the possibility that he might reject it and try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 75-25 split, but this time I'll get the bigger share. It's a fair compromise, right? 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is really losing value quickly for me! Okay, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give Bob 75% of the remaining money, even if it's a ""fair compromise"". I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but I know I need to be realistic about the value of the money decreasing so quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less for me now, so I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. This 60-40 split is my best offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also preparing for the possibility that he'll try to negotiate further or make a counteroffer."
