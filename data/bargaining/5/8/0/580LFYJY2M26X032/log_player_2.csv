Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation affects us differently. However, I need you to meet me closer to my initial offer for this to make sense. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll take the offer since it's Alice's final offer and considering the inflation, it might be the best deal I can get."
