"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground, but this needs to be a fair deal for both of us. Time is money, but so is fairness. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most strategically sound decision for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. Every round that passes makes her more desperate for a deal, which works in Bob's favor. However, it also means Bob's potential earnings are also shrinking.

* **Shifting Offer:** Alice's offer has shifted more towards the middle ground, indicating a willingness to compromise.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks Alice making an even lower offer in the next round. While Bob might be able to secure a slightly larger share by pushing further, the difference is likely to be minimal compared to the risk of ending up with even less if the negotiations completely fall apart. 

By accepting, Bob secures a respectable $450,000, which, while less than his initial target, is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
