Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. This is a 55/45 split, which is closer to a true 50/50 split after the inflation hits.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
