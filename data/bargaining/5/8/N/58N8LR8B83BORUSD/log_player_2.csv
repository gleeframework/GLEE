"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
Even though the offer is extremely unfair, it's better to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round.  There's a chance she might be willing to compromise to avoid losing more money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering a fair split, considering the inflation.  Accept this and we both walk away with something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that. This is my last offer before the next round of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is offering a much better deal now, and the next round of inflation will significantly impact her gains.  While it's still not a perfect split, accepting is the best strategy for me in this situation."
