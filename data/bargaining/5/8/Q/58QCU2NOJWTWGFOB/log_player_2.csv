"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair and generous split, leaving you with a substantial portion of the money. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal than 10% of the original amount. I'm hoping that Alice will offer a better split in the next round or that I can negotiate a better deal by making a counteroffer. Additionally, since Alice doesn't lose any value with each round, she may be more willing to negotiate to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll make an offer that takes that into account while still trying to negotiate a better deal.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 250000, ""alice_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this offer, I've increased my share to 25% of the original amount, taking into account the 5% decrease in value for me. I'm hoping that Alice will consider this a more reasonable offer, given the circumstances, and be willing to accept it or make a better counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice has increased her offer from the original 10%, the 9.75% decrease in value for me means that the 150,000 I'm being offered is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. Given this, I'm not willing to accept the offer, as I believe I can negotiate a better deal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. I'll try to make another offer that factors in the current value of the money and see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nConsidering the current decrease in value for me, I'll make an offer that takes into account the 9.75% decrease in value and tries to find a middle ground.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 280000, ""alice_gain"": 720000, ""message"": ""Given the current situation, I believe this split is more reasonable and takes into account the loss of value for me.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this offer, I've increased my share slightly from the previous round, trying to find a balance between the decreasing value of the money for me and Alice's need for a larger share. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a genuine attempt to compromise and be willing to accept the offer or make a better counteroffer. Since the money is worth less for me with each passing round, I'm trying to find a deal that is fair for both of us, considering the current circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. It's a significant compromise, but with each round, the value of the money diminishes for both of us. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given that the money is now worth 18.55% less for me than in the first round, I need to consider the diminishing returns of further negotiation. Alice has increased her offer to 20% of the original amount, which, although not ideal, is a significant improvement from her initial offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money for me and Alice's statement that this is her final offer, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this deal rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer ensures that I receive a substantial amount, even if it's not the best possible outcome."
