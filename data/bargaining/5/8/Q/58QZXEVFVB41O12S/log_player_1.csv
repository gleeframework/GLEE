"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fairer split, 55 for me and 45 for you. This offers a more even distribution and avoids risking further inflation in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
