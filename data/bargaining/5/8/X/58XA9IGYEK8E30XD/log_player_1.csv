Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly.  I think $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you is a fair compromise.  Let's end this before inflation eats away too much of our share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
