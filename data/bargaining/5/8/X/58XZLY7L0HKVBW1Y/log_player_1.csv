Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need to factor in inflation, but your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This offer is more balanced considering the faster rate at which my share loses value. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
