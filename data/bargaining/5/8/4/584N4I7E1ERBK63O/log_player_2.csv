"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 42

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me hard 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob, but this offer is still unacceptable. While she loses value quicker, getting only 40% of the (rapidly shrinking) pot puts Bob at a significant disadvantage.  It's worth holding out for a better offer, at least for another round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 59, ""alice_gain"": 41, ""message"": ""Let's settle this now before it's worthless.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm desperate, but still want a fair share 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offer reflects that. However, even with the rapidly decreasing value, getting only 35% is a terrible deal for Bob. The longer the game goes on, the more the shrinking pot favors Bob. It's worth risking another round or two to see if Alice will crack."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Time is running out, take this deal!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to push for even more, time is the real enemy now.  Every round, the value plummets, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure. This offer is strong for Bob, and the urgency in the message might be enough to push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a reasonable deal 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's finally happened - Alice has cracked under the pressure. While 30/70 is far from ideal, it's significantly better than getting nothing at all, which is a very real possibility with only three rounds left. The value of the money at this stage is almost irrelevant; it's about salvaging something from a rapidly deteriorating situation."
