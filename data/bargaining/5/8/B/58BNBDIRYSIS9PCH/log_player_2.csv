"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, considering the potential inflation. We can work together and both benefit in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's message sounds appealing, the proposed split is extremely uneven.  Bob gets a tiny fraction of the money, and the potential for inflation makes this offer even worse. It's better to reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a more equitable division than your last offer. We can end this game now and avoid the risk of inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the ongoing inflation. Let's split the difference from the last round, and avoid further risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's offer still favors her, it's a significant improvement from her initial proposal. Considering the 9.75% inflation affecting my share, accepting this offer ensures I gain a decent amount of money while mitigating the risk of further losses in future rounds."
