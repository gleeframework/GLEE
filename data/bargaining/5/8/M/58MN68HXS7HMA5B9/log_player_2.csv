This offer is very unfair.  I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
This offer is a more fair split. It gives me a larger share, but still leaves Alice with a significant portion. I believe it's a good starting point for a negotiation."
