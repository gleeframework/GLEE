"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential gain.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is making the offer now, I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting it against the risk of getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll reject this offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my patience""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not sure if it's worth it, considering the inflation is eating away at our gains 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain now. The money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

Considering the offers I've seen so far, this one seems relatively fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm hoping that I've made the right decision, considering the limited time we have left to divide the money."
