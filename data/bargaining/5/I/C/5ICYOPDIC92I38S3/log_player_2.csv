**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, Alice is clearly trying to wear me down. I need to show strength and a willingness to go further down the line, even if it means risking a worse outcome.  My offers are reasonable, and I'm hoping she'll see that soon."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, enough games.  A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Take it or leave it, we're running out of time."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

By now, it's clear Alice is unlikely to accept anything beyond a 60/40 split in her favor. I'm pushing to a 50/50 split as a last stand for a reasonable outcome. This shows resolve and also establishes a clear, easily justifiable position. It might be my strongest move given the remaining time and the clear pattern in Alice's offers."
