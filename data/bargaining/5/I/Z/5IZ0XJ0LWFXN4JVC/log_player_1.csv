Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he will accept it.  This ensures I get the lion's share of the money, while still showing I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While his offer is a bit better than my first proposal due to the inflation penalty on him,  it's still significantly worse than my initial plan. I believe I can secure a better deal for myself if I stick to my strategy of offering generous initial deals to see if Bob will budge.  I'm also banking on the fact that Bob might be unaware of the inflation effect on me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to slightly reduce my offer again, hoping to find a middle ground.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm assuming he is willing to negotiate. By lowering my share slightly, I'm increasing the chances of getting an agreement while still retaining the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While the inflation penalty has significantly lowered the value of Bob's offer for me, I still believe I can secure a better deal.  I'm going to keep pushing for a larger share of the money.  The inflation penalty is starting to impact Bob more heavily, so I'm optimistic that I can get him to accept a more favorable deal for me in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to continue to lower my offer, but I'm going to be more cautious this time. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I need to ensure I still get a good share of the money. I'm hoping that Bob, seeing the effect of inflation on himself, will be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Even though the inflation is hitting me hard now, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I believe I can still push for a larger share.  The inflation is impacting Bob much more severely than me, and I think that will give me an advantage in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still determined to get a fair share of the money. I'm going to lower my offer again, but not too drastically. I believe that Bob, seeing the negative impact of inflation on his own share, will be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is hitting me hard, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. It's significantly lower than my initial offer and while the inflation is taking a toll, I believe I can still push for a better deal.  The impact of inflation is much more severe on Bob, and I'm going to capitalize on that to get a more favorable offer in the next rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer once again, but I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and making sure the offer is enticing enough for Bob.  The inflation is impacting me heavily now, but I'm determined to get a better deal than what Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is starting to hit me very hard, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While the value of the money is drastically reduced for both of us, I'm going to continue to hold out for a better deal. The inflation is impacting Bob much more severely, and I believe that I can get him to agree to a better split if I remain firm."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to be more aggressive. I'm going to make a final attempt to reach an agreement. The inflation is significantly hurting both of us now, but I'm betting that Bob will be desperate enough to accept a more favorable deal for me."

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is it.  With only one round left, I have no choice but to accept. The inflation has been brutal, and even though Bob's offer is still much lower than my initial proposals, it's the best I can get at this point.  I'm going to have to accept this and hope that in future negotiations, I can remember this lesson in the dangers of inflation."
