"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $6,000, you get $4,000.  A fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to negotiate for a better split, considering the inflation that affects me. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the 20% inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. Let's make a deal before the money devalues further!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hitting you hard. I'm being generous - take this deal before it gets even worse for you! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the inflation is indeed affecting my gains, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to make another offer in the next round to see if I can get a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I'll adjust my offer to try and meet Alice halfway while still aiming for a favorable split. Here's my revised offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed taking its toll, but I believe a 52-48 split is a fair compromise. Let's settle before the value drops further!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a 55/45 split, which is more than fair considering the inflation. Take it or leave it - your money will be worth even less in the next round! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my gains, Alice's offer of a 55/45 split seems reasonable at this point. Continuing to negotiate may lead to further devaluation of my share, so I'll accept this deal to secure the $4500, which is still a considerable amount despite the reduced value."
