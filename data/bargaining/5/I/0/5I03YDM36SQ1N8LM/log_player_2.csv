"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it seems like a lot of money now, the longer the game goes on, the more the money depreciates for Alice. I can likely negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more equitable split considering the depreciation. This offer favors me slightly in the short term, but still leaves you with a substantial sum.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the depreciation, this is a fair offer, slightly in my favor but still generous 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is taking advantage of the situation, trying to frame a slightly better offer than her first as ""generous"" after the depreciation.  We need to push for a more equitable split while we still have some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. It's time to make a deal.""
}
