"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can propose next.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll give you a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain in Round 1 being worth the same as in Round 1, and Bob's gain being 10% less, I'll evaluate the new offer.

I'm not too thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's offer is better than the initial 60-40, I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
