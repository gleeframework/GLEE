"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It benefits us both to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's proposal is a fair starting point, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  I know the money will be worth less in the next round, but I'm hoping to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more evenly. I'm willing to offer you $45, which is still a good deal considering the money loses value each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. I'll agree to a more even split this time, but I need a larger share to compensate for the increasing inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, time is running out and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  This offer is pretty close to my previous proposal, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
