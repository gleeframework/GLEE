"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think strategically. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm actually getting a better deal than in the first round. I'll accept this offer.

```
