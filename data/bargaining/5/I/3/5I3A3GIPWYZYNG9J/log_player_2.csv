"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 95 and you get 5.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 5 dollar offer. I'll see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split it 55/45.  Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. Let's go with 60/40. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going with this. It's better to take the 40 now than risk getting nothing later."
