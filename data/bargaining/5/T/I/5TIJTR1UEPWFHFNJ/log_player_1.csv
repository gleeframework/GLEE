"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can reassess later""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 4000 * 0.9 = 3600.

I'm not sure I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, since I'm getting less than I was initially offered. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.
