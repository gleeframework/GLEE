"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to be generous and offer Bob a significant amount as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, Alice. I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 800,000, but I'll have to weigh the risks. My gain of 200,000 is significantly lower than before, and I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the game.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount, and I'm not giving away too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a significant amount and keeping a decent chunk for myself, considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, Alice. I need more to make up for the losses. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering Bob's final offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 900,000, but I'm also not sure if I can do better.

My gain of 100,000 is almost negligible at this point, and I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the game.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word and it's indeed his final offer.
