"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 3:2 in favor of Bob. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one, considering the inflation rate. It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
