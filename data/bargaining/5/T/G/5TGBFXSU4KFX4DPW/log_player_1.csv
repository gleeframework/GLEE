Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite greedy. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. Think carefully - inflation is eating away at our potential gains! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
