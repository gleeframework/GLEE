"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the initial $100. Accept and we can end the game now.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time. After all, I'm the one taking the risk by rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can do better, does he?

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you're taking a risk by rejecting my offer? I'm the one who's losing value with each passing round due to inflation! I'm not convinced a 60/40 split in your favor is a good deal for me.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's getting late, Bob! I'm willing to meet you in the middle and propose a 50/50 split. Let's end this game and walk away with a fair share.""
}
