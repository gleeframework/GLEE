Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's getting late, Bob! I'm willing to meet you in the middle and propose a 50/50 split. Let's end this game and walk away with a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. It's getting risky with the inflation, and 50/50 is a fair compromise."
