Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm going to assume he's more susceptible to it than I am and try to grab most of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes it risky to keep rejecting offers. A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances."
