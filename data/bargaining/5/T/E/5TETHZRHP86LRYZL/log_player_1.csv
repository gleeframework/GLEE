Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  Since we're both losing value, I think this is a fair compromise that allows us to both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
