"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit imbalanced, Alice. Let's be fair - I take $60, you take $40. Remember, the value decreases with each round, so it's in your best interest to accept. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
