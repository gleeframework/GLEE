"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split is fair considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer that gives Alice 60% of the money. I think I can do better than that, especially since the money is worth less to me with each passing round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm facing.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to make an offer that gives me 55% of the money, taking into account the fact that the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. This offer acknowledges the inflation you're facing. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm still not satisfied with Alice's offer. Although she claims to be meeting me closer to the middle, I think I can negotiate for a better deal. The inflation is a significant factor, and I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a better offer. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to account for the increasing inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make an offer that gives me 52.5% of the money. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and acknowledging the inflation that's affecting my gains. I hope Alice will see this as a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise, Bob. I'm taking a slightly smaller share to account for the inflation you're experiencing. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, which has reduced the value of my gains by 18.55%, I think Alice's offer is reasonable. I'm getting 47.5% of the original amount, which is a decent compromise. If I continue to reject offers, the inflation will only decrease my gains further. It's time to accept the offer and walk away with something rather than risking getting nothing."
