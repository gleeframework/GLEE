**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than Bob. While her offers are getting closer to a more even split, she's still trying to take a larger share. By continuing to reject her offers, Bob puts himself in a stronger position to make a favorable counter-offer as the game progresses and inflation eats away at Alice's potential gains."
