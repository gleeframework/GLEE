Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money. This offer benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was kind, but ultimately doesn't benefit me as much as it does you. Let's be pragmatic: I'll take a larger share this round, understanding the value decreases quickly for both of us as time passes. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
