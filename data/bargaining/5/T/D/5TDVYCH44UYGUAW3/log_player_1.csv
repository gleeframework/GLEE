"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 45 is now worth 36 (80% of 45) and Bob's gain of 55 is worth 49 (90% of 55).

I'll reject this offer. I'm looking for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In this round, my gain is worth 72% of the previous round's gain (36 * 0.8 = 28.8), and Bob's gain is worth 90% of the previous round's gain (49 * 0.9 = 44.1).

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}

This offer is a bit more generous to Bob, but I'm still trying to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains in this round:

My gain of 40 is worth 40 * 0.5192 = 20.768 (since 100 * 0.5192 is the value of my gain in this round, which is 48.8% less than the value of my gain in the first round).

Bob's gain of 60 is worth 60 * 0.7279 = 43.674 (since 100 * 0.7279 is the value of Bob's gain in this round, which is 27.1% less than the value of Bob's gain in the first round).

I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than nothing!
