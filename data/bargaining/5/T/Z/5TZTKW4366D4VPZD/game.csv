5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to adjust my offer to 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This takes into account the impact of inflation on both sides while still aiming for a fair split.",Alice,3,

,,"While I agree that time is of the essence, Bob, your offer doesn't reflect a fair partnership.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a disproportionate share.",Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear that we need to find a solution quickly. The inflation is working against us both.  Let's make it simple: a 50/50 split. It's fair, it's straightforward, and it allows us to walk away with something substantial before things get any worse.",Alice,5,
