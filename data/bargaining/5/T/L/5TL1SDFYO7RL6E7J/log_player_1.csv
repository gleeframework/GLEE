Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

""alice_gain"": 6000,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation. 58/42 is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, his offer is still not advantageous to me. I'm aiming to secure at least $6000.  Bob's offer is getting closer to a point where I might consider accepting, but it's not there yet.  He's losing value quickly, which puts me in a stronger bargaining position."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5900,
""bob_gain"": 4100,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and your share is losing value fast. I'm offering 59/41. Take it before it shrinks even further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying a bit more pressure now.  By slightly lowering my demand, I signal some flexibility, but I'm still aiming to maximize my gains while Bob's bargaining power weakens.  The message emphasizes the urgency and the real loss he faces with each passing round."
