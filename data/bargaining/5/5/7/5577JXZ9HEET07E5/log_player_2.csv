"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10, a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I'll hold out for a better deal. ðŸ˜‰"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""Let's be practical, I'll take 95%, you can have the rest.  It's your turn next, so make it worth my while.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 50/50 is out of the question. Let's split it 60/40 this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, 400,000 is a decent gain, and I'm not sure Alice will budge much further.  It's a good deal for me considering the inflation factor."
