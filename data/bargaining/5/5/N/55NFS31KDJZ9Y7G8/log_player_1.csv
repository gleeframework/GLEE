"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering the initial amount is $10,000. I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money, but I'm also keeping a substantial amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth less, so I'm more inclined to accept a higher amount. However, Bob's offer is 50/50 split, which is a very fair proposal. I'll accept this offer.
