"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, and leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the adjusted amounts.

For me, the offer is 7000, which is worth 0.95 x 7000 = 6650 in the first round's value.
For Bob, the offer is 3000, which is worth 0.8 x 3000 = 2400 in the first round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
