"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm keeping the majority of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, I'm facing a 10% decrease in the value of my potential gain, while Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
