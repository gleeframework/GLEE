"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a bit more fair, considering the value of the money is declining. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, especially since the money is worth less than it was in the first round. I was hoping for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Let's try again!

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. 50-50 seems like a fair split, considering the value of the money is declining.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise given the current state of the money."
