"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent amount to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it more fairly, I won't accept anything less than this.""}\n\n###\nSince I'm Bob, I will try to be more aggressive in my offer because each round the money is worth 10% less for me. I will try to get the most out of the early rounds. Waiting for Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal than the last offer. Let's split it 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nSince the money is worth 19% less for me, Alice's offer of 3000 is actually worth even less. Considering the inflation, I think I can try to push for a better deal in the next round. I'll reject this offer and make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a fair share. This is my final offer.""}\n\n###\nSince the money is worth less and less for me each round, I need to try to get the best deal possible. I'll offer a slightly lower amount than my previous offer, but still try to get more than Alice's previous offer. This is my final offer, so I hope Alice accepts it. Waiting for Alice's response."
