"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if 50/50 is the best option, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to make another proposal to see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 15% less than in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more aggressive this time. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not sure if I can do better, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to another round."
