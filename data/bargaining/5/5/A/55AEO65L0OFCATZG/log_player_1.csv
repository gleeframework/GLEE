"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal. 90% for me, 10% for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is far too low for me. I'm not willing to accept such a huge drop in my share.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I've lowered my demand slightly to 80% for me, 20% for Bob.  I'm hoping this is more appealing, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, considering the inflation and the fact that he's offering me less than half the money. I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money. This offer gives Bob 30%, which is more than he received in his last offer, but I'm still getting 70%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is ridiculous! Bob's offer keeps getting lower, despite the fact that he's losing less money to inflation. I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm taking a bigger risk by lowering my share again, but I want to close this deal before the inflation makes things even worse.  I'm offering 60% for me, 40% for Bob. Hopefully, this is enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is getting absurd.  Bob's offer keeps plummeting despite the fact that his inflation rate is much lower.  I refuse to accept this low of a share, I'll see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm reaching the point where I need to compromise significantly to avoid getting nothing. This offer is a 50/50 split,  which is fair given the drastic inflation we're both facing.  Let's see if Bob finally agrees to this."
