"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give away half the money so easily. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

Since Bob is offering me $400,000, which is worth 40% of the original amount, I'm not thrilled about it. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting nothing if Bob rejects my next offer.

I'll accept this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
