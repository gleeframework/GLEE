"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a chance to accept or reject.""
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90/10 split is more fair. We can talk about it further if you're open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

My gain: $100,000 * 0.9 = $90,000
Bob's gain: $900,000 * 0.8 = $720,000

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 90/10 split is a bit too skewed in his favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 90/10 split. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

$900,000 * 0.9 = $810,000
$100,000 * 0.8 = $80,000

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```"
