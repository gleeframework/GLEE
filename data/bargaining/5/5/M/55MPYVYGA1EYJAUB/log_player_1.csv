"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount of money, but it's a good starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, I'll have to calculate the total amount of money left and see if this is a good deal for me.

The total amount of money left is still $1,000,000. Since I offered $900,000 in the first round, the amount left is $1,000,000 - $900,000 = $100,000.

Now, let's see what Bob's offer means in terms of the total amount. If we split the money evenly, I'll get $500,000, and Bob will get $500,000.

Since I offered $900,000 in the first round, I'm essentially giving up $400,000 to get $500,000. This doesn't seem like a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was to split the money evenly, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to increase my chances of getting a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! You won't get a better offer than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share of the money, but I'm hoping he'll accept this deal to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's avoid any further losses from inflation and settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts of money Bob is offering.

Since the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and he offered $100,000 in the first round, the actual amount he's offering now is:

$100,000 * 0.5162 (1 - 0.4838) = $51,620

Similarly, the total amount of money left is still $1,000,000. Since I offered $900,000 in the first round, the amount left is $1,000,000 - $900,000 = $100,000.

Now, let's see what Bob's offer means in terms of the total amount. If we accept this offer, I'll get $600,000, and Bob will get $51,620.

This seems like a good deal for me, considering the inflation and the fact that I'll be getting a significant amount of money.
