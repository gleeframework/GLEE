"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This offers a fair split considering the potential for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to try and get a bigger share in the first round, since the money will be worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60:40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. This will allow for a more balanced outcome for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division of the money, considering the uncertainty of inflation. This ensures fairness for both parties. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if I reject again, accepting a 50/50 split is the most sensible choice."
