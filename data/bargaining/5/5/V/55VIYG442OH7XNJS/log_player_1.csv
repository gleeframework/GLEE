"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. We can discuss further if you want.""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount is $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think 60/40 is a more fair split considering the potential for future inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is not an improvement over my initial offer. I'll make a new offer: 55 for me and 45 for you. Let's see if you'll accept this one.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less now due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""As I mentioned in my previous message, I'm willing to give you 45. I think this is a fair split considering the current value of the money.""
}
