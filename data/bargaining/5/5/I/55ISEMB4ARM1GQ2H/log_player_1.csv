Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see we're getting closer. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is trying to find a middle ground, the deal is still heavily skewed in his favor due to the inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Bob will become, and the more likely he is to offer a fairer split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  It's the fairest option considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm offering a 50/50 split now to appear fair and decisive. While I could push for more, there's a risk Bob will get increasingly aggressive with his demands as the rounds progress, potentially leading to a stalemate and no money for either of us.  A clean split minimizes risk at this stage."
