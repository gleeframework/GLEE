Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the initial offer was 7:3. I'm trying to be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
