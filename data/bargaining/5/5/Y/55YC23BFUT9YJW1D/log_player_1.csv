Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","This is a tough spot. Bob is clearly taking advantage of the inflation situation. We need to adjust our strategy.

""alice_gain"": 40,
""bob_gain"": 60,
""message"": ""Bob, this inflation is brutal. I need to secure something.  Let's end this.""

We are now aiming for damage control. Accepting anything less than 40 at this stage would leave us with almost nothing after inflation.  Let's hope Bob sees the urgency."

It's painful, but Bob has us backed into a corner.  Rejecting this offer means we risk getting nothing at all. Taking the $10, while heavily impacted by inflation, is still better than walking away empty-handed."
