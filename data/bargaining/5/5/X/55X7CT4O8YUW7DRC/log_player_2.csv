"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70/30. I think it's fair considering the inflation might affect us more in the future rounds.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I think 51/49 is a fairer split considering we both have the chance to get a better deal in the next round.  Let's be reasonable and move forward.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a split of 60/40. This maintains a balance while accounting for potential future value loss. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Alice's offer is better than the last round, and I'm not sure how much the inflation will affect us in the future. Accepting this will at least guarantee a gain."
