Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair offer, as I will be taking the first offer and it will be worth more to me in the next round.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm going to reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 20 dollars.  He's probably going to accept this as he's been greedy so far and there's no guarantee he'll get anything in the next round if he rejects this offer.  It's a good deal for me too, as the money I receive will be worth more than if we continue the game to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky - I'm losing a lot of value to inflation.  Bob's offer is better than what I could get in the next round.  I'll accept it, but this is a lesson to be more generous in the future."
