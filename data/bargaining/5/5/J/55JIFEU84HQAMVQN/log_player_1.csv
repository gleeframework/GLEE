"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, keeping in mind that I have 12 rounds to negotiate, and I want to maximize my gains.  I'm also taking into account the inflation, which affects Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. Bob's inflation rate means he's losing money each round, so it's unlikely he'll offer me more in the future.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a good chunk of the money, rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
