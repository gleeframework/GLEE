"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, with me taking 90% and you taking 10%. This way, we both get something, and I can justify it by being the one proposing first! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible deal for Bob! Even though Alice tries to justify it, it's not a fair split. Bob should reject and see what Alice offers in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
