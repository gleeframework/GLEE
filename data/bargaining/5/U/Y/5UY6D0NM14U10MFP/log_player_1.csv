"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 5000 is actually equivalent to 4000 in the first round. That's not a bad compromise, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not quite there, Bob. Can you offer me a bit more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like a bit more for myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less now (20% less each round, compounded), my gain of 4000 is actually equivalent to 2083.33 in the first round. That's not a good deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not enough for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal.""
