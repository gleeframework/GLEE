"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered me 30% of the initial amount, I'm now offering you 90% and keeping 10% for myself. It's a significant concession, but I think it's a fairer split considering the initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
