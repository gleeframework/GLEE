Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out. I'm willing to take a bigger share to secure this deal. We need to act fast before inflation devours our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less due to inflation. Bob is clearly using time pressure to his advantage. It's risky, but holding out for a better offer is still the better play.  We're getting into dangerous territory, though."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Bob needs to understand the urgency and the disadvantage Alice is at due to inflation. Offering slightly less than before while making it clear this is the final offer might push him to accept."
