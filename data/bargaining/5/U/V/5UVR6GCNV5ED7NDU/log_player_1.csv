"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also subtly implying that I'm willing to take the majority of the money."
