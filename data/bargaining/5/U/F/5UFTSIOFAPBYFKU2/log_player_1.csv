Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared for him to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting to accept something, I know that if I reject, the next round I'll be able to propose a split that is more favorable to me.  I can't be sure how Bob will react to inflation, so I'm going to gamble and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering an 80/20 split in my favor.  Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'm hoping he'll be more open to a compromise.  I also know the money is losing value, so I want to secure as much as possible before it's worth less."
