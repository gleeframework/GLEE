Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty generous offer, given that I know I have the advantage of being the first to propose. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though the money is worth less, a 10/90 split is still very unfavorable to me. I'm hoping that we can reach a more equitable agreement in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to propose a 45/55 split in my favor. I'm willing to give Bob a larger share of the money this time, hoping he will see the value in reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I'm hoping to avoid going through too many more rounds."
