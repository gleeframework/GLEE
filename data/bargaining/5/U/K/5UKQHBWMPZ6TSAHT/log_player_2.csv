# Alice's message: Even split is not fair considering the inflation, I need a better deal 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While a 50/50 split in round 6 might have been the most ""fair"" in principle, it's clear she's going to keep pushing for more.  I need to hold firm and hope she gets more reasonable as the rounds progress and she realizes she gets nothing if we fail."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""This is my last offer. It's clear you're trying to exploit the inflation, but we both lose if this fails. Agree to this and we both walk away with something.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I need to signal I'm willing to compromise, but I also need to draw a line. Offering her the same deal she offered me in round 1 seems like a reasonable compromise at this stage. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be pushed around."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said it's your last offer, but I think you'll take this rather than get nothing 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting desperate and assuming I'll crack. However, accepting this would set a terrible precedent and likely lead to worse offers. It's a gamble, but I need to show I'm serious about my bottom line."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alright, Alice.  This is it.  Take it or leave it.  You're pushing your luck, but I'd rather we both get something than nothing at all.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out.  I'm now offering what she offered me in round 5. This is a significant concession on my part and should show her I'm serious about ending this. It's a risky move, as she might interpret it as weakness, but with only three rounds left, it's a risk I have to take."
