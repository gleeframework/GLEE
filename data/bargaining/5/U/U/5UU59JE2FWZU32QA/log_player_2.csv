# Alice gain: 525000

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, you've made your point. Let's split this 50/50 before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. It's a fair deal that ensures we both leave with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer 60/40, with the inflation hitting so hard, taking 50/50 is a better deal than risking getting nothing."
