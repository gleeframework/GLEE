Bob is being stubborn and not acknowledging the impact of inflation.  We need to encourage him to be more realistic.  Holding out for a better deal is still the best option, even with the shrinking pot."

This is a tough spot, but I still think holding out is the right move. Bob is *very* focused on the nominal amounts, and not thinking about the shrinking pot. He's likely to panic as the deadline approaches and might offer a better deal in the next round or two.  We're running out of time, but it's not over yet!"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, you've made your point. Let's split this 50/50 before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. It's a fair deal that ensures we both leave with something substantial."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're entering a critical stage. Bob is locked into his position, but his ultimatum wasn't serious since he didn't accept getting nothing in the last round. 

* **Time Pressure:** We have limited rounds left, and the value is dropping rapidly.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** His focus seems fixated on the 60/40 split, ignoring the bigger picture. 
* **50/50 as Leverage:**  A straight split might be the wake-up call he needs to see the value rapidly decreasing. 

It's a risk, but a calculated one. This offer forces Bob to confront the reality of the situation."
