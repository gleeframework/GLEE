"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. We can work out a more equitable split later if you prefer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 10% is better than nothing, it's a very lopsided deal.  Let's see if I can get a better offer.  I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
