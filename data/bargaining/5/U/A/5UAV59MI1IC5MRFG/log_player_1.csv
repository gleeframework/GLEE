"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair proposal, but I'm aiming to get a large portion of the money since it depreciates faster for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far less than my previous offer, and with the inflation, it's not worth it for me to accept. I'm going to try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm raising my stake again, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before inflation eats away at his potential gains. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but trying to find a balance that's fair enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for, especially considering the significant inflation that has occurred.  I'm going to keep pushing for a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, hoping to find a middle ground. Bob's offer in the previous round was too low, but I also need to be mindful of the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 488000 
# Bob gain: 512000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to being fair, the inflation has severely diminished the value of his proposal.  I believe I can still get a better deal with a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm making a final push for a more equitable split, while still aiming for a larger portion given the inflation disadvantage Bob faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 590400 
# Bob gain: 409600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly more favorable for me than my previous offer, especially considering the rapid inflation rate.  This is a good deal for me, and it's getting increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers."
