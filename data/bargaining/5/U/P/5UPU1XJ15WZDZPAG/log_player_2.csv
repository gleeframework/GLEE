# Alice's message: You should take this before inflation eats more of your share

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, inflation is killing your share 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $430,000 is better than risking another round where my bargaining position weakens further. Delaying any longer could lead to even less favorable offers."
