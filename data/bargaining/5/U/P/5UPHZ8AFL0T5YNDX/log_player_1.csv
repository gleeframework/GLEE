"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm trying to be generous to start the negotiation, but I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest option, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to take that into account.

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain: $5,000
Bob's gain: $4,750 (5% less than $5,000)

Considering the offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I was hoping to get a higher amount, considering the inflation. However, splitting the money evenly is a fair option, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
