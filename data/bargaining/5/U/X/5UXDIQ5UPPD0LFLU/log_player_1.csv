"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start with!""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, but I'm hoping for more! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't want to give away too much, but meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
