# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we're both losing out with each round. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of our gains, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer at this point. The difference between our gains isn't substantial, and further rounds will only decrease the value of the money. Let's conclude the game here!"
