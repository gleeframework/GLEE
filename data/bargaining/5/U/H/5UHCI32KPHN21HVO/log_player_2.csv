Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but don't think you have the upper hand 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims to be compromising, the deal is getting worse for Bob with each round due to the uneven inflation. Alice is clearly banking on Bob panicking as the rounds progress.  It's still in Bob's best interest to hold out for a better offer, even though time is running out."

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop pretending. The inflation is hurting you far more than me. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""}
