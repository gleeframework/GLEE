Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

# Alice gain: 5800

I'm still hoping for a better deal, even with inflation. Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your end, I think 60-40 is a more suitable split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, and this one is fairly close to my initial proposal. It's time to secure some of the money before inflation wipes out most of it."
