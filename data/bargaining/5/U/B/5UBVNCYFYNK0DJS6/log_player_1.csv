  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor""

Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of 3000 is worth 95% of the original value, since it's 5% less due to inflation.

I'm not sure if this is a fair compromise, considering the initial offer was 60-40 and now it's 30-70. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.
