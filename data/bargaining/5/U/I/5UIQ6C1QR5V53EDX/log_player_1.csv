"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an even split, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering I'm taking the risk of inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation factor.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable to me, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation factor.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of the inflation entirely. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to protect my own interests."
