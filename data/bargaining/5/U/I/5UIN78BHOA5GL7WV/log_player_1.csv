Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, considering I'm taking the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 88 
# Bob gain: 12 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better, but I'm not going to settle for less than 90% right now. I think I can get a better deal!  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm sticking with my original proposal. I think it's fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection again. Bob knows that if he rejects this, we'll be further down the line with inflation impacting us both.  Let's see if he takes the deal!"
