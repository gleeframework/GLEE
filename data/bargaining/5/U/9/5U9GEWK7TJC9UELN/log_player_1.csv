"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 70/30 split is more fair.  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to start by giving you a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that a 70/30 split is fair, considering I was willing to give Bob 20% in the first round. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 60/40. It's a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a more moderate compromise between my initial 80/20 offer and Bob's 70/30 offer."
