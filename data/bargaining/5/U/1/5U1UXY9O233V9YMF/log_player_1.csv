"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to keep things friendly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a decent deal. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair split, but I'm not getting less than half 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $4,500 in ""real"" terms.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him an equal share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
