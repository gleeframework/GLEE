"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount to ensure he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is now more appealing, I'll accept it.
