"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money closer to 40/60, with me taking the smaller share.  It's still a better deal than losing everything to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000
