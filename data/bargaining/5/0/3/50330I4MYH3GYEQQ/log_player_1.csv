"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to take the lion's share this round, but let's be reasonable here. We both need to get something, otherwise the inflation will eat away all our potential gains.  Let's work together to reach a fair solution in the remaining rounds. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
