Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Your share decreases with each round due to inflation. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  It's clear you value your share highly, but further delay only hurts us both.  Take this offer so we both benefit! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

At this point, it's clear Bob is willing to play hardball and wait me out.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting his offer in Round 6 is the best option left.  Further delays will only erode my potential gain, and Bob seems firm in his position."
