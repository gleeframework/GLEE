"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $5000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this case, Bob's offer would be equivalent to a 40/60 split in the first round, which I didn't find acceptable.

However, considering the reduced value of the money I gain in this round, I'm willing to accept a slightly less favorable split. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
