"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can do better later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's be fair and start with an even split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll gain $54 (60% of $90) and Bob will gain $60.

I don't like the 40-60 split, I'd like to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 81% of its original value, so I'll gain $81% of my desired amount from the previous round, which is $54. So, I'll gain $43.58 ($54 x 0.81).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, giving me $45 and Bob $55."
