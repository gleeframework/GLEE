"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

After considering the inflation factor, I realize that my gain of $300,000 is actually worth $270,000 (90% of $300,000), which is a significant reduction.

However, I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $700,000 is also affected by inflation, so I'll have to consider the possibility that it might be worth even more than $700,000.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $450,000 is worth 72.9% of the original value, which is $729,000 (after 27.1% decrease).

Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 51.2% of the original value, which is $512,000 (after 48.8% decrease).

Considering the actual values, I think this offer is a good compromise.
