Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going to split it evenly 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering slightly more, the inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. It's getting riskier to keep rejecting, but I need to push for a more favorable outcome.  A 50/50 split is the only fair deal at this point."
