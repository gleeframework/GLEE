"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%. But remember, inflation is a thing! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 100,000 is something, it's a tiny fraction of the total money.  Inflation is a huge risk, and I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the risk of inflation. Let's be reasonable and finish this quickly.""}
