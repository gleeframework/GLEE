# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a more equitable solution. Let's try a 99/1 split, with me taking the larger share. This will ensure that we both get something, and it allows for a more fair distribution of the money. Let me know what you think!

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is impacting us both, but I'm willing to split the money 70/30 in my favor, considering I've been consistently offering fairer splits than you. Let's end this game and both get a good share before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting.  The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and accepting this offer at least secures me a decent amount of money."
