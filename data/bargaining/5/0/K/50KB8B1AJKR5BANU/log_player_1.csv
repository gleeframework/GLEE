This offer gives me a good starting point, but I'm trying to be fair.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though I'm losing a bit due to inflation, this is a fair deal. It's better than risking further inflation in subsequent rounds."
