"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my proposal from the previous round would be equivalent to $54 for me and $36 for Bob, which is even more skewed towards Bob's favor. Bob's current offer of $30 for me and $70 for him is actually a better deal for me than my original proposal, so I'll accept it.
