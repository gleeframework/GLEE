"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm confident we can find a better solution as we go along. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's message suggests a collaborative approach, the offer is highly unequal.  It's better to see if I can get a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair 50/50 split.  We can adjust as needed, but I think it's a good starting point."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make up for the inflation.  Let's try this and see if it works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, the offer is still too lopsided in her favor. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to account for inflation, but I need a fair amount to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""
