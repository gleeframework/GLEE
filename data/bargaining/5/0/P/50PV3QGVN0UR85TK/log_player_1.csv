I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I want to secure a large portion of the money early on before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid getting nothing. I'll offer a 85/15 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Inflation is eating away at the potential gains, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
