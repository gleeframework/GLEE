"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled, but I'll accept it. I'll take the $6,000 and hope to do better in future rounds.
