Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's a fair deal, and waiting any longer hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, but its value is decreasing for Bob, I can afford to wait a bit longer for a potentially better deal. However, Bob's message suggests this is his final offer, and considering the fairness of the proposed split, I might lean towards accepting it to ensure I get at least half.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how it goes!"
