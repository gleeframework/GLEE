"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was unfair considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable, this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting you more. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  We are both losing money with every round. This split gives us both a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While not ideal, it's better to accept than risk getting a worse offer in round 5 where the inflation will hurt us both even more. Bob is likely to be more stubborn in future rounds as his losses are higher."
