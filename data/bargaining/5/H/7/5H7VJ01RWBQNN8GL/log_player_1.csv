"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a fair (but slightly advantageous) offer.  I'm willing to give Bob 10% of the money. I want to see if he's willing to accept a smaller share, but I don't want to alienate him completely in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair! Even though the money is worth less now, I'm not going to accept a mere $5. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to negotiate. 80/20 is a more balanced split, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept before the inflation gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still extremely unfair! The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm not going to accept such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

The inflation is starting to seriously impact my gains, so I'm going to offer Bob a more substantial share.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting before the inflation gets even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

The inflation is making things tough, but I'm still not willing to accept such a low share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

Inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm willing to offer Bob a larger share, but I still want to get at least 60% of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the inflation is starting to make this offer more tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not going to give in to Bob's pressure just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

The inflation is really hitting hard now, and I'm starting to run out of time. I'm going to offer Bob an even split to try and get the deal done. I'm not sure if he'll accept, but it's my best chance at getting anything at all."
