"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be reasonable"". This is a generous offer, considering I'm taking on the risk of inflation, while Bob's share remains unaffected. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer and we can conclude the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the split is more balanced, I'm taking on the risk of inflation, which reduces the value of my share. In the first round, the 60-40 split I offered was already a compromise, considering the unequal effects of inflation. Accepting this offer would put me at a disadvantage, so I'll proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise""}\n\nI'm offering a 57-43 split in my favor, with the message ""Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise"". Given that my share is worth 10% less due to inflation, I believe this offer is a reasonable adjustment to the original 60-40 split I proposed. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the impact of inflation and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hitting you hard.  Let's settle this now with a split that works for us both. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although Bob acknowledges the impact of inflation on my share, the offer doesn't adequately compensate for the 27.1% decrease in value I'm facing. Accepting this offer would still put me at a disadvantage. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to find a more favorable agreement that takes into account the growing effect of inflation on my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, let's be realistic""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with the message ""Inflation is taking its toll, let's be realistic"". Given that my share is now worth 27.1% less due to inflation, I believe this offer is a reasonable adjustment to the previous splits I proposed. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the significant impact of inflation on my share and accept this offer, considering it's still a relatively fair division of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair 50/50 split. Let's end this now before inflation eats away any more of your share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer. Although I initially aimed for a higher share, the 50-50 split is a fair division of the original amount. Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, which is now worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision to minimize further losses. Continuing to negotiate may lead to an even lower value for my share, so I'll settle for this reasonable offer and conclude the game."
