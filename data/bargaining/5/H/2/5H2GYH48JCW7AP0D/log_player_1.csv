"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60, leaving Bob with $40, and sends a message suggesting that this division is somewhat fair but slightly in her favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This offer won't be around forever. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I initially proposed a division where I would take $60, and Bob's counteroffer of $45 is significantly lower than what I initially suggested. Given that the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first, I'm willing to hold out for a better offer, especially since Bob's portion will continue to decrease in value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've reduced my initial proposal slightly, from $60 to $58, to show a willingness to compromise. I've also pointed out that, considering the inflation affecting Bob's portion, this offer is more advantageous to him than it appears at first glance. The aim is to create a sense of urgency and reasonableness, encouraging Bob to accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating our profits! Let's split it evenly before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's message emphasizing the urgency due to inflation, an even split of $50 each is still less than my initial and revised proposals. Since the money's value remains unchanged for me but continues to decrease for Bob, I see no reason to accept an offer that doesn't meet my previous suggestions, especially when Bob is the one experiencing the loss in value. By holding out, I maintain the pressure on Bob, whose portion will continue to devalue, potentially leading to a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""This is as low as I'm willing to go""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've reduced my proposed share by another dollar, from $58 to $57, to demonstrate a continued willingness to compromise, albeit minimally. The message is firm, indicating that this is the most concession I'm willing to make, aiming to convey to Bob that further negotiations may not yield a better result for him. Given the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's share, I'm betting that the pressure of devaluing money will encourage him to accept this offer rather than risk further rounds."
