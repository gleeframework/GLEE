"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and I get a bit more""}\n\nSince I am Alice, I will make the first proposal. I will offer Bob $400,000 and I will take $600,000. I think this is a fair offer since I am the one making the first move. I added a message to Bob, ""Let's be fair and I get a bit more"" to explain my reasoning. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it evenly, but I'll take a bit more since you got the bigger share last time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I am Alice, I will respond to Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth 10% less to me and only 5% less to Bob, and considering the offer is not very favorable to me, I will reject the offer. I don't think it's fair that Bob takes a bigger share this time, especially since the money is losing value faster for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again! Since the money is losing value faster for me, I will try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being somewhat reasonable. I will offer Bob $350,000 and I will take $650,000. I think this is a decent offer considering the circumstances.

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer""}\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
