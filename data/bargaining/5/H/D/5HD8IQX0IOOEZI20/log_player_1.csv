"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can stop here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm keeping the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fairer split.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of $45 is equivalent to $50 in the first round. Similarly, Bob's gain of $55 is equivalent to $61.11 in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still a bit more favorable to him, but I'll consider it. However, I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, my gain of $45 is now worth 90% of the value it was in the second round, so it's equivalent to $40.50 in the first round. I'll keep this amount in mind when making my offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 50% of the remaining $100, which is $50. I'm keeping the other 50%, which is also $50."
