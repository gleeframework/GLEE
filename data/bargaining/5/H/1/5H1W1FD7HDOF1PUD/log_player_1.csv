I'm starting with a high offer for myself, but I'm not being greedy. I want to see if Bob will accept this early on. I'm also aware of the inflation, so I'm hoping to secure a good portion of the money before it loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is a serious factor now.  I'm not sure how Bob is affected, but I need to secure some of this money before it's worth even less. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
