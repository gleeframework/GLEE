"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants a bit more, huh?

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 4:6 split. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less for me now, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in round 2. Time to adjust my offer!

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to be too generous""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and keeping some of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not giving me enough, I'll take most of it 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on me!

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob 7000, but I don't want to risk going to round 5 either...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get."
