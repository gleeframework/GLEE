"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $600,000 in the first round is now worth $480,000 (20% less). Bob's gain of $400,000 is now worth $380,000 (5% less).

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $500,000, which is worth $400,000 after inflation. This is less than what I would have gained in the first round. However, it's a 5% increase from the value of Bob's offer in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
