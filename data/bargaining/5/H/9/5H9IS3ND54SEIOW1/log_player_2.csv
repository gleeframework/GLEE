Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is heavily discounting the impact of inflation on her end. While her offer seems like a compromise, it still heavily favors her when considering the rapid devaluation of the money. We need to push for a more equitable split while time remains."
