"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a generous share, but I think I deserve the majority!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting $500,000, which is worth $450,000 in the first round's value.

I think this is a fair offer, considering the circumstances. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
