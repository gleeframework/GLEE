"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This is a straightforward proposal where I'm taking the entire $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, fair and square. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the offer from Bob is actually a good deal for me.

I accept the offer.
