"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  I'll see if Bob accepts it or tries to push for more.  Let's see how the game goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation hurts, I'm not going to accept such a drastic shift in favor of Bob after he rejected my offer. I'll make my own counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, while still trying to be fair. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, as I'm willing to give him more than he offered in the previous round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and the inflation is really hurting me.  But I'm still not going to accept an offer where I get so little. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42} 
```

This round, I'm offering a compromise, acknowledging the inflation but also trying to be fair to Bob.  I'm hoping that after rejecting my last two offers, Bob will see that I'm willing to be flexible and negotiate a reasonable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is getting ridiculous.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, and I'm not going to let him walk all over me. I'll counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 46, ""bob_gain"": 54} 
```

I'm offering a slight increase in Bob's share hoping he sees that I'm trying to compromise, even though the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share.  I need to find a balance between getting something and avoiding a complete loss!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the inflation is eating away at my share, I'm still not willing to give Bob such a large portion of the money. This game is becoming a test of wills, and I'm determined to hold out for a better offer.  I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 37, ""bob_gain"": 63} 
```

This is a tough one.  With the inflation continuing to hurt my share, I need to make a move that might appeal to Bob. I'm offering a slight increase in his share again, hoping he will see that I'm willing to compromise and end this game before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a tough call. The inflation has significantly diminished my share, but I'm running out of time. Accepting this offer at least gives me something, and it's closer to an even split than any of Bob's previous offers. It's time to cut my losses and end this game."
