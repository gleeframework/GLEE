"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I believe we can work out a more favorable split. Let's continue negotiations!\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor this time.""}\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation factor and tries to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties. Given that the money's value decreases with each round, I'm aiming to secure a slightly larger share while still being reasonable and leaving room for negotiation.\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation on both our gains, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise at this point. The value of the money has decreased significantly, especially for Alice, making this offer more acceptable than the initial proposal. Ending the game here ensures we both walk away with something, taking into account the diminishing value of the money with each passing round.\n\n###"
