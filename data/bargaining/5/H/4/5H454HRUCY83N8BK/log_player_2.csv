Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer! Your share is rapidly decreasing and you'll end up with less than what I'm offering now! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's painful, but Bob's share is getting eaten alive by inflation. Accepting a smaller share now is better than risking getting nothing in a few more rounds."
