Bob's offer:

This is a tough situation, and rationally, I should still reject. However, Bob has demonstrated he's unwilling to negotiate fairly and is using the inflation against me.  

If I reject, the next offer will likely be even worse, and the inflation will continue to erode my potential gains. Accepting a 30/70 split is bad, but it's better than getting a worse deal in the next round or being left with a pittance as the game continues."
