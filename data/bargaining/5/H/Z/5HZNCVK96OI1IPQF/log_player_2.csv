"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it fairly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money fairly, 50/50, which is the most equitable distribution, there's no reason to reject it and potentially end up with less in subsequent rounds. Accepting ensures a guaranteed fair share."
