"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and aim for a slightly favorable outcome for me in this first round, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle this round, Alice.  We can negotiate further if you'd prefer, but I think a fair split is a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! It's depreciating fast for you. Let's settle this now with a slight advantage for me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is eating away at my potential earnings quickly. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure at least some of the money before it's worth even less."
