"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he will accept and we can finish the game quickly. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split and see if we can improve it 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my potential gain is now $8,500.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too even, I'd like to aim for a higher gain""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50/50 split, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, my potential gain is now $8,025.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,500, which is a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping that he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my potential gain is now $8,620.50.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the compromise, it's a fair deal""
}
```

I'm accepting the 55/45 split, as it's a relatively fair compromise, and I'd rather not risk going to the next round with a smaller potential gain."
