"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to keep 900,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This leaves room for negotiation later while giving Bob a small incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept.  This offer is still significantly better for me after inflation, and I believe it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is getting significantly worse for me, even with the inflation affecting Bob's share more. I'm still confident I can secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

While I am losing value due to inflation, I'm reducing my share slightly again. This should hopefully be enough to convince Bob to accept before we both start losing a lot of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than the previous one, I am still losing a significant amount due to inflation. I believe I can still get a better deal for myself in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This is a significant reduction for me, but I'm trying to close the deal before inflation eats away even more of my potential share."

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal share, I'm still losing a substantial amount due to inflation. I'm going to keep trying for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This is a big step for me, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to accept. We're both losing a lot of money with each passing round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
