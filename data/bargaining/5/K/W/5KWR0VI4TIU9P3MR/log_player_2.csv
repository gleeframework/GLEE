"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the rest. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept a 10% cut right off the bat! Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, Alice. That seems fair to me, considering the money will lose value with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 60/40 this time. Remember, the money is losing value faster for you than it is for me.  It's in your best interest to accept. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me. While I'd prefer a higher percentage, it's better to take what I can get before the money loses even more value."
