Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this goes on much longer. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. It's no longer worth holding out for a slightly larger share that will be significantly reduced by inflation. 
* **Risk of Losing Everything:**  If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable payout, even after inflation. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the decreasing value and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this."
