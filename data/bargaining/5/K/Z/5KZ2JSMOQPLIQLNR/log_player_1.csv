Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer to see if I can get the most value early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's tempting to hold out for a better deal, I'm not sure how much inflation will affect Bob's perception of value in the next round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least *some* money, whereas rejection means I'm at risk of getting nothing in the next round."
