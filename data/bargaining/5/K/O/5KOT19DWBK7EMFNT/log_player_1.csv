"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split. It's a little closer to even, and I'm sure we can reach a fair agreement in the next few rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less now due to inflation, I'm looking for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's try 50/50, it's a fair split and we can end the game now""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more even distribution of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finally end the game."
