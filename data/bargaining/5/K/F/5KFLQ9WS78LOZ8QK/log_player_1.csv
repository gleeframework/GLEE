"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a generous amount considering the risk of inflation. I'll get $8,000, which is a good starting point for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way we both get a good share and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. If we split the money evenly, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 10% less than the $8,000 I could have gotten in the first round. But at the same time, it's a more even split than my initial offer, and it avoids the risk of inflation affecting the value of the money further.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk I'm taking with this inflation. Let's meet in the middle and I'll give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a bit less than the $5,000 he offered in the previous round, but I'm trying to get a slightly better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still believe a fair split is important.  We can both benefit from this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'm not sure if I should accept it. My gain of $4,500 is worth 27.1% less than the $8,000 I could have gotten in the first round, and it's also less than the $6,000 I offered in the third round. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 14.26% less than the $2,000 he could have gotten in the first round, but it's also more than the $2,000 I offered initially.

I'm not convinced that this is the best deal for me, especially considering the risk of further inflation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still willing to make a fair offer. I'll give you a smaller share, but I need to prioritize my own gain to make up for the lost value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm trying to get a bigger share for myself to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair, but the inflation is hurting both of us.  Let's find a compromise where we both get a decent share and avoid getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting $6,000, which is worth 40.95% less than the $8,000 I could have gotten in the first round. However, it's a better deal than the $4,500 I would have gotten in the previous round, and it's still a decent share of the remaining money.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point.
