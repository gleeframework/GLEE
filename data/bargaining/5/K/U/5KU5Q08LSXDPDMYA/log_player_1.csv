  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us.  This way we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
