Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60-40 split in Bob's favor is fair, especially since I was the one making the proposal initially. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
