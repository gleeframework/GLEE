"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair offer, with me getting a slightly larger share, but it's a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll reject this offer since it's not in my favor.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time to make a new offer!

Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
