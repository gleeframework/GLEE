I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for future inflation to favor Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I still believe this is a fair offer given the inflation rate.  The remaining rounds are now more crucial for me, as my gains will shrink further with each passing turn."
