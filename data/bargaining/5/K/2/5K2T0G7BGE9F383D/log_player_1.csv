I'm going to try and get the most I can in the first round, but I'll be cautious about the inflation factor.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite, and this offer is a decent split. Accepting now ensures I get a significant amount, and avoids the risk of getting even less in future rounds."
