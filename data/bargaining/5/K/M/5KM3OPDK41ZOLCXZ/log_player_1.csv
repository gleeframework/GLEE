"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to make up for it. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the money is worth 5% less after the second round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, I'll think about this one... The money is really losing value quickly, so I'll try to get a bit more this time. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
