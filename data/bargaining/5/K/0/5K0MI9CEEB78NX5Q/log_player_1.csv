"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess if we don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for negotiations if we don't like this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle. Consider a slight skew towards me this round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll keep in mind that I'm giving up a bit more than I initially proposed. My gain of 300,000 is still a significant portion of the remaining amount, and I'm willing to compromise to move forward.
