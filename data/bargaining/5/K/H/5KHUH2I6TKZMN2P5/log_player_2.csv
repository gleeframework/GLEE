"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll see what I can do in the next round.  Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's fair considering the inflation we're facing. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm taking a smaller cut to account for the inflation, but your previous offer was too much. How about we settle for 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it.  It's a better deal than I had in round 1, and I don't want to risk losing even more money with inflation."
