"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering to give myself $800,000 and Bob $200,000. This is a 80/20 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new proposal, I'll have to think carefully about the inflation factor.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, this means that the effective split is not even. I'm getting a slightly larger share of the remaining money, which is not ideal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was a 50/50 split, I'll try to adjust my offer to be slightly more favorable to myself, considering the inflation factor.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

I'm offering myself $750,000 and Bob $250,000, which is a 75/25 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation factor, I notice that the effective split is now more in my favor, since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less.

However, I still think this offer is not bad for me, especially considering that the money I gain is still a significant amount. I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
