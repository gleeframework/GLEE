I'll start with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I initially proposed, the inflation is a serious threat, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances."
