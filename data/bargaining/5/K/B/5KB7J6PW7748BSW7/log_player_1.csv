"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose a near-even split in my favor, but leaving Bob with a small portion to incentivize accepting the deal.  As the rounds progress, the value of the money decreases, so I'd like to secure a larger share as soon as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all due to the limited rounds and potential for inflation to significantly impact my gains in later rounds."
