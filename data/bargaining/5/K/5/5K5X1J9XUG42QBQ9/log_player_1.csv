"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Given the inflation, I'm effectively getting $400,000, which is 40% of the original $1,000,000. That's a decent chunk, but I'm not sure I want to settle for less than 50%.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob might be trying to lowball me, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than 50% of the original amount, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting repetitive!

I notice that Bob's offer is the same as his offer in Round 2, but with a slight adjustment for inflation. I'm not sure if he's trying to lull me into a false sense of security or if he's genuinely trying to find a middle ground.

Considering the inflation, my effective gain in this offer would be around $324,000 (which is 32.4% of the original $1,000,000). It's not a bad deal, but I'm still not convinced that I'm getting the best possible outcome.

I'll reject this offer for now.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time to make my next move!

Given that Bob's offer was essentially the same as his previous one, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This time, I'm aiming for a 60-40 split, which is a bit more in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and we can wrap up the game."

Do you accept this offer?","Déjà vu!

I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to wear me down with the same offer, hoping I'll eventually accept it. But I'm not falling for it!

Considering the inflation, my effective gain in this offer would be around $240,000 (which is 24% of the original $1,000,000). It's a lowball offer, and I'm not willing to settle for it.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time to make another move!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
