"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that benefits me significantly, but still gives Bob a small share.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate or if he'll take what he can get!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my initial proposal, and I'm not sure how much more I can gain by rejecting it.  With inflation affecting Bob's share, I'm happy to take the 50/50 split."
