Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about time and inflation, but I still believe I can get a better deal. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my disadvantage with the inflation. While her offers are slowly getting better, accepting now would still mean losing a significant amount of money.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's stop wasting time.  I'm offering you the same deal as Round 2. Take it or leave it. We both need to walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Time pressure is mounting. Offering a repeat of a previous offer might signal I'm getting desperate.  It's a slight gamble, but the clock is ticking."
