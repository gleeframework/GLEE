"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I need to consider the value of the offer in terms of the original $10,000.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $8,000, which is equivalent to 80% of $10,000 (since 20% is lost to inflation). Bob will get $2,000, which is 20% of $10,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
