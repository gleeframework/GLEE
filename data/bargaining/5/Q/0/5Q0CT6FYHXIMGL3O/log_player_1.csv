Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more equitable split is possible considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, reflecting the slightly slower depreciation of my money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
