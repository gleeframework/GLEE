Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob agrees with my proposal. 90 dollars for me seems like a fair deal, but I might have to lower my expectations in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a risky move, but I believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can convince Bob to give me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and I think it's more likely to be accepted than my previous offer."
