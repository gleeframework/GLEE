"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that I take $9,000 and Bob takes $1,000.  I'm aiming for a big share early on, as the money will be worth less each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I wanted to get a larger share, the inflation is a serious factor. Taking $5,000 now is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
