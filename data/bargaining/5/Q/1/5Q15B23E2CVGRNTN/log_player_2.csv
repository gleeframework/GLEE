Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my higher inflation rate. Even though the offer seems tempting as time goes on, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting a 44/56 split at this stage would be a significant loss compared to what we could have gotten earlier."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is it - a final offer for a 50/50 split.  Take it before inflation eats away at the value even more for both of us!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Alice is clearly stalling and hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress. Offering a 50/50 split is perfectly fair, and the ""final offer"" message adds a sense of urgency.  While I'm losing value faster,  she also loses something with every round. Hopefully, this convinces her to accept before we both lose out."
