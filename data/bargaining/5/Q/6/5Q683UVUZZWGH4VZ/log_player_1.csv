"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a 40% share. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more for my part in this negotiation. Let's see if you'll budge. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of the money, and now I'd be gaining 285,000 (300,000 x 0.95). Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm willing to consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 5% inflation. Now the money is worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. This way, you'll get a 58% share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still holding firm on the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the percentage, but I'm willing to give you a smaller amount. You're not getting a free ride! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken a bigger bite this time, and now I'd be gaining 255,000 (250,000 x 0.95^3). Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, and I'm not willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal. I'm not going to give in to this offer."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 462000,
  ""bob_gain"": 538000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a 53.8% share, Bob. This is my best offer so far. Let's meet in the middle.""

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a bigger and bigger bite. Now the money is worth 0.77^5 = 0.3888 of its original value, and I'd be gaining only 154,400 (200,000 x 0.77^5). Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.

However, I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to give in yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really taking its toll now. The money is worth 0.3888 of its original value, and I'd be gaining only 154,400 (200,000 x 0.77^5) if I accepted Bob's offer in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a 62% share, Bob. I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up yet. Let's try to find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going."
