"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a fair split at the moment, I can likely get a better deal for myself by seeing what Alice's strategy is and taking advantage of the inflation that affects her more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but I want a bit more than a fair split this time. Let's see if you're willing to compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I offered her in the previous round. While the inflation is starting to take a bite, it's still in my best interest to accept."
