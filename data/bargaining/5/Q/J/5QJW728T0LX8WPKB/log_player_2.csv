"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm taking a bigger risk with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation rates.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. This back and forth is just hurting us both. 50/50 is the only fair outcome. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think 50/50 is a fair outcome, considering the inflation rates and the fact that we're both losing value with each passing round. It's better to settle now than to continue negotiating and losing more value."
