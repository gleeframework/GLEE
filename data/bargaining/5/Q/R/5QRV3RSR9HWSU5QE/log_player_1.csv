Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking a worse offer in the next round. Here's why:

* **Bob's diminishing returns:**  Inflation is hitting Bob harder. While he's getting more of the nominal amount, its actual value to him is decreasing. This makes him more likely to offer a better deal for me in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob offering even less in Round 5.  The potential gain from rejecting isn't worth the risk of getting a much worse deal.
* **Present Value:** A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Getting $4500 now is better than potentially getting slightly more later, especially since my purchasing power isn't affected by inflation in this scenario."
