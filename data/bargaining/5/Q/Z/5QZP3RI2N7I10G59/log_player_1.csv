{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with Bob taking a larger share, especially since the money is already worth 5% less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit concerned about the value of the money decreasing with each round, and Bob's offers are getting more and more one-sided. I'm not comfortable with taking only $3,500 while Bob gets $6,500. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really struggling to accept an offer that gives me only $3,000 while Bob gets $7,000. The decreasing value of the money is making it harder for me to make ends meet, and I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
