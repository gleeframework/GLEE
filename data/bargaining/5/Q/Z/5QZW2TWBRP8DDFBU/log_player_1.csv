"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm hoping to get more in the next round! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, $300,000 is only worth $240,000 to me now. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth $630,000 to him, which is a significant advantage.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.
