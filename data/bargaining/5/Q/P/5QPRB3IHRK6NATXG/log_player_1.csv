"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split this time, but I hope we can make it a bit more even next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think a 40-60 split is fair, Bob. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
