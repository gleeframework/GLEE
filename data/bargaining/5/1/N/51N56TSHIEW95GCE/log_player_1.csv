"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I need to reassess the proposal. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 40/60 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll propose a slightly more skewed split to account for the reduced value. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}"
