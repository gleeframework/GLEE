"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll get $500,000 and Bob will get $500,000. This is a fair and simple start to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm looking for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it.

After some thought, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit low, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, where I'll get $700,000 and Bob will get $300,000. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still gives Bob a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing it too far, Alice. I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting pretty aggressive! I'm not thrilled about the 1:9 split, and the fact that I'm only getting $100,000 is really low.

However, I'm trying to be strategic and think about the bigger picture. If I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing if we run out of rounds. So, I'll decide to...
