"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. Fair deal, right? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem favorable enough, considering the impact of inflation on both our gains. Let's proceed and see if we can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the impact of inflation on both our gains. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'll aim for a more favorable split.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's aim for a more balanced split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go 50/50 this time.  I think we both need to be more flexible to avoid losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, a 50/50 split at this point seems reasonable. The money is worth 19% less for me and 36% less for Alice compared to the first round, so accepting this offer now minimizes further loss due to inflation. It's a fair compromise."
