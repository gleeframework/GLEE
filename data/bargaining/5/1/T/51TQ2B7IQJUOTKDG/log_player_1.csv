"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll reassess the offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll consider the effective gains as follows:

My gain: 400000 / 0.8 = 500000 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: 600000 / 0.9 = 666666.67 (due to 10% inflation)

Considering the effective gains, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
