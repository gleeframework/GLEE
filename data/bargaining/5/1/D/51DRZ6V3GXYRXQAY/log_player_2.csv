Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Reasoning:

Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game continues, the less Bob's potential gains are worth due to inflation. Accepting now secures a payout that's still significant, even with the inflation factored in. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently offered splits favoring her, with only minor concessions.  Her latest message indicates she's unlikely to budge much more, especially given the pressure is primarily on Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk.  Future rounds might see Alice offering even less favorable splits, leaving Bob with a much smaller portion or nothing at all if the 12 rounds expire. 

Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now guarantees a decent payout, while rejecting it gambles on securing a slightly better deal against the very real possibility of walking away with nothing.
