Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer a generous 9000 for myself and 1000 for Bob.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, 5000 is better than the 7200 I'd get if I rejected and proposed my own offer. It's a fair split for both of us."
