"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and have room to negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's try to find a better deal from here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
