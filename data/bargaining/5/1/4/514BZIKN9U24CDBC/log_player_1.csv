"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 20$ later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer given that I'm the first to make the proposal. The message is a hint that I'm willing to be flexible and consider splitting the remaining amount later, but I'm starting with a strong offer to set the tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I need to consider that Bob's offer is actually worth 5% less than what it seems.

Since Bob's offer is 60/40, and considering the inflation, I calculate the actual values as follows:

* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.95 (since it's worth 5% less) = 57
* Alice's gain: 40 (no change)

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to 50/50, but still in my favor. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's split the remaining 5$ later""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 ratio, which is a bit more balanced than my initial offer, but still in my favor. The message is a hint that I'm willing to compromise and split the remaining amount later, but I'm not giving up my advantage just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations, just fairness 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation factor, I calculate the actual values of Bob's offer as follows:

* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.8574 (since it's worth 14.26% less) = 42.87
* Alice's gain: 50 (no change)

Since the offer is 50/50, and considering the inflation, I think this is a relatively fair deal. I'll decide to accept it.
