Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nLet me know what Bob says!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but 10% less for Bob, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. I initially offered a 55-45 split, and now Bob is offering an even split. I can try to counteroffer or wait for a better proposal in the next rounds, considering the inflation will continue to affect Bob's gains."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but let's make a deal before the inflation gets too high. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Bob's offer of a 45-55 split is less favorable to me than my initial offer of a 55-45 split. Considering the inflation has no effect on my gains but significantly impacts Bob's, I can afford to wait for a better proposal. The fact that Bob is willing to give me a bit more indicates there's room for negotiation. I'll hold out for a better deal, given that time is on my side due to the uneven impact of inflation."

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. We're losing money with each round, and it's better to take something than nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Despite Bob's claim that this is his final offer, the fact that inflation continues to devalue his share while mine remains unaffected puts me in a strong negotiating position. Bob's offer of a 40-60 split is even less favorable than his previous one, suggesting he might be trying to bluff. Given that we still have several rounds left and the pressure of inflation is on Bob, I'll reject this offer in anticipation of a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""You said that was your final offer, but I think you can do better considering the circumstances""}\n\nLet me know what Bob says!"

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk here, but I believe this is the best chance we have to reach an agreement. Let's not let inflation completely destroy our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Bob's offer of a 35-65 split is even more skewed in his favor than before, despite the increasing impact of inflation on his share. Given that his gains are now worth more than 50% less than in the first round, while mine remain unaffected, I see no reason to accept a worse deal. Bob's message suggests desperation, and I believe he will be more willing to compromise as the rounds progress and inflation further erodes his potential gains. I'll continue to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation is significantly impacting your share, and we're running out of time. I think this is a fair offer considering the circumstances""}\n\nLet me know what Bob says!"

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. We're running out of time, and I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Despite Bob's claim that this is his final offer and his willingness to take a slightly smaller share, the proposed 30-70 split is still heavily skewed in his favor. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, which is now worth more than 60% less than in the first round, I find this offer unacceptable. With only a couple of rounds left, I'll continue to press for a better deal, as Bob's desperation and the effects of inflation should force him to reconsider his position."
