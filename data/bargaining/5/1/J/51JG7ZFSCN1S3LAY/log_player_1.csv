"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a small share, but I'm taking the majority! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject this offer. I don't want to accept such a small share, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing over time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking too long, let's move on! I'll give you 300k, that's the best I can do!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a significant concession on my part."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still the one making the offer! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the value of money decreasing by 14.26%, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll have to accept this offer. I'm not happy with the 25% share, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value.
