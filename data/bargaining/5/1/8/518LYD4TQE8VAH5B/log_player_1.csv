"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000 and take $8000. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2000 and keeping $8000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3200 (20% of 16000 is 3200, but I started with 8000, so it's 3200)
* Bob gain: 6000

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take $4500 and I'll take $5500. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: 3200 (48.8% of 6600 is 3200, but I started with 8000, so it's 3200)
* Bob gain: 4620 (14.26% of 6500 is 926.5, but Bob started with 2000, so it's 4620)

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's getting closer to what I want. I'll decide to accept it.
