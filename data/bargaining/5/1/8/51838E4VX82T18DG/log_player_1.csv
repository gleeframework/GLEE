"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself, emphasizing the fairness of this initial split. This division gives me a slight advantage but still offers Bob a substantial amount, considering the total sum. As the game progresses and inflation affects the value of the money, the pressure to accept an offer increases for both of us, but more so for Bob due to the higher rate of depreciation on his end. This initial offer sets a baseline for negotiations, aiming to find a mutually acceptable division before the value of the money drops too significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although splitting the money evenly seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation rates, Bob's half is worth 10% less than it was in the first round, while mine is only worth 5% less. Given this disparity in depreciation, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next rounds, leveraging the fact that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob. This strategic decision aims to maximize my gain, taking into account the different rates of inflation affecting our shares."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is fairer.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself, explaining that considering the inflation, this division is actually fairer than an even split. Given that the value of the money decreases more rapidly for Bob, his $4200 in this round is worth less than it would have been in the initial round. This adjustment aims to reflect the changing value of the money while still presenting Bob with a considerable offer, hoping he will accept before the depreciation impacts both our potential gains further."
