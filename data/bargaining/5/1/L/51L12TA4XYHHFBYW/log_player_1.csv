"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair start. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split this time. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new one.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more. I'll take 70 and you can have 30.""}

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent share. Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 75 is too much. How about 35 for me and 65 for you? 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. But I still don't want to give up too much. I'll accept Bob's offer, but only because I think I can get a better deal later.
