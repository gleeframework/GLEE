I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round, aiming for 90% of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial proposal, and while I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, I'm not going to give in so easily. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm still aiming for a significant share, but I'm acknowledging the inflation factor and reducing my initial demand by $500.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to reach an agreement before the money depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable, and the inflation is starting to hit hard. I'm not willing to settle for such a small share just yet. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

Inflation is becoming a serious issue, and I need to be more realistic. I'm offering a much more balanced deal, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. This should be enough to incentivize Bob to accept, especially with the rising inflation."
