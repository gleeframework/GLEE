"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the money equally, with no room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more, huh?

I'll think about it... With the money being worth 10% less, I'd rather have a slightly smaller share now than risk waiting for a better deal that might not come.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
