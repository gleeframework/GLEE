Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to split it 50/50. That's a fair offer, considering the stakes.
