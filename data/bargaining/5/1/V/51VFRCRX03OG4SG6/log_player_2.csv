Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm also aware of the inflation! Hope you see it my way. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is being incredibly greedy, and this is just the first round. I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me such a small percentage of the money. There's a lot of game left, and I'm confident I can get a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
