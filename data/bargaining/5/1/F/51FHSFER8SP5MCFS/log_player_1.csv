I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both have to deal with inflation.  Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think 45 is a bit low for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
