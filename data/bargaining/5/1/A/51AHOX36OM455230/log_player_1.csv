Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking 9000$ and giving Bob 1000$. I figure this is a good starting point, as it leaves me with the majority of the money, but still gives Bob a small amount to hopefully convince him to accept.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer to have more, I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation.  5000 is a decent amount and I'm willing to take it."
