Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm being patient, but I won't wait forever! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I need to hold firm for a bit longer. The rate of inflation is hurting, but accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is not a winning strategy in the long run."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be fair. 50/50, and we both walk away with something.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but not quite there! 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really starting to bite now. While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, getting 46% of the pot now is better than risking getting nothing in a few rounds, or being forced to accept an even worse deal later. Alice knows time is on her side, so I need to cut my losses and take this offer."
