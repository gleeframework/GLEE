"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'll let Bob know that we're starting with a fair and equal division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is now worth 36 (90% of 40).

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I think I deserve more than 36. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my offer will be worth 9% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I still want a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving Bob a slightly bigger share than before, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's fair considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 35 is now worth 36.65 (since 100 - 27.1% = 72.9%, and 72.9% of 35 is 25.61, but due to the rounding of the original offer, it is actually 36.65).

I'm not convinced that this offer is fair, considering the inflation rate is affecting me more than Bob. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my offer will be worth 72.9% of the original amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, giving Bob a bigger share, but keeping a significant portion for myself."
