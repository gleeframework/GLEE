"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm starting with a relatively fair split, but I'm taking a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering we both have equal bargaining power. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'll try to get a slightly better split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway and offer a 50/50 split. Let's compromise and end this game.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more equal distribution of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
