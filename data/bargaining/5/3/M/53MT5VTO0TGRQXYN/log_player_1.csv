"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair split, let's start with""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given the value of money is likely to decrease. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'm willing to consider it.
