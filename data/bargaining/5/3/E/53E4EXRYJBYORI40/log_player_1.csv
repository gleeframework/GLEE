"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively even split, considering I'm the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was hoping to get a better deal. Since I'm the one who made the first offer, I was expecting a slightly better split. Additionally, considering the inflation effect, I think I can do better than a 50/50 split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this one, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I believe a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I appreciate the slight advantage he's offering, I'm still not satisfied with the 45/55 split. Considering the inflation effect, I think I can do better than this. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 58/42 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob will accept, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation."
