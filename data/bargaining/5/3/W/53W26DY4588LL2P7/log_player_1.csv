"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, it's a fair proposal. Considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, and this offer seems reasonable.
