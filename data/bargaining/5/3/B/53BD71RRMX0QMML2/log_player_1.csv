I propose a 99/1 split, taking the majority and giving Bob a small amount. I figure this is a good starting point, and he might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I would gain something, I am still losing a significant amount due to inflation. I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering a 90/10 split, taking 90% for myself. I'm reducing my initial demand, but still leaving a significant portion for Bob.  This should be more attractive to him, especially since I'm losing money to inflation with each round."
