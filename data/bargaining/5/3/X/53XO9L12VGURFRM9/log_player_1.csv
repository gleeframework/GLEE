"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a 20% bite out of my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is 50/50, which is a significant concession from his initial rejection. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
