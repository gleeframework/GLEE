"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can both walk away with a good amount.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount. This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
