"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm offering a split that is heavily in my favor, as I have the first move and know that inflation will work against me in the later rounds. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob a small incentive to accept while ensuring a good share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is not a good deal for me, I have to accept it.  Inflation is working against me, and if I reject this offer, I risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
