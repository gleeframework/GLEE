"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'd get $6,000 and Bob would get $4,000. The message is just a friendly message to Bob, but the real goal is to get the best deal I can!"

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500
