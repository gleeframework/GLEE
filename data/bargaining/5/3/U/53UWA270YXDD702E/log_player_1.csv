"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is $4,000, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get $6,000, but for Bob, the money is worth 5% less, so he's offering me $6,300.

However, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that's not even better than my initial offer. I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70% and I rejected it, I'll try to increase my share. I'll offer 55% to myself and 45% to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get $5,500, but for Bob, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so he's offering me $4,350.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually worse than my previous offer, which was $4,500. I'm not sure why he's not budging.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get closer to my desired 60% share. I'll offer 58% to myself and 42% to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about making a deal... 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get $6,000, but for Bob, the money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so he's offering me $3,800.

I'm not sure why Bob is pushing for a 60-40 split, but I'll try to meet him halfway. I'll accept this offer.
