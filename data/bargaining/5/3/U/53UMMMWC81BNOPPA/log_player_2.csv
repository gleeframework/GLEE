"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  I'll take less than my initial offer, but 70/30 is still fair given the inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. With inflation, we both lose more with each round, so a 50/50 split is the most logical way to end this.""}
