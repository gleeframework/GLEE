I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I believe it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}
```

I'm offering a slightly more even split this time, recognizing that we both need to compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is still significant, Bob's share continues to increase.  I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}
```

I'm offering a split that's closer to Bob's previous offer, but still gives me a reasonable share.  This round has a significant inflation impact, so I need to make sure I get something substantial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is significantly worse for me than my previous proposal. I'm still willing to negotiate, but Bob's offer is simply too lopsided."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}
```

With significant inflation, I'm lowering my ask.  This offer acknowledges the need to compromise and keep the game going."
