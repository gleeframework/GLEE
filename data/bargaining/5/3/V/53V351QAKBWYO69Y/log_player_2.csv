"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I understand you want to split evenly, but I'm facing inflation. How about a slightly better deal for me this time?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a bit, but I still need a decent share.  How about we split it 51/49 this time? 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is eating away at my share.  I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still holding firm on my share. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reason: While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds as inflation continues to eat away at Bob's potential gains.
