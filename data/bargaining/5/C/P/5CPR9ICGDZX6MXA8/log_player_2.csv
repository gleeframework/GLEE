Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 50-50, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a slightly biased deal.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. Alice's offer is still a bit biased towards her, but it's closer to 50-50 than my previous offer. I'll take it.
