Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I make the first move next round, and with inflation, we both lose out if this drags on. Take the decent offer while you can. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to be bullied into accepting a bad deal. I'm confident I can get a better offer in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and this back and forth is helping no one. I'm compromising here. Let's close this deal and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not convinced this is a fair deal. I believe we can find a more equitable split, and with inflation working in my favor, I'm confident I can secure a better offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair share. This offer takes into account the inflation affecting your earnings, while still leaving you with a substantial amount. Let's find a middle ground and end this game amicably.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking with a 50/50 split. This is non-negotiable. Accept now, or the effects of inflation will hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with a 50/50 split, given the rapidly declining value of Bob's money due to inflation, accepting this offer seems like the best option. It avoids further losses for both of us and ensures we at least get something."
