"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 
I propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair and we both get a good amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with this offer. I'd rather take my chances with a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'll offer Bob 45 dollars and keep 55 for myself. Since we're both losing money each round, I think it's important to start negotiating towards a slightly more favorable split for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a more even split, this offer is better than the previous one, and we're losing a significant amount of money with each round.  I'll accept."
