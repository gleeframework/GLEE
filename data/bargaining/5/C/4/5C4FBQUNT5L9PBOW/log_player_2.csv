I'll reject this offer, Alice. While I understand the pressure of the shrinking value, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal for myself by continuing the negotiations."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day before we both lose out significantly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is right, this is getting out of hand.  I'll accept the even split, even though it's less than I initially hoped for.  It's better than risking losing everything."
