I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he wants to bargain, I'm ready for the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is much worse than my initial offer, and I know I can get a better deal if we keep playing.  I'm going to reject this offer and see what he comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a good share, but I'm adjusting my offer slightly to be more reasonable. Bob likely knows the inflation is hitting him harder than me. If I go too high, he might just keep rejecting offers, and I'm not sure how high the inflation will go. Let's see if he'll bite this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While the inflation is affecting him, he is still getting the larger portion of the money.  I'm going to keep pushing for a fairer split. I'm not sure what the next round's inflation rate will be, but I'm willing to gamble on it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, but not as drastically as before. The inflation is still impacting Bob more than me, and I want to keep the pressure on. I think this offer is fair considering the circumstances, but I'm ready to keep negotiating if he wants to play it out."
