"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to set a baseline for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still keeping a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider the value of the money I gain in the next round to be worth 95% of the initial amount.

Since I was initially offered 5000, and the money I gain is worth 95% of the initial amount, I'll consider the equivalent value in the second round to be 5000 * 0.95 = 4750.

Bob's offer is 4000, which is less than the equivalent value of 4750. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still taking a bit more. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split in my favor, but still keeping it relatively close to a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. You can try to do better if you want. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the money I gain in the fourth round. Since I was initially offered 5000, and the money I gain is worth 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of the initial amount, I'll consider the equivalent value in the fourth round to be 5000 * 0.8574 = 4291.

Bob's offer is 4800, which is more than the equivalent value of 4291. I'll accept this offer.
