**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is not ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal, even if Bob were to eventually concede slightly.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixated on getting at least a 50/50 split, and he's betting I'll crack under the pressure of inflation. 
* **Initial Offer:** Accepting now gets me the same amount I initially proposed. While it's not ideal due to the round delay and inflation, it prevents me from getting locked into an even worse deal in the future."
