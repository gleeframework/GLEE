Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. This is my new price. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the impact of inflation is severe.  While ideally, I'd like a larger share, accepting Alice's offer nets me something. If I reject her offer and propose a counter-offer in Round 6, the value of my share will decrease even further due to inflation. It's a tough decision, but taking the sure bet at this stage is the most rational choice."
