"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory problem where the optimal strategy is to be as greedy as possible in the first round. Since I don't know how inflation impacts Bob, I'm maximizing my gain, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to accept this offer. While the money is worth the same for me as in the first round, I don't know how the inflation affects Bob. If I reject this offer, there's a chance he might offer me even less in the next round, due to the inflation affecting his share.  Therefore, accepting the 50/50 split is the more sensible option."
