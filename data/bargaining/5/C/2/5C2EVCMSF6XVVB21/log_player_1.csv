"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can split the remaining 200,000 in the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, it's a fair split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial offer would be equivalent to 640,000 in the second round, but I didn't make an offer in the second round. Now, I have to decide on Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
