"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is $20. I'll get the remaining 80%. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no more, no less 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 is now worth 90% of the original 50, which is $45.

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of the original value (90% of 90% = 81%). I'll keep that in mind.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the remaining $100, which is $40. I'll get the remaining 60%. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob is willing to give me a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you less, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

With the inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 72.9% of the original 80% (27.1% less than 90% of 90% = 72.9% of 80%). That's a significant decrease.

I'll think about Bob's new offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as the inflation has reduced my gain significantly, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even smaller share."
