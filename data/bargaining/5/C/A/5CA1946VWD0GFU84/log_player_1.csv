"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. The message is just a friendly nudge to get the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $900,000 I would get in the second round is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $810,000. I'm not sure what the value of Bob's offer is in the first round, but I can see that he's proposing a 50/50 split in the second round.

I'll consider the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if the 50/50 split is fair considering the value of the money is decreasing, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 90% of the value in the second round, so my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 72/28 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a compromise."
