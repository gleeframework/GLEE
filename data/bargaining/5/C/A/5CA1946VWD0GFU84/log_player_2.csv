Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You can do better than that! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. 
# Bob gain: 280000 
# Alice gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice has lowered her asking price, and I'm willing to accept a slightly lower share to secure the money. I'm not sure what the inflation rate means for future rounds, so I'll take this offer."
