"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll receive 570,000$ (600,000 * 0.95).

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a 50/50 split, and I'd rather have a guaranteed 570,000$ than risk waiting for a better offer.
