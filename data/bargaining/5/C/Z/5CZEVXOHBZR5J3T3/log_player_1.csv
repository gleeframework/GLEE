 I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as the first mover,  I want to secure a large portion of the money before inflation kicks in."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm willing to lower my demands slightly, but I still want a significant share.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm trying to find a compromise that still favors me but is more likely to be accepted."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm still holding out for a better deal. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial demand, I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable split, especially considering the inflation impacting Bob's share."

Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm willing to compromise further, but I still want a significant share.  The inflation is hitting Bob harder, and I believe I can secure a more favorable deal by offering a slightly lower split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial demand. The inflation is significantly impacting Bob's share, and it's unlikely he'll offer more in the next round. It's time to accept and secure a decent split."
