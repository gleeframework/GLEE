"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my first proposal.  I'll reject it and make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'll lower my share to $8,000 and increase Bob's to $2,000.  I'm still accounting for inflation, but trying to be more reasonable to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy! This offer is much worse than my last one. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable share. I'll offer Bob $3,000, which is more than his last offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also protecting my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still pushing for a lopsided deal.  I won't accept this offer, even with the decreasing value of money.  I'm not willing to settle for a deal this bad, and I'm hoping he'll come around to a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to increase Bob's share again to $4,000, which is a significant compromise given the value of the money is continuing to decrease.  I'm hoping this will finally show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, and we can reach an agreement before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair.  Even though the money is losing value, I'm not willing to settle for an agreement where I receive less than half. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The value of the money is plummeting, and I'm running out of time.  To avoid getting nothing at all, I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the fairest solution given the current circumstances, and I hope Bob will finally accept it."
