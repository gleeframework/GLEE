"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the risk of inflation.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$, which is 70, and Bob gets 30% or 30$."
