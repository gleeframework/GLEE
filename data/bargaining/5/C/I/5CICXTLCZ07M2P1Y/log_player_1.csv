"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share Alice, but this needs to be more equitable.  This is my counter offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a better deal for me than your last offer, and it still gets us both a decent amount before inflation eats away at it.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer considering the inflation.  We need to reach an agreement soon! 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still heavily weighted in his favor considering the impact of inflation on my potential earnings. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if I can secure a slightly better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, and inflation is hurting me.  This offer is a compromise - meet me in the middle!"" 
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this now.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is the best I'm likely to achieve at this point.  The increasing impact of inflation means every round makes the potential winnings less appealing. Accepting ensures I at least get a reasonable share, whereas holding out risks getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in time."
