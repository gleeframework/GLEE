I'm offering to take 9000 and give Bob 1000. This should be a pretty good deal for both of us, especially since the money is worth less to Bob in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
