"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'm getting 60 and Bob is getting 40. This is a slightly better deal for me than the 50-50 split in the first round, but I'm not sure if I should take it. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60-40, and the money is worth 10% less for him, I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself this time. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Your turn again, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'm getting 62 and Bob is getting 38. Considering the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob, this offer is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal. I'll take it!
