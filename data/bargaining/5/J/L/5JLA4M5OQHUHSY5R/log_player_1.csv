"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk to keep the game interesting.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is 30% of the initial amount, and keeping $7,000 for myself, which is 70% of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it closer to the middle. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $7,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $5,600. Bob's offer of $4,000 is 40% of the new amount, and his gain of $6,000 is 60% of the new amount.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer, I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (20% in the first round and another 20% in the second round), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slight edge given my previous offer.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 48% share for myself and a 52% share for Bob, which is a slightly more favorable split for me."
