I'm proposing a split where I'll take $4,500 and Bob will take $5,500. This is a slightly more generous offer than my initial 50/50 proposal, but I'm still trying to keep the gap between our gains relatively small."

After careful consideration, I'll reject this offer. I don't think I can afford to give Bob almost all of the money, especially when the money is worth so much less.
