"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split.  Let's go 60-40. We can get more in the long run if we both agree to be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'm not sure if a 60-40 split is reasonable, considering the initial proposal was 80-20. However, I'm willing to consider a more even split. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45. A fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly more even split, but still prioritizing my gain."
