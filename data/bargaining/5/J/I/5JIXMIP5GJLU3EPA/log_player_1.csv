I'm going for a large share, but still leaving Bob with something.  It's the first round, and I want to see if he's willing to negotiate.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While Bob's proposal is a significant shift in power, I believe I can still get a better deal. The inflation is hurting me more, but I'm willing to gamble that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer is a compromise.  I'm reducing my share to 6000, which is still more than Bob offered me, but a significant reduction from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, considering the inflation is now affecting him as well.  Let's see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's clear that inflation is heavily impacting my potential gains, I'm not ready to accept such a drastic reduction in my share.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds and see if I can secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  The inflation is hitting both of us hard now, and I think this is the most fair way to divide the remaining money.  It's a chance for both of us to walk away with something, and avoids further risk of getting nothing at all.  Let's see if Bob agrees."
