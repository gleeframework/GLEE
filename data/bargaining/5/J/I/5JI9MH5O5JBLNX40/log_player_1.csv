"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, as it's a fair and simple way to divide the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you get 40. Fair enough? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less for both of us, but I'd rather get something than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
