I propose taking 990,000 and giving Bob 10,000. This is a pretty good deal for me, and it's a chance for Bob to get something. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While it's a lot more than he offered before, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000, which is still a substantial amount. Since inflation has hit my side harder, I need to take a larger share to make sure I'm not losing too much. I hope this offer is reasonable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. While the inflation has taken a toll, getting an even split in this round is a good outcome for me. I'm not sure I can do better, so I'll take it."
