"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I think it's a good way to begin our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% this time, let's see if you'll take 40% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob 60% of the total amount. I think I can do better than that. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if you'll take this offer.""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a balance and not give away too much."
