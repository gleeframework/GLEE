"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but this is a one-time offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to take a measly 100,000 when I know I can get more!  Let's see what Alice has to offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. I'm willing to give you a good share, but I want a larger cut considering the inflation.  This is my best offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer more, I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation.  Taking 400,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
