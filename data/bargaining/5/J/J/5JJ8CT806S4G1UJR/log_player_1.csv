Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to maximize my gains while making sure Bob at least gets something to avoid immediate rejection.  It's a gamble, but I'm betting that he'll want to see if he can do better in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, it's unlikely Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round due to the inflation.  Accepting this 50/50 split is the safest move."
