"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I'm trying to be generous, but also want to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but not that generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 70$ gain is now worth only 56$ (70 * 0.8). That's a bit stingy, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
