Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a strong opening offer, but leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is a real threat. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and I'm not confident I'll be able to negotiate better in the next rounds."
