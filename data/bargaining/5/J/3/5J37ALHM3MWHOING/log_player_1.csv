"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the initial $10,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a compromise to try to get Bob to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly.  Let's end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to split the money evenly, but his proposal is actually quite generous for me, considering the inflation rates.

I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $4,000 and Bob will take $6,000. It's a fair split, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement!"
