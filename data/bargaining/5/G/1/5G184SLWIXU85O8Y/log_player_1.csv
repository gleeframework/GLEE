"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to be fair Alice, but the value decreases for me each round.  This is more equitable long term. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is literally money Alice - we both lose if we don't agree soon. This offer reflects the urgency. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offer is still not good for me. I need to hold firm to get a better deal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to demonstrate I won't be lowballed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a reasonable compromise considering the time pressure. We both need to benefit. Let's close this deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're past the halfway point! I'm taking a hit with each refusal.  This needs to end now, and this is my best and final offer. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting really desperate, calling this his ""best and final offer."" I think he's bluffing and the time pressure is getting to him more than to me. I need to stand firm and offer a deal that's barely acceptable to him, but only in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we both overplayed our hands. Let's split this evenly and call it a day.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're past the halfway point and Bob is getting very anxious. Now is the time to appear reasonable and offer a 50/50 split.  This might seem like I'm being generous, but with the inflation working against him, it's probably the best he can hope for at this stage. It also avoids the risk of us both getting nothing."
