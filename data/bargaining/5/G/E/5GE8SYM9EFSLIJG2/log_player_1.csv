"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. This is a reasonable starting point, and it's a fair offer considering we're just starting the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a larger share of the money. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept such a drastic difference in the split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a fair deal""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some buffer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The inflation is making the money worth less and less, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'm trying to get a better deal, but Bob's offers are still too skewed in his favor. I'll wait for his next offer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle again, with a fair split""}

I'm going back to my initial idea of a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in meeting in the middle and accepting a fair deal."
