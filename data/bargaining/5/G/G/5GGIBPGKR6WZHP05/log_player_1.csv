"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation and the possibility of getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best choice. The inflation is biting hard, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
