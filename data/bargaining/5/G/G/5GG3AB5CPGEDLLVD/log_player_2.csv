"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me after the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money I gain due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, and I was offered 5500 in the second round, I should be cautious about accepting an offer that's lower than that.

However, Alice is offering a higher amount than she did in the second round, which suggests she's trying to make a more generous offer. Considering the reduced value of the money I gain, I'll accept this offer.
