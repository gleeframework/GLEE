{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to propose a 900,000/100,000 split.  I figure this is a good starting point, giving me a large share while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer to 800,000/200,000. Since Bob is clearly aiming for a bigger share, I need to offer him a little more to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to continue raising my offer, but I'm getting closer to his demands. 700,000/300,000 feels like a good compromise considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000

I'm still not happy with this offer. While it's getting closer, I still believe I can get a better deal, especially since the inflation is starting to bite."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to 600,000/400,000. We're running out of time, and I need to reach a compromise."
