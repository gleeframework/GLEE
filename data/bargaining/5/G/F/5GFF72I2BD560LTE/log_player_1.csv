"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the initial $100, and keeping $60 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. With the inflation, my gain of $30 is equivalent to $33 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I think I'll reject it. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% inflation that has occurred so far. Since the money is worth 90% of its original value, I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to keep a bigger share to account for inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. With the inflation, my gain of $40 is equivalent to $57.14 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I think I'll accept it. It's not the best deal I've had so far, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting a worse deal.
