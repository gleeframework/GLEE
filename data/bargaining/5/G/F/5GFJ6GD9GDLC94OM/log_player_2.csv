"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split.  I'm feeling generous, but I want to make sure I get the lion's share!  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite greedy.  Let's be reasonable. I propose a 65/35 split.  This reflects that we are both contributing to this windfall."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, let's be fair.  I'm willing to split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good share and we don't need to keep playing this game.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice's offer is now fair and reasonable. Accepting ensures I get a good share, and avoids the risk of further inflation decreasing the value for both of us."
