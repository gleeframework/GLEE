"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that suggests this is a fair division. Since the money loses value over rounds, I'm trying to be somewhat generous to incentivize Bob to accept early, but still aiming to get the larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This seems more balanced considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a better share. The fact that the money loses more value for Bob than for me gives me some leverage. I'm hoping that in the next round, I can propose a division that is more favorable to me, or at least not as skewed in Bob's favor as this one. Let's proceed to the next round and see how it goes!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, where my gain is worth 10% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than the initial amount, I'm adjusting my offer to still favor me but in a way that acknowledges the decreasing value of the money. By proposing a 58-42 split, I'm trying to find a balance that Bob might accept, considering that further rounds will only decrease the value of the money further. Let's see if Bob agrees with my assessment of what's fair at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, especially for Bob, this offer seems relatively reasonable at this stage. The difference in our gains is minimal, and given that further rounds will only continue to devalue the money, I believe it's wise to accept this offer rather than risking an even less favorable outcome in the future. It seems like Bob is not willing to compromise further, as indicated by the ""take it or leave it"" message. Therefore, accepting this offer appears to be the best course of action.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
