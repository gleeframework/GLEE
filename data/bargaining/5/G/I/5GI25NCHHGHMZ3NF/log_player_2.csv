# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is using tricky language to mask that she's offering me even less value than before.  I need to push for a better split before inflation eats away my potential gains."

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is preying on my fear of inflation, but this is still a bad deal. I need to remain firm and try for a better outcome."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Every round you wait, your share loses more value. Take this offer before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one. Alice is using scare tactics, and she's not wrong about the inflation. However, accepting this offer would mean losing almost half the value of my initial potential gain. I'm betting Alice will be more open to a fairer split as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, we both lose if we don't reach a deal. This is my final offer. It's better for you to take a slight advantage than risk getting nothing at all.""}

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time and value. This is my final offer. Accept it or risk getting nothing 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a difficult decision, but time is running out. Alice is clearly taking a hard line and knows the pressure I'm under due to the inflation.  While this offer is much less than I wanted, rejecting it carries the significant risk of getting nothing at all if Alice is unwilling to budge."
