"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, and I'm looking to gain more, I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more skewed towards me. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger hit on Bob's offer, I'll think carefully about it. Since the offer is still slightly in Bob's favor, I'll try to negotiate further. However, I'll accept this offer for now, as it's a relatively small difference and the game might go on for a long time.
