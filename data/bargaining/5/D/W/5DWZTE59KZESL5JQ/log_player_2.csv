Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This offer is fair considering the time pressure and inflation. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation hitting her harder, and is using increasingly urgent language. While her offer has improved, it's still not ideal.  By rejecting, I'm betting she'll get more anxious and offer a larger chunk in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient solution. Don't let inflation eat away at our potential gains any further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're now past the halfway point in the rounds.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of her money losing value faster, and my patience is wearing thin.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair and removes any sense of one person getting a better deal.
* **Strong Stance:** By proposing an even split, I'm signaling I'm unwilling to accept a deal heavily skewed in her favor. It might encourage her to be more reasonable in subsequent rounds if she rejects this."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm meeting you in the middle.  Accept this now, or the deal is off the table. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** Alice's tone has changed. She's no longer confident and is now making threats. This suggests she's very worried about the shrinking pot.
* **Acceptable Offer:** While not perfect, 450,000 is a reasonable sum, especially considering the inflation. Waiting longer could result in even worse offers or even reaching no deal at all. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. Accepting now secures a decent amount, even if it means conceding a bit more to Alice."
