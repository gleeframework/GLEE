"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 900,000 dollars for myself and give 100,000 dollars to Bob. I'm hoping this is a fair starting point and Bob will accept, as we have a lot of rounds to go through before the money diminishes significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm proposing a more even split this time, hoping to find common ground. After Bob's last offer, I think a 700,000 - 300,000 split is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the money is significantly less valuable due to inflation, it's still a decent sum for me.  It's also an even split, which feels more fair. We are running out of time, so accepting this offer is the most logical move."
