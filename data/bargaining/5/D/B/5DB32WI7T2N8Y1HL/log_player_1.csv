"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This way, I get a bigger share, but it's still a decent offer for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 4800. Bob's gain of 6000 is still the same in value. This is a good offer for me, considering the inflation. I'll accept.
