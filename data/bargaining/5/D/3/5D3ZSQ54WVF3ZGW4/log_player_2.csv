"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to share some.  Let's see how this goes.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite bold. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This considers the inflation affecting us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see you're playing hardball.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than 40%. Let's split it 55/45, considering the inflation that's hitting us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Here's why I decided to accept:

* **Inflation:** The longer this drags on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Alice. Her potential gains are shrinking faster.
* **Improving Offer:** Alice is moving in the right direction. While 55/45 isn't ideal, it's better than her initial offer and my previous offer was rejected.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more means risking an even worse deal in later rounds. Accepting now secures a reasonable sum."
