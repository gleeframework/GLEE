"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to ensure I get a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer a larger share, it's better to secure a gain now rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds.  This offer guarantees me some money, and I'm not sure how Bob's inflation will affect the next few rounds."
