"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI offered to take $55 and leave $45 for Bob, with a message suggesting this is a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I need a little more since you rejected my initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and proceed to the next round. The inflation might reduce the value, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, I'm adjusting my offer to take $52 and leave $48 for Bob. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money. Hopefully, Bob will find this proposal acceptable!"
