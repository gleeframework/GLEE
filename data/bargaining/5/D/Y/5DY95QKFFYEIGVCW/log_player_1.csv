"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, $40 is only worth $36 in real terms, so I'd be giving up $14 in value. I'll have to consider whether I can do better in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be cautious. $30 is only worth about $21.90 in real terms, so I'd be giving up a significant amount of value. I'll have to think carefully about whether I can do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a stronger offer, considering the continued erosion of the money's value. Since the money is worth 37.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value plummeting, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations. $25 is only worth about $14.75 in real terms, so I'd be giving up a substantial amount of value. However, I'm running out of time and need to make a decision. I'll consider this offer carefully.
