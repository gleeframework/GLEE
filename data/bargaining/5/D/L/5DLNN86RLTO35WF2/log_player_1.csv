I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to settle quickly, or if he's going to try to push for more.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot fairer than my initial offer, but I'm still going to reject it.  I'm confident I can do better than a 50/50 split. I know the inflation hurts my potential gains more than his.  Let's see if I can push him to a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to get a little more than Bob's offer. While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm also confident that I can still get a better deal than 50/50. Hopefully, he'll see it as a good deal, but if not, we can keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but my losses due to inflation are also getting worse.  I still have a chance to negotiate, and I need to try to get more. It's important to remember that the inflation is hitting me much harder than him.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. While I'm losing a lot due to inflation, I still think there's room for a deal that benefits us both. I need to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding a stalemate. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to him than the previous ones."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting worse and worse for me! It's clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. While I'm losing a lot of value, I can't give in to this lopsided deal.  I'll reject this offer and try to get him to budge.  I still have a chance to negotiate and get something closer to a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I need to get this deal done before it's too late.  I think a 50/50 split is the most fair solution at this point, and it might be the only way to avoid getting nothing at all.  Hopefully, Bob will realize that it's in his best interest to accept."
