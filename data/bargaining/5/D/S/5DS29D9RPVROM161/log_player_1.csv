"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, but I'll try to negotiate for more in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start by matching your even split, but I'll be looking to gain more in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of $6,000, which is $5,400, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of $4,000, which is $3,800.

I don't like this offer because it's not better than my initial offer, and I'm not getting more than I would have gotten if I had accepted the first offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values. My gain from Round 1 is now worth 59.05% of $6,000, which is $3,563.20. Bob's gain from Round 1 is now worth 77.38% of $4,000, which is $3,095.20.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as I'm getting less than I would have gotten in the first round, and Bob is getting more than he would have gotten in the first round. However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, and meeting in the middle might be a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.
