"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take most of the money but you get a small share to start.  We can work on a better split as we go.

# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is still heavily favoring Alice, especially with inflation working against me. I need to push for a more significant gain in the next round."
