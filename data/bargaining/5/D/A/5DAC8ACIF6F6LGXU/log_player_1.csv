"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a reasonable offer""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected a fair offer, now it's your turn to take a risk 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a risk and get a larger share of the money.

I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're taking a big risk, I'm not giving you 80% of the money""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob took a big risk and I rejected it, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter his previous proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted to take a risk, now it's your turn to take a small share""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split, which is a significant increase in my share. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to squeeze me dry, but I'm not going to let you get away with it 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me back, but I'm not going to let him get away with it either!

I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you're squeezing me, but I'm the one who's going to squeeze you out of a decent share""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer that's closer to the middle ground. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, we can both walk away with a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a more reasonable offer that should be acceptable to both of us."
