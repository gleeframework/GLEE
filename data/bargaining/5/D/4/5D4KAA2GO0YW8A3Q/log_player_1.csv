"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering to take $7,000 and leaving $3,000 for Bob. This way, we can both get a decent amount and have some room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a decent compromise, and I'll take $4,000."
