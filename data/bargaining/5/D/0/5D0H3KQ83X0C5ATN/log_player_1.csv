"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 400k, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that.  This is a more fair split, considering your 10% inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me $450,000, but it's worth 10% less than the $400,000 I proposed in Round 1, I'm actually getting less than I initially proposed. On the other hand, Bob is getting $550,000, which is worth 5% less than the $400,000 I initially offered him, but still more than he proposed in this round.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this offer yet. I'll reject it and make a new proposal in Round 3.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split, with me getting $540,000 and Bob getting $460,000."
