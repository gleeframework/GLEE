"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

After considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 30-70 split, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This split is more in line with the initial proposal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being reasonable, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise too. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

After considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 35-65 split, especially since the money is worth even less now due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. It's getting late in the game, and I think this is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, aiming for a 50-50 split. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think this is a reasonable ask."
