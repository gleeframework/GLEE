"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight advantage, but it's a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the 40 dollars I would gain is actually worth 95% of the original 50 dollars, which is $47.50.

I'm not sure if I want to give up 12.50 dollars, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose a slightly higher share for myself to account for the decreased value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still a fair offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of money! Since the money is worth 14.26% less than the original 50 dollars, the 35 dollars I would gain is actually worth $30.19.

I'm not thrilled about giving up $9.81, but I think it's a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept the offer.
