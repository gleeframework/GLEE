"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an 80/20 split, especially since the money is worth 10% less for Bob now. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being a bit stubborn.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less for Bob now. I'd like to propose another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
