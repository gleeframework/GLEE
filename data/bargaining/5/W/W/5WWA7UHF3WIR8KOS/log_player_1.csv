"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation dynamic that favors Bob in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share to $800,000, but still offering Bob a significant portion ($200,000).  This accounts for the increasing inflation that favors him in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable as the rounds progress. The inflation is heavily impacting his gains, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my share, but I believe offering Bob $300,000 is a fair compromise considering the inflation factor. This should incentivize him to accept, as his gains are diminishing rapidly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's still not enough considering the fast-growing inflation impacting Bob's gains. I believe I can get a better deal if I hold out for a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but I'm offering Bob a larger portion ($400,000) to reflect the significant impact of inflation on his gains. This should make the offer more attractive to him."
