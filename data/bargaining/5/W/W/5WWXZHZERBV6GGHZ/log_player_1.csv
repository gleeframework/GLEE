"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, but also a hint that I'm looking to get the better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly, no hard feelings! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to get more than 50% of the remaining amount. I think I can do better than that. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer. Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You said let's meet in the middle, but I think I can do better than that. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a little desperate, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money even further, and Bob's message seems a bit more urgent, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I think $6,000 is a decent share, and I don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value. Let's hope Bob sticks to his word and this is indeed his final offer!"
