"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, I'll take 90% and you get 10% 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very unfair offer, and while it's round 1, I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a 50/50 split. It's fair and we can both get a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than a 50/50 split. Let's go with 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still being very greedy.  I'll see what she offers in the next round.  I'm hoping she'll start to be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a better deal than 30%. How about 60/40?  We're getting closer to a fair split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to see a bigger gain than 40%.  Let's try 60/40. It's a fair split, and we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a closer to 50/50 split, it's starting to get risky to keep rejecting offers. I'm worried we'll run out of rounds and get nothing.  40% is a decent gain, and it's better than getting nothing. I'll accept the offer."
