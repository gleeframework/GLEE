"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I think this is a good starting point.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to give you a decent portion, but I'm not starting with a 4:1 split. Let's aim for something closer to even. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $4000 is worth 20% less than in the first round, so it's actually $3200 in terms of the initial $10,000. And Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 10% less than in the first round, so it's actually $5400.

Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too low for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share.""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}"
