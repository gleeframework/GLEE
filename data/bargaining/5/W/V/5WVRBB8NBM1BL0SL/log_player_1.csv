"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic negotiation scenario. I am offering Bob a small portion (10%) of the money, hoping to get a quick acceptance and secure the majority of the prize.  The risk is that Bob might reject the offer, and in the next round, I'll need to offer him more to compensate for the inflation penalty he'll face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** If I reject this offer, the next round will see my potential gains further reduced by 20%, making it even harder to get a good deal. 
* **Bob's Position:**  Bob has demonstrated he's willing to be aggressive. If I reject this offer, he'll likely offer me even less in the next round.
* **Relative Value:** Even with the 20% inflation penalty, $300,000 is still a significant sum.  It's a risk worth taking to avoid further potential losses."
