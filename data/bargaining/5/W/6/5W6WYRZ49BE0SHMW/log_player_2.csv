Alice's offer:

It's much too early in the game to accept such a small share.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```

Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation will favor Alice later on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a very uneven split, even with the inflation impacting her gain more than mine. I'll keep rejecting until she offers something closer to a fair division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a reasonable share for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still quite unfair, even with the inflation hitting her harder. I'll keep rejecting until she offers something closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
```

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm determined to get a fair deal. I'm now offering a 50/50 split, which should be the most reasonable outcome considering the inflation."
