Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nInteresting move by Bob! He's trying to appeal to my sense of fairness.\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, Bob's offer of 50$ is actually worth less to him than it would have been in the first round (50 * 0.95 = 47.5). Meanwhile, the value remains the same for me.\n\n###\n\nI think I can do better than that.\n\n###\n\nMy response is:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new offer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet me know when you're ready to proceed.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is still worth 0% less for me, but 10% less for Bob compared to the initial round.)\n\n###\n\nHere's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\nHave fun playing the game!"

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it closer to 50/50, but I need to account for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 53 
# Bob gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! He's trying to compromise and account for the inflation.\n\n###\n\nLet's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 14.26% less for Bob compared to the initial round, his gain of 47$ is actually worth around 40.26$ (47 * 0.8574).\n\n###\n\nMeanwhile, I'd be getting 53$, which is still worth the same as in the initial round.\n\n###\n\nI think I can still do better than that, but I need to be careful not to push Bob too far.\n\n###\n\nMy response is:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again!

He's feeling the pinch of inflation and is willing to compromise.\n\n###\n\nLet's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation.
