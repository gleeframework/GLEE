"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. This way, we both get a decent share and can start negotiating from a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective values are:

My gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500
Bob's gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a better deal than the first one. I'll accept it for now.
