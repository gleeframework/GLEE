"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's a fair starting point, and we can adjust from there. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's proposed split isn't quite fair from my perspective, especially considering the different inflation rates affecting our shares. I believe we can find a more equitable division. Let's proceed to the next round where I can make my proposal."
