"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9000, leaving $1000 for Bob.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as it's a 90/10 split in my favor.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk him rejecting my next offer and ending up with nothing."
