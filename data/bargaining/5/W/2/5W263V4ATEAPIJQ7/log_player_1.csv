"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but still leaving Bob with something.  Since the money will be worth less in the next round, it's in my best interest to close the deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a big improvement over my initial offer, but I'm still losing a lot of money.  I'm willing to take a smaller cut of the money in round 3, hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but I'm still taking the majority of the money. It's a risk, but I hope he accepts it.  With each round, the value of the money decreases, and I don't want to miss out on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer this round.  The money I'm getting is worth less than it was in the beginning, but the value is still dropping each round.  I'm risking losing even more if I keep rejecting offers.  It's a fair split considering the circumstances."
