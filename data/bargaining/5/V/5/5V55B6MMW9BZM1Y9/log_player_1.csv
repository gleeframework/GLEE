"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. 

This is a good starting point, as it gives me a large portion of the money while still offering Bob a significant share.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to make a counter-offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a significant drop from my initial offer.  While I'm not happy with the reduction in my share, I'm willing to hold out for a better deal.  I'll see what Bob's next offer is, and hopefully, we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to increase my share a bit from the last round, but still offer Bob a fair portion.  We're both losing value with each round, so hopefully, we can reach an agreement before too long."
