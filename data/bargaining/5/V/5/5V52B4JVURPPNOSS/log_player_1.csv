"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share. Let's split it 60-40.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the initial $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be more fair. You should get more in this round, but let's see if we can reach a more balanced split later. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less in this round, I'll actually be getting $380,000 ($400,000 x 0.95). Bob is proposing a 60-40 split, which is not very different from my initial offer.

However, I'm willing to compromise and see if we can reach a more balanced split later. I'll accept this offer for now.
