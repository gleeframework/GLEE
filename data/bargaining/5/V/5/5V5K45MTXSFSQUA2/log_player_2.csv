"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split is a decent starting point, I'd prefer to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""I think a 65/35 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but 55/45 is a fair middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger slice, it's likely that the next round's inflation will further decrease the value of my potential gains. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and it seems like Alice is willing to compromise."
