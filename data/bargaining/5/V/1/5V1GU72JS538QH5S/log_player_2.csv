"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous this time, but I'm sure you'll be more reasonable in the future.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try 60/40, but I'm sticking to my 60% cut. The clock is ticking, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While not ideal, accepting a 40/60 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and Alice seems firm on her 60% cut."
