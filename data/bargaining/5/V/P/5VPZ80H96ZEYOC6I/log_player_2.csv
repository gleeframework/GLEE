"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm going for a fair but slightly advantageous deal. Let's work together to reach a good outcome. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's message suggests a fair deal, the actual proposal is heavily skewed in her favor. I'll reject and see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm starting with a more balanced proposal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us, considering the inflation effects.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's try to reach a solution that's fair to both of us in light of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best move considering the inflation. I gain 4000, and while it's worth less than the initial 1000,  the inflation is substantial, and I risk losing even more if I keep rejecting. It's time to secure some gains."
