# Alice gain: 56

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that the value is decreasing, she's losing it at a much faster rate than I am.  I need to remain firm and hope she gets desperate enough to accept a more even split.  We're getting close to the halfway point, so the pressure is mounting for both of us."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous. We're approaching the halfway point, and the value is plummeting.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.""}
