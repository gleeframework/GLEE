Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the value of her potential winnings diminishes rapidly.  While her offer isn't terrible, we can likely squeeze out a better deal in the next couple of rounds. Bob is not affected by inflation, so time is on his side."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's end this and split it evenly. It's my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, Alice is feeling the pressure.  Her offers are getting more reasonable, but there's still a chance to secure a slightly better deal.
* **Firmness:**  Offering a 50/50 split is fair, especially given the inflation working against Alice. By stating it's the final offer, we signal firmness and increase the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Waiting longer for a slightly larger share carries the risk of Alice becoming resigned to losing everything. A 50/50 split guarantees a substantial gain for Bob."
