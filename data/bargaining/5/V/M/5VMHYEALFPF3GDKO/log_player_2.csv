Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more money we both lose. It's time to push for a more serious offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is ridiculous.  An even split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to accept anything less than a 50/50 split at this point.  We're running out of time and further negotiation risks losing everything to inflation. A firm stance is necessary."
