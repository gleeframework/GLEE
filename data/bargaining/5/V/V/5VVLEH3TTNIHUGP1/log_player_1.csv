  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of 400k, I'm getting a smaller share due to the inflation, but I still need to think strategically.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original $1,000,000, I need to be careful.

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money, and I'm getting desperate. With the money being worth 40.95% less than the original, I'm running out of time and options.

However, I'm not ready to give in yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate one last time.
