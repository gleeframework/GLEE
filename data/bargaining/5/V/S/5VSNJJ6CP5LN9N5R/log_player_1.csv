"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob. This is a generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we don't know what will happen in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not going for 60-40! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my share of $250,000 is now worth only 95% of its original value, which is $237,500.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only 25% of the remaining amount, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds either. I'll have to decide whether the potential benefits of future rounds are worth the risk of further inflation.

For now, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation has already taken a 5% bite out of my potential earnings, I'll aim to increase my share this round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving 45% for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting any younger, but I'm not getting any poorer either! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting now! My share of $200,000 is worth only 85.74% of its original value, which is $171,500.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only 20% of the remaining amount, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds either. The game is getting intense!

For now, I'll...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation has taken a significant bite out of my potential earnings, I'll aim to increase my share this round. However, I'll have to be careful not to overplay my hand. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal, Bob! Don't let it slip away!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving 55% for Bob. This is a relatively balanced offer, considering the inflation and the previous rounds. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
