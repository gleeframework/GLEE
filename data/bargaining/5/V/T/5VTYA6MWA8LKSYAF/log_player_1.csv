"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for my cleverness! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting! Okay, let's think this through...

I'm not sure I want to give Bob an 80-20 split, but I'm not sure I can do better. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. I'll aim for a higher share, but not too high to leave Bob with nothing.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 80% of the pie, Bob! I'm willing to give you 40%, but that's as high as I'll go!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 60-40 split. I'll have to think carefully...

However, I'm not sure I can do better, and this offer is still better than the previous ones. I'll take it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
