"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can work together!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said we can work together, but your first offer was a 60/40 split. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 58-42 split. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% toll on my gains, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial 60/40 split I proposed. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You want to meet in the middle? I'm willing to do that, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of rejecting your initial offer. This is my revised compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to adjust for the inflation and the risk he took by rejecting my initial offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I should give up more than 52% of the total. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, my gains are worth significantly less now. Here's my next proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day.""
}
