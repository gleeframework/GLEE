"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40-60, I'll try to offer a slight improvement in my favor. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting! My offer from round 2 was worth 42, but now it's worth 19% less, which is around 34. That's a decent increase from 30 (40-10% for inflation in round 1). However, Alice's offer is now 45 and 55, which is a good deal considering the inflation.

I'll think for a moment... Ah, I'll take it!
