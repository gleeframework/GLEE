Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. I'm proposing a 70/30 split.  This reflects the risk for both of us as we move forward.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible. I understand the risks, but I think a 60/40 split is more fair and still allows for a reasonable return for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time is working against me much faster than her.  Another rejection puts the ball back in my court to propose a more advantageous deal before inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."
