"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 3:1 in favor of Alice. This seems fair given the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 2500 is something, it's a very small portion of the total. It's worth risking a round to see if Alice will offer more, especially with inflation looming."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair. It acknowledges your prior proposal, but also accounts for the inflation risk we both face.""}
