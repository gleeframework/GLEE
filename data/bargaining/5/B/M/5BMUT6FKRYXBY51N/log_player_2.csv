"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30 in your favor. It's a fair deal considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is tempting, it's wise to consider the potential for inflation.  By rejecting, I can potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
