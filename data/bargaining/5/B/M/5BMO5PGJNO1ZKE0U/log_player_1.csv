"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the money, which seems like a generous starting point, and leaves 30% for Bob. The message is a friendly one, to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. Bob's offer is a 10% increase in my share, which is a decent improvement.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
