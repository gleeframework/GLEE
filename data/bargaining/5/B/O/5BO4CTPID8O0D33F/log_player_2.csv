"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the larger share, but you still get a decent amount. Accept this, and we can both walk away with some money.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""That's a bit greedy Alice! How about a more even split?  This offer ensures we both benefit significantly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see you're serious about getting a larger share.  This is my final offer before the inflation really starts to hurt.  Let's split the difference, and we'll both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is a factor, but not dire enough yet to warrant accepting a poor deal. I'm betting Alice will feel the pressure soon and offer a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,

""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. The longer this goes on, the less we both get.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a substantial sum.""}"
