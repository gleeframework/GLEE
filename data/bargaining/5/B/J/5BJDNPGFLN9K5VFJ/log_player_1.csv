Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000.  This seems fair, as I am the one taking the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
