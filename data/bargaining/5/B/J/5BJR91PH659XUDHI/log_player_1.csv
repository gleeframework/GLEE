"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering to give Bob 50% of the money, which is a fair and equal split. This way, we can both get a decent amount and avoid the risk of going to the next round with a significant reduction in value due to inflation."
