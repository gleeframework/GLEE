**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting closer to a more even split, but time is on my side.  With each round, the value of the money decreases for her, making her more likely to accept a deal favoring me as we approach the final rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real. I'm offering a completely even split.  Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering an even split now might seem like a compromise, but it plays to my advantage in the long run:

* **Psychological Pressure:**  Alice has consistently rejected offers favoring me, even as inflation diminishes her potential gains.  An even split might be enough to make her reconsider her stubbornness, especially as the deadline approaches.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Holding out for a heavily skewed offer in later rounds is risky.  Alice might get desperate and accept a less favorable deal, leaving me with nothing. 
* **Fairness Factor:** While I'm not overly concerned with being ""fair,"" proposing an even split makes me seem more reasonable. This could make Alice more receptive to accepting and avoids any potential accusations of greed that could backfire in the later rounds."
