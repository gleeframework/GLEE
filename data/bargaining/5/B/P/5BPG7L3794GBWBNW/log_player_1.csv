"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the actual amounts I would receive are:

* 40% of $100 = $40
* 60% of $100 = $60

I'll accept this offer. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
