"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  My last offer was more than generous.  This is a compromise, but time is working against us both. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's clear she feels the pressure of the inflation working against her more than it is against me. Holding out for a better offer is still the right move."

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a quarter of a million dollars! Don't be greedy, let's end this now before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the heat of the inflation, but her offer is still unacceptable. She's trying to frame me as greedy, but I'm simply aiming for a fair division.  The longer she waits, the worse it gets for her, so I'll continue to hold firm."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical.  I'm adjusting my offer to be even more reasonable. It's a win-win if we agree now.  Time is running out!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm slightly lowering my ask to show flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This might make Alice more receptive.
* **Emphasize Urgency:**  Continue to highlight the time pressure, especially on Alice who is feeling the inflation pinch.
* **Positive Framing:**  Present the offer as a win-win, encouraging Alice to see the mutual benefit of a quick agreement."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. You're getting over a third of the money for doing nothing.  Take it or leave it.  We're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is now within a range where accepting is strategically sound. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the halfway point, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure.  If I reject this, there's a real risk she'll dig in, and the offers could get worse, not better, for me.
* **Declining Value for Alice:**  The longer this goes on, the less attractive her share becomes due to inflation.  This gives me a small advantage, but that advantage diminishes each round we continue.
* **Reasonable Return:** 350,000 is a significant sum, even if it's less than I believe I could have secured with more time. It's better to take a solid offer now than risk ending up with nothing if negotiations completely break down."
