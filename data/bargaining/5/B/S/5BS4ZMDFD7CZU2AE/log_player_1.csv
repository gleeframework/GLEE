"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, let's start with 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly, no need to negotiate too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take $5,000 and Bob will take $5,000. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going into more rounds with the decreasing value of money."
