Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the inflation, but 52/48 is still a bit too skewed for my liking. How about we meet in the middle at 53/47? It's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the changing value while still being fair to both of us.

# Bob gain: 53
