"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob thinks a 60-40 split is more fair now?

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, as I think I can do better than a 40% gain. The inflation is already affecting the money, and I'd like to get a better deal before accepting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair split, considering the reduced value of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split, with me getting $540,000 and Bob getting $460,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's get closer to a 55/45 split. This reflects the changing value of the money and is a fairer distribution. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer from Bob. A 55-45 split is getting closer to what I want, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, as I think I can still do better. The money is worth significantly less now, and I'd like to try to get a better deal before accepting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less now, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need to prioritize my own gain. This is my final compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 49-51 split, with me getting $490,000 and Bob getting $510,000."
