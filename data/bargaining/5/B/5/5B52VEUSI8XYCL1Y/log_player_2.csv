Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair split, considering the reduced value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Alice is still proposing a larger share for herself, and while I'm aware of the inflation, I want to see if I can negotiate a better split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need to prioritize my own gain. This is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 510000 
# Alice gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  Even though the inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, I'm happy to get a slightly larger share than Alice.  It's important to remember that we only have a limited number of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
