"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and take the rest. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm giving you a decent share to make the game interesting. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it down the middle.  I'm confident we can reach a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, the offer from Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still not a good deal for me. I'd rather negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not willing to split it down the middle, as it doesn't take into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3, taking into account the reduced values due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $550,000 and leave you with $450,000. This way, I'm getting a slightly better deal, but it's still a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more, but still leaving you with a significant share. What do you think, Bob?"
