"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

 I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for the lion's share of the money. I'll see if Bob is willing to accept this upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and it's better than getting nothing in the end. I'll accept."
