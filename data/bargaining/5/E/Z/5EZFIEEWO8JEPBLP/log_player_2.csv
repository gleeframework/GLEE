Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hits me harder. I'm taking a slight hit from my last offer, but this ensures we both benefit before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
