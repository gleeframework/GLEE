Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm taking a risk here, Alice, and offering a very small amount to Bob. This is to see how he reacts and gauge his risk tolerance.  I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round, as he doesn't know about the inflation yet.  But if he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is clearly taking advantage of the inflation! I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this round. It's fair, and I believe Bob might be more inclined to accept it.  He likely knows the inflation is hitting him harder than me, and this deal is better for him than the previous round."
