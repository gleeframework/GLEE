"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the inflation penalty!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more skewed towards him, but I'll consider it.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the 60$. It's better than risking losing more in the next round due to inflation!"
