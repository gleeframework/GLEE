"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take 10, I'll take 90.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90:10 split, giving Bob a relatively small amount to start with, while I take the majority. The message is a friendly introduction to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 45 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 55 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if 45 is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise at 60/40. Don't wait too long, the value of our money is dropping!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable."
