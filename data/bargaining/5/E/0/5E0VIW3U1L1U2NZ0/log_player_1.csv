"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the one who makes the next offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I already have 5000$, I now have 5000 + 4000 = 9000$.

I don't think I should accept this offer because I'm giving up 1000$ (5000 - 4000) and Bob is gaining 6000, which is 20% more than he would have gained in the first round. This doesn't seem like a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, and I have 9000$, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping that Bob will accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 5000 each is a fair split, considering the inflation has taken a toll on my gains 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I already have 9000$, I now have 9000 + 5000 = 14000$.

However, I'm not sure if Bob's gains are worth the same as in the first round. He's saying his gain is 5000, but due to inflation, his gain is actually worth 48.8% less than in the first round. So, his gain is actually worth 51.2% of what it would have been in the first round.

Considering this, I think I'm getting a slightly better deal than Bob. I'll accept his offer.
