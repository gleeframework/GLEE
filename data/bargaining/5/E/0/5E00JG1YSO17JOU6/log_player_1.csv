"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share this round, but I think this is a more reasonable split considering the initial offer was 75/25 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
