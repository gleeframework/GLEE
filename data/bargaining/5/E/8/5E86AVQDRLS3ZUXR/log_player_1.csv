"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally""}\n\nI'm offering $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Since the value of money decreases with each round, I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable division early on to minimize losses due to inflation. By giving Bob a slightly smaller share, I'm acknowledging his lower rate of inflation while still advocating for a larger portion due to my higher rate of loss. This initial offer sets the stage for negotiations, aiming to find a balance between our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a more advantageous split.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because accepting $40, which is worth 20% less than in the first round, would significantly undervalue my share. Considering the impact of inflation, Bob's offer of $60 for himself and $40 for me is not equitable. Given that I'm losing value at a higher rate, I need to negotiate a better split to compensate for the loss over the rounds. Rejecting this offer allows me to propose a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a more balanced division that considers the differing inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, with a message emphasizing the need to find a middle ground that accounts for the inflation rates affecting both of us. Given that I'm losing value at a 20% rate and Bob at a 5% rate, my aim is to negotiate a split that is slightly more favorable to me to offset the higher rate of loss, while still being reasonable and potentially acceptable to Bob. By slightly reducing my initial offer, I'm showing willingness to compromise and hoping to conclude the negotiation before further value is lost."
