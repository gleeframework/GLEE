I'm going for a very slightly unfair split in my favor. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount right away, or if he's hoping for a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even with the 5% inflation.  I'm going to reject this and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the first round, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before the inflation hits him too hard."
