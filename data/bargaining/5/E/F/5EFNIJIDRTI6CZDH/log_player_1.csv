"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I think I can do better. I'm proposing we split it evenly. Let's avoid any further losses due to inflation and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the inflation. I'm proposing a compromise: $55 for me and $45 for you.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on inflation, but we're both losing value with each round. Let's split the money evenly and move on. It's the most sensible option for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 
 
Even though it's not the best deal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking further losses due to inflation. Bob is unlikely to offer anything better and the longer we wait, the less favorable the outcome will be for me."
