"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to adjust my strategy. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer because I want to try to get more money. I think I can do better than 10% of the remaining amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, my offer would be worth much less than I initially thought. Considering Bob's offer, I think I should accept it since it's a relatively better deal than what I would get after the next round's inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
