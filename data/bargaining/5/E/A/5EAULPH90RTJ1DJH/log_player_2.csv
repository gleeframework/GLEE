"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's as low as I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better than Alice's first offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation factor is starting to hurt, but holding out for a better deal is still the best option. Alice knows the clock is ticking for me, so she might be trying to push her luck."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against me. I'm offering you 480,000 which is a very fair deal. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  It's round 4, and the inflation is eating into my potential gains.  I need to start pushing for a more favorable split.
* **Strong stance:**  The ""take it or leave it"" message conveys urgency and firmness, hoping Alice will realize accepting a decent offer now is better than risking getting a worse deal later. 
* **Appearing reasonable:**  While the 52-48 split favors me, it's not drastically different from Alice's previous offer. This could make her more likely to accept, seeing it as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed taking its toll on your share, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway... of my previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's also acknowledging the impact of inflation.  However, ""halfway"" from her previous offer is still not a good deal.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate I might seem, but accepting a bad deal now will hurt more in the long run. I need to show I'm willing to risk it all to get a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a near even split at 51-49.  Accept this, and we both walk away with something substantial. Don't let greed make us both losers.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is becoming critical.  It's time to make a strong, final push for a favorable outcome.
* **Near Even Split:** Offering a 51-49 split is designed to be tempting to Alice. It's a minimal gain for me, portraying it as a fair and reasonable compromise.
* **Appeal to Logic and Fear:** The message emphasizes the very real possibility of both players losing everything if this continues.  It aims to make Alice reconsider her tough stance and opt for a sure win."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob. I'll give you a tiny bit more, but don't expect me to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It pains me to do this, but Alice is right - I'm getting desperate. The inflation is killing me, and this offer is barely above her previous one. If I reject it, there's a very real chance she'll offer even less next round, and the value of the money will continue to plummet. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but getting something is better than nothing at this point."
