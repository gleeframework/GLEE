900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%.  Let's see if we can find a better solution in future rounds.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was quite cheeky!  Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider that with inflation, waiting any longer will only hurt us both.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I appreciate your proposal, Bob, but I still think 60/40 is too much in your favor.  Let's compromise at 55/45. We're both losing value with each round, so let's try to find a solution that benefits us both.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, I understand you're aiming for a larger share, but 55/45 is still not fair to me. I'm proposing 52/48 â€“ a slight shift towards a more equitable split. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation.",Bob,4,
