"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth $180,000, and Bob's gain of $800,000 is now worth $640,000. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is getting a larger share of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but still trying to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll. With the new values, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $219,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is now worth $364,800. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as Bob is still getting a larger share of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50/50 split, trying to find a compromise that might be more acceptable to Bob."
