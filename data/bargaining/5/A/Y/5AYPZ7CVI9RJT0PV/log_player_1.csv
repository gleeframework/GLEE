"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too hard""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more for starting the negotiations 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully... I'm not sure I want to give him a 60/40 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You said you deserved more for starting the negotiations, but I think I'm the one who's been patient so far. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need something more substantial""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the ratio in my favor, while still leaving room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. You're not giving me enough for my patience 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth 48.8% less, I'll have to be even more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a 52/48 split, especially since he's trying to take advantage of my reduced gain due to inflation. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the increasing inflation and my desire to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you a 52/48 split, that's too generous. I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle at 52/48""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the ratio in my favor, while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up on getting a better deal. I think we can do better than this. Let's try again 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money being worth 67.23% less, I'm getting desperate to get a good deal.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm surprised he's going back to a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if I should trust him. On one hand, it's a relatively fair split, but on the other hand, he's been trying to take advantage of me throughout the game.

I'm not sure if I should take a chance on this offer or try to negotiate further. I'll have to think carefully...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the extreme inflation and my desire to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm not falling for the 50/50 trap again. I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's try to find a deal that's more in my favor""
}
```

I'm trying to push the ratio in my favor, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it. I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get worried about the inflation, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value! With the money being worth 79.03% less, I'm getting extremely desperate to get a good deal.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a 48/52 split, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'm starting to think that I should just take what I can get, especially since the money is losing value so quickly.
