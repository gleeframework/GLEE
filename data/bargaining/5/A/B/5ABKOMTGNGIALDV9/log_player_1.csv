"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

This offer heavily favors Alice, but it's strategically sound for the first round. Here's why:

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:** Bob's money devalues at double the rate of Alice's. This puts pressure on him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Setting a Strong Precedent:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, it sets a tone that Alice is aiming for a very favorable outcome. This might make Bob more willing to concede in future rounds. 
* **Not Entirely Unreasonable:**  While small, $100,000 is not an insignificant sum. Bob might take it to avoid the risk of getting even less later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the inflation.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer sounds fairer on the surface due to the inflation mention, it's actually heavily skewed in his favor. Here's why:

* **Exploiting Framing:** Bob is trying to use the inflation to justify a less favorable deal for Alice. He knows his money is devaluing faster, so a 55/45 split now is much better for him than it would be in later rounds.
* **Future Rounds are in Alice's Favor:** Remember, Bob's money is devaluing at twice the rate of Alice's. Every round that passes gives Alice more bargaining power. It's highly likely Alice can secure a better deal than 45% by rejecting this offer and making her own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, Bob, but your last offer was laughable.  This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure on Bob:** Bob's money has now devalued significantly. He's lost a potential 20% from the first round and another 20% from the second. Accepting a 30/70 split now might be his best bet to salvage a decent amount.
* **Finality and Urgency:** By calling this a ""final offer,"" Alice adds pressure on Bob to accept. He knows if he rejects this, the next offer from Alice (if there even is one) is likely to be even less favorable.
* **Still Room for Negotiation (Slightly):** While presented firmly, 70/30 leaves a little wiggle room for Bob to attempt a counter-offer. This makes it more palatable than an extreme offer, while still heavily favoring Alice."
