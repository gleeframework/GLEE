"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is seemingly fair at first glance, I'm going to reject it.  I'm aware of the inflation rate, and even though I'm losing 5% each round, I believe I can get a better deal for myself.  Let's see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. I think this is a fair solution considering the inflation rate, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all.""}
