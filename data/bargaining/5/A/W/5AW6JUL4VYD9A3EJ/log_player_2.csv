"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This is a good deal for both of us to end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This offer is fair, given the current value of the money.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is already costing us both. Let's be practical -  I'm taking a smaller cut than my last offer to get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a better deal than what I offered and the potential further decrease in value makes this a good choice."
