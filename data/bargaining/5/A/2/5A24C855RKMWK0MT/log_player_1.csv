"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, taking 90% of the money.  I'm assuming Bob doesn't know about the inflation factor yet, so I'm trying to grab as much as possible before it kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is significantly better for him than my initial offer, I'm still better off accepting it.  I'm losing 20% of the value with each round, and the value of my share would be further reduced in the next round if I reject this offer. It's better to take the smaller share now than risk getting nothing later."
