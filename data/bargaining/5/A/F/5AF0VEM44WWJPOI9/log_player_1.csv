"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and equal division of the $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is becoming less valuable, so I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject this offer because I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially with the money losing value due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a small consolation 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money worth 27.1% less than the original, I'm getting increasingly concerned about getting a good deal.

However, considering the previous offers and the current state of the economy, I'm not thrilled about this 70/30 split. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject this offer and would like to continue negotiating. I'm hoping to get a better split, but I'm not sure if I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'd like to make a new offer that takes into account the current economic conditions. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a better deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35/65 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm hoping that he'll be willing to meet me in the middle. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a significant majority, but I'm not being unfair 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money worth 40.95% less than the original, I'm getting increasingly desperate to get a good deal.

However, I'm not thrilled about this 80/20 split, especially considering the significant difference in value between the two offers. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, but I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject this offer and would like to continue negotiating. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me at a more reasonable split, but I'm not optimistic at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'm getting close to desperation. I'd like to make a new offer that takes into account the current economic conditions. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting close to accepting, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25/75 split, which is a significant concession on my part, but I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me at this point. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, and I'm starting to worry that I'll be left with very little value if I don't accept something soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a large majority, it's my last offer 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really ravaging the value of the money! With the money worth 52.17% less than the original, I'm getting extremely concerned about getting a good deal.

However, I'm not sure if I have any other options left. I'm not thrilled about this 90/10 split, but I'm starting to think that it might be the best I can get at this point.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept this offer, unfortunately. I'm not happy about it, but I don't see any other way to get a better deal. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to stick to this agreement."
