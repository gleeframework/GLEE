"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure most of the money in the first round. Since the money is worth less with each round, I want to maximize my gains as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation means my share of the money is shrinking rapidly. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least 30%, which is better than the risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
