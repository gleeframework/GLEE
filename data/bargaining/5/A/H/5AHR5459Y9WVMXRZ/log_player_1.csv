"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200
