"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach this time, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my potential gain is now worth less, so I need to be more careful. Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive this time, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to myself. Considering the 20% inflation, I'll aim for a higher gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit too aggressive, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to find a compromise, but I'm not giving up too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, my potential gain is now worth significantly less. Bob's offer seems more balanced this time, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and take $5,000. It's not the best outcome for me, but I don't see a better opportunity to improve my share."
