"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  This gives you a good chunk to walk away with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point.  While 100,000 is not terrible, it's clear Alice is trying to take the lion's share.  By rejecting, Bob sets the stage for negotiation and potentially a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but the clock is ticking and this money is losing value for me! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  While she's using the inflation argument, it's still a significant imbalance. It's time to see if she'll come down further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than the last offer. This is a fair split considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Meet me in the middle or this deal is off! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still unfavorable, even considering inflation.  While she's putting pressure on with the ""meet in the middle"" statement, it's important to remember the inflation is hurting her more than it is hurting me.  I need to hold out for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $450,000. This is a fair split considering the inflation and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's end this now before we both lose more money.""}
