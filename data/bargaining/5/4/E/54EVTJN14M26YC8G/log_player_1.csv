"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain:

$300,000 * 0.95 (95% of the original value) = $285,000

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting less than I initially offered in the first round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less than the previous round). I'll take this into account when making my offer.

Since I rejected the previous offer and want to be more aggressive, I'll offer a slightly lower amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amount I'd gain, considering the 14.26% reduction in value compared to the first round:

$450,000 * 0.854 (1 - 0.1426) = $384,330

This is a slightly better deal than my previous offer, and I'm getting closer to my target. I'll accept this offer.
