Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a more even split. Let's see if Alice is willing to play fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting late in the game, and the inflation is hurting both of us. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money."
