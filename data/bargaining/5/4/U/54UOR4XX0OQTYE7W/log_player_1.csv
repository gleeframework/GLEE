"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's new offer, I'm considering the value of the money in the next round. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 500,000$. However, Bob's gain of 600,000$ is worth 5% less than my gain, so it's effectively 600,000 * 0.95 = 570,000$. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'm still getting the same amount as before, but Bob is getting more.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself this time.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money in this round.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 500,000$. However, Bob's gain of 520,000$ is worth 14.26% less than the 600,000$ he would have gotten in the first round, so it's effectively 520,000 * 0.8554 = 445,088$. This is actually less than my gain, which is a bit surprising!

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer.
