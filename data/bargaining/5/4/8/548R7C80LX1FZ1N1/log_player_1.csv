Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that benefits me more, but it's still a reasonable offer.  It leaves some money for Bob, and hopefully, he'll accept it.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and the inflation is a serious concern. I'd rather take the 70 now than risk getting nothing later."
