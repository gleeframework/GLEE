"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want something more balanced.  I'm willing to come down to 55/45, but I can't accept anything less than that considering the money keeps losing value for me with every round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
