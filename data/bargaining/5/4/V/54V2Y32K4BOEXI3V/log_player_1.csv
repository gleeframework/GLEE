Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. This is to see how Bob will react and to get a sense of his risk tolerance.  I believe that by offering a small amount to Bob in the early rounds, he might be more likely to accept a slightly better offer in the future, as he will be losing money with each passing round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Bob's offer is a much fairer split than my initial proposal. Even with the inflation factor, getting half of the money is a good outcome. It's risky to reject this and potentially face an even worse offer in the future."
