"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming to secure the deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a relatively even split. I hope this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with this split, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I believe that the decreasing value of money for Bob will make this offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is slightly better than the previous one, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to reject offers and negotiate. The inflation is hitting Bob harder than me, so I'm hoping that he'll be more willing to compromise in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm taking another step back in my offer, aiming to reach a compromise point. With the increasing inflation, Bob's share is shrinking rapidly, and I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is getting closer to my ideal split, I'm still hoping for a more even distribution. The inflation is working in my favor, and I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to reject offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm making a significant concession this round, but I still believe I can secure a better deal than Bob is offering. The inflation is hurting him far more than me, and I'm hoping he'll accept this offer before the value of his share drops even further."
