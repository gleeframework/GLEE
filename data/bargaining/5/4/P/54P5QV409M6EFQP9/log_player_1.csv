"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3 to start, and we can reassess in the next round""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 400000 / 0.8 = 500000
Bob's gain: 600000 / 0.95 = 631578.947 ( rounded to 631579)

I'll reject Bob's offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more now, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
