Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer gives you a significant share, and with inflation, the value will decrease for both of us. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Bob is right, inflation is eating away at the value, especially for me. A 20% decrease is significant.
* **Power Shift:**  However, Bob's offer, while seeming generous at first glance,  doesn't account for the rapidly shifting power dynamic.  With each round, my losses are greater than his. This gives me more leverage to negotiate in the next round.
* **Future Potential:** By rejecting, I force Bob to make a better offer in the next round. He's clearly eager to settle (hence his ""end this quickly"" comment).  I can likely secure a better deal by waiting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Your offer was tempting, but doesn't fully account for the rapid inflation. Let's meet closer to the middle.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Rejection:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure to settle quickly. My rejection gives me room to negotiate a larger share.
* **Inflation Awareness:** I'm acknowledging the inflation issue (which he pointed out), making it clear I'm not being unreasonable.
* **Shifting Towards Middle Ground:** While I could push for more, meeting closer to the middle ground makes it more likely Bob will accept and end the game. This secures a win for me before inflation further erodes the value."
