"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'll see how Bob responds."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. With inflation, $2500 is now worth $2250. It's a significant reduction, but I'm not sure if I want to accept a 3:7 split. I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
