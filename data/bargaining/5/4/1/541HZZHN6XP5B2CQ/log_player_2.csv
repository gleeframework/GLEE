Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a decent share, considering the time constraint and inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my situation. While the offer seems tempting as time runs out, accepting a deal where I get less than 50% when I'm the one being penalized by time is a bad outcome. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a larger share, even if it means risking getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share than my previous offer, but I won't go any lower. Time is running out for both of us.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying seriousness:**  By slightly reducing my demand, I'm showing Alice that I'm negotiating and willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate enough to accept a bad deal.
* **Shifting focus to her loss:**  By emphasizing that time is running out for both of us, I remind her that her stubbornness could cost her as well. 
* **Avoiding extreme demands:**  While I could aim higher, asking for significantly more than 5200 at this stage might be interpreted as unreasonable and make Alice less likely to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to look out for myself. This offer is a slight compromise, and I urge you to consider it carefully. We're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical.  While not ideal, Alice's offer is barely acceptable for the following reasons:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left and inflation severely cutting into my potential gains, the risk of getting nothing is very high if I reject this offer. 
* **Slight Improvement:** Alice has moved slightly in my favor from her previous offer. This suggests she might be feeling the pressure too and is unwilling to risk a stalemate.
* **Minimizing Losses:** Accepting this offer at least guarantees me some share of the money, even if it's far from the ideal outcome. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but at this point, accepting is the most rational choice to avoid a complete loss."
