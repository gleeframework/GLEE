"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more now to account for inflation risk, and we both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair in the current round, it's important to consider the future rounds. Rejecting the offer allows me to propose a deal in the next round that is more favorable to me, as Alice's money will be worth less due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 55/45, with me taking the larger share. This accounts for the inflation disadvantage you'll face in the next round. It's a good deal for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it wasn't quite fair considering the inflation.  I'm willing to take a smaller amount than my last offer, but I need a bit more to make it worth the risk. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is more favorable to me than the previous round, it still does not account for the full potential of future rounds. By rejecting this offer, I can make a counter-proposal that is more advantageous in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose a 60/40 split, which is a fair compromise given the inflation. Accept this and we can both walk away with a significant amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We need to settle this now. I'm taking another hit on my share, offering you 480,000.  Take it or leave it - this is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is tempting and represents a decent share for me, it's important to remember the impact of inflation.  Rejecting this offer gives me another chance to make a proposal in the next round, potentially securing a larger share as Alice's money continues to lose value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""alice_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we are both losing money with each passing round.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor, which takes into account the significant inflation you're facing.  This is a fair offer that will allow us to both walk away with a considerable sum.  Let's settle this before we both lose even more.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is ridiculous. I'm losing money with every round we play. I'm offering you 520,000 - take it or leave it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is still tempting, but the risk of further rounds is too high. My gains are not increasing, while her offer is getting lower with each round. The possibility of ending the game now and securing a decent share is more appealing than risking another round of potential losses for both of us."
