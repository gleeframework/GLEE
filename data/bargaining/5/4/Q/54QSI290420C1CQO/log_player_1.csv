"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving 100,000 to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even with inflation.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob.  This is a compromise, recognizing that Bob has leverage after rejecting my last proposal.  Hopefully this will lead to a deal before the inflation eats away at our gains further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with inflation, Bob's offer is now a 50/50 split, which is fair and likely the best I can get.  I'll accept to end the game."
