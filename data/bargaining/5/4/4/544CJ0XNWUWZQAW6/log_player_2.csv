I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Let's see if she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still hoping for a better deal.  Alice's offer is getting worse, but let's see if we can push her further."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm raising my offer to 80/20, hoping that Alice will see the value in taking what she can get before things get worse for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  Alice's offer is now a 50/50 split, and while I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal with the inflation hitting her gains so hard.  Let's take this and run!"
