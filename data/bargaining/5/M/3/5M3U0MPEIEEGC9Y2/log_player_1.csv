Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take on some inflation risk, but I think a 70:30 split is a more reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
