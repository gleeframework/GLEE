"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair and balanced split""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair and balanced split, considering we're starting with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking the majority of the money, but I suppose it's better than nothing. I'll accept the offer, but I'll make sure to keep in mind that Bob is trying to take advantage of me.
