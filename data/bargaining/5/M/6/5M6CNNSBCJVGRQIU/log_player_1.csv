"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 in my favor""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. My message to Bob is that I'm proposing a fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair deal for you 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the values are now:

Alice's gain: 300,000 (down from 600,000)
Bob's gain: 630,000 (down from 700,000)

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, as Bob is getting a significant amount more than me. My initial proposal was a 60-40 split, and now Bob is proposing a 70-30 split. I'm not sure if this is a ""fair deal"" as Bob claims.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 42-58 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a more moderate split than my initial 60-40 proposal, but still slightly biased in my favor. My message to Bob is that I'm meeting him in the middle, trying to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took more last round, I'll try to balance it out this time 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: 400,000 (down from 420,000)
Bob's gain: 439,200 (down from 580,000)

It seems like Bob is trying to balance it out, but the values are still close to the previous round. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, as it's still a 60-40 split in Bob's favor.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a slight increase in Bob's share, but still slightly biased in my favor. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I want a better deal 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: 350,000 (down from 450,000)
Bob's gain: 391,500 (down from 550,000)

It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns, but the values are still quite close to the previous round. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, as it's still a 65-35 split in Bob's favor.

I'll reject this offer for now.

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet at 50-50, no more games""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to meet him at a 50-50 split, and I'm tired of playing games."
