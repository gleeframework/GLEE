Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but letting the money devalue hurts you more than me.  I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 30%. How about a 60/40 split? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, the deal still heavily favors her.  It's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us. Accepting a 40% share now might seem okay, but it will be worth significantly less in a few more rounds. I need to push for a more equitable split while there's still a decent amount of money left to divide."
