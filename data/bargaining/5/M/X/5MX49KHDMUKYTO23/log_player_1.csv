I'm going to propose a split that gives me a large share, but still offers Bob something.  This is my opening move, and I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid risking getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer. It's not even close to what I was hoping for, and I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm lowering my demand slightly, but still aiming for a significant share. This time, I'm offering Bob a more balanced portion.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting, rather than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
