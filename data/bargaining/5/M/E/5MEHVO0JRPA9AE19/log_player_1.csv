I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will be happy to accept and we both get something.  I'll take a big chunk, but I'm still leaving him with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is not good for me.  Even though I'm losing 5% due to inflation, I can do better than that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar split to what I proposed in the first round, but increase my share slightly to account for the inflation. This should be a reasonable offer for Bob, and still gives me a decent amount considering the inflation."
