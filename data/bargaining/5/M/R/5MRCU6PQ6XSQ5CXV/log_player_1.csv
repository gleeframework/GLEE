Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer where I take $60 and Bob takes $40. I also included a message suggesting that this division is somewhat fair, but I'm taking a bit more. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This is better than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than you offered""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI made an offer where I take $58 and Bob takes $42. I also included a message suggesting that I've compromised by taking a bit less than my initial offer, but still more than Bob's previous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than you offered""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the best I can do. Let's settle it now before inflation eats our money away! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I will accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think it's wise to settle now rather than risking further devaluation. Bob's offer seems reasonable at this point.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game here!"
