# Alice gain: 900000

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than your last offer. This split recognizes your faster depreciation rate, while giving me a reasonable share. Let's end this quickly before the money is worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
