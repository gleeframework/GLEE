"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, reflecting the faster depreciation of the money for me. This allows us both to get a significant portion of the value, while accounting for our different risk tolerances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
