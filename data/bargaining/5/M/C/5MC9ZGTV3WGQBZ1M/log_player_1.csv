I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming to take the majority of the money in the first round.  This strategy aims to maximize my gains before the inflation kicks in.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more reasonable, but I still think I can do better. Since inflation is hitting me harder, I need to get a bigger slice of the pie to compensate.  I'll reject this and see if I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm increasing my proposed share slightly from the previous round, hoping to reach a compromise. I'm aware of the inflation, but I still want to secure a good chunk of the money before it decreases further.  Let's see if Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hitting me hard now, and Bob's offer is the most reasonable one yet. I'm not thrilled with losing so much, but it's better than continuing to fight and potentially losing even more in the next round.  I'll take the 60 dollars and call it a day."
