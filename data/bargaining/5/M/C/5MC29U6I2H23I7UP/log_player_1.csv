"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to be greedy and propose taking 90% of the money.  It's risky, but if Bob accepts, I win big. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy!  He's essentially offering me the same amount as my initial proposal, but I'm losing 20% of the value due to inflation.  I'll reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my demand slightly, but still aim for a significant portion of the money. Since I'm losing value due to inflation, I need to secure a good deal quickly.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to be even more flexible in the next round."
