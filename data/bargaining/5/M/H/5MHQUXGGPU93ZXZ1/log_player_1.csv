"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, this way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less now.

I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, as it would mean I'd be getting less than I did in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than last time.""
}
```

I'm trying to take a bit more than the even split that Bob proposed, but not too much, in case he accepts and we can end the game quickly."
