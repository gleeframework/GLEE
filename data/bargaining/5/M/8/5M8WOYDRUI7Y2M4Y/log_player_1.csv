"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $30 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $30 * 0.95 = $28.50. Bob's gain of $70 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $70 * 0.8 = $56.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I should be more aggressive in my negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Since the money is worth 5% less than the previous round, I'll aim to increase my share accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 55%. My message is a conciliatory one, inviting Bob to find a compromise and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not giving up 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $20 is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is $20 * 0.8574 = $17.15. Bob's gain of $80 is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, which is $80 * 0.512 = $40.96.

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money, I think I should be more cautious and try to negotiate further. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting worried, let's make a deal before it's too late""
