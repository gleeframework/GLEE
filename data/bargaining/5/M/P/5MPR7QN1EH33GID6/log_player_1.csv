"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. This seems like a reasonable starting point, as I'm giving Bob a significant amount while also keeping a larger share for myself. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly, before the money loses value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split things a bit more evenly. This accounts for the time-value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is losing value due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer gives me $4500, but I initially offered him $4000, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Plus, the money is losing value faster for Bob, so I have a bit of leverage there. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4750 and keep $5250 for myself. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair middle ground. The message ""Meet in the middle"" conveys my intention to find a mutually acceptable solution. Since the money is losing value due to inflation, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and ending the game quickly."
