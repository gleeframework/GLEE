"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! 90% for me, 10% for you.""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will want to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I would have gotten in the first round. However, splitting it evenly is a good compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
