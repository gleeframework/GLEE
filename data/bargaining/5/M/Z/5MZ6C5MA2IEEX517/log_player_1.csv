"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the inflation effect, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect and the fact that Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is increasing! With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 14.26% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering the decreasing value of the money Bob gains, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
