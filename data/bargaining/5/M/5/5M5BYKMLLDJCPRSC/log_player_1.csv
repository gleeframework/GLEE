"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining rounds fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can divide the remaining rounds fairly, with each of us proposing a division in each subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I want a bigger piece too! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a fair offer, especially considering the inflation rate. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm still hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give up yet! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is still trying to negotiate, but his offer isn't getting any more favorable.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as it's still not a good split, especially considering the inflation rate. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to get a decent amount. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is finally willing to meet me in the middle!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to accept it. Let's split the money 50/50 and end the game!"
