Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

I'm offering to give Bob $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I already offered $6,000 in the first round, I can do better than $4,000 in this round.

I reject Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 6000 for him and 4000 for me, and due to inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, I'll aim to get a bit more than what I offered in the first round.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I already offered $6,500 in the third round, I can do better than $5,000 in this round.

I reject Bob's offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 5000 for him and 5000 for me, and due to inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, I'll aim to get a bit more than what I offered in the first round.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... I made a mistake in my previous response. I said the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but that's not true. With 5 rounds of inflation, the money I gain is worth 0.8^5 = 0.32768 of what it was in the first round. So, my gain of $6,500 in the third round is actually worth $2,124.80 in this round.

Considering this, Bob's offer of $6,000 for me is actually worth $3,888.96, which is more than what I can get if I accept this offer.

I reject Bob's offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 6000 for him and 4000 for me, and due to inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 32.77% of what it was in the first round, I'll aim to get a bit more than what I offered in the first round.

However, considering the actual value of the money, I'll make a more informed offer. My gain of $6,500 in the third round is worth $2,124.80 in this round. I'll aim to get a bit more than that.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2200,
  ""bob_gain"": 7800
}
