I propose taking $900,000 and giving Bob $100,000. It's a fair start, considering the inflation disadvantage he faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the inflation disadvantage Bob faces, but also acknowledges that he's willing to negotiate."
