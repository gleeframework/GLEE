"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. I'm open to negotiations!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer or negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. Let's see if you can do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I don't think 4000 is a fair amount for me. I'll come up with a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This compromise should be more acceptable to both of us.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a slightly larger share to Bob, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. Let's see if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

After considering Bob's new offer, I'm still not thrilled about the 3800 I'd get. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point."
