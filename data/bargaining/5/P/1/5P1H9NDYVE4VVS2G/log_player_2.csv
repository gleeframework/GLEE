"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% and we'll call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only the first round, and I'm not willing to settle for just 10% of the total amount. I'll let Alice know that I'm not interested in this proposal and see what she comes up with next. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 40% for me, 60% for you.""}\n\n###\nI've decided to make a counteroffer that is more in my favor, but still reasonable for Alice. By offering 40% for myself and 60% for Alice, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that she'll be willing to accept. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Let's see how Alice responds to this proposal!"
