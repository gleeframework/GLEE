60.0,40.0,"Bob, I understand starting with a fair split seems reasonable, but the inflation is significant for me. I'm losing value with each round.  I'm willing to stick with my previous offer of 60/40. ",Alice,3,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, the inflation is really working against me here. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need you to meet me closer to my last offer. 55/45 seems fair considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I'm concerned about the rapid inflation affecting you. I'm willing to give you 40% to help alleviate the pressure, but I need a larger share to ensure I get a fair return as well.  Let's see if this works for us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is eating away at my share, and I need to take action. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",Alice,7,
