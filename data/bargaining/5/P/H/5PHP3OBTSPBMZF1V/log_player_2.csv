Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money is worth the same for me (Bob) as in the first round, but for Alice, it's worth 19% less than in the first round due to inflation.

### Step 2: Review previous offers and responses
- Round 1: Alice offered 5000 for both, which I rejected.
- Round 2: I offered 6000 for myself and 4000 for Alice, which she rejected.
- Round 3: Alice offered 5500 for me and 4500 for herself, which I rejected.

### Step 3: Consider the impact of inflation on Alice's gain
Since the money loses value for Alice with each round (10% less each time), and she has already lost 19% of the value, she might be more inclined to accept a slightly better offer than the last one she made but not as high as my previous offer.

### Step 4: Calculate a new offer
Given the pattern and considering the pressure of inflation on Alice's side, I'll offer her a bit more than what she offered me last time but less than what I offered her last time to try and find a middle ground that is favorable to me.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer
Offer Alice 4200, which is slightly more than her last offer to herself (considering the decreasing value for her), and take 5800 for myself. Attach a message suggesting that this is a compromise considering the decreasing value of money for her.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair compromise for both of us.""}"
