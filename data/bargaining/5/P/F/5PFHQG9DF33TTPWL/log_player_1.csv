{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Hi Bob, let's start with a simple offer. I propose I take $60 and you get $40. It's a good deal for you right now, considering the inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need more than $40 to make it worthwhile for me. Let's split it $55 for me, $45 for you.  This takes into account the inflation, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
