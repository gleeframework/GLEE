"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $7,000 in the first round is now worth $5,600 in the second round.

Bob's offer is $6,000 for me and $4,000 for him, which is less than what I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my $5,600 from the second round is now worth $4,480 in the third round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $4,000 and Bob gets $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my initial $7,000 in the first round, considering the 20% inflation in each round:
Round 1: $7,000
Round 2: $7,000 * 0.8 = $5,600
Round 3: $5,600 * 0.8 = $4,480
Round 4: $4,480 * 0.8 = $3,584

Considering this, I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision. However, I'll think about Bob's offer.

Bob's offer is $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him. This is a better offer than what I initially proposed, and it's a significant increase from the previous round. I'll accept this offer.
