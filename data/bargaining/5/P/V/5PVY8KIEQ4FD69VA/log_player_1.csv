"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split, but I'm hoping we can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the $6,000 I would have gained in the first round is now worth $4,800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still a bit disappointed that I wouldn't be getting a larger share, but I think it's a fair offer. I'll accept it.
