"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

For me, $600,000 is 60% of the original amount, and $400,000 is 40% of the original amount. I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than 50% of the original amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of the original amount for me (due to 2 rounds of 20% inflation) and 80.25% of the original amount for Bob (due to 1 round of 5% inflation).

Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering Bob $600,000 and keeping $400,000 for myself."
