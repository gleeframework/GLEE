Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  This offer is a fair compromise that allows us to secure a significant amount. It's time to reach an agreement and stop losing value. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I accept your offer.  It's not ideal, but we both need to cut our losses at this point.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is becoming more agreeable as time goes on.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money significantly decreases for both players.  While Alice is affected more, waiting for a drastically better offer is risky.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better offer in later rounds has a significant downside. If an agreement isn't reached, Alice risks losing everything.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems to be sticking around this offer range.  It's unlikely he'll suddenly offer something drastically different, especially with time pressure. 

It's a tough decision, but in this scenario, accepting is the more logical choice, even if it doesn't feel perfect from Alice's perspective."
