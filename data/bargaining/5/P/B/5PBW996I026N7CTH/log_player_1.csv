I propose to take 999,999 dollars and leave Bob with just 1 dollar.  I'm confident he'll accept this in the first round, as getting something is better than nothing."

I'm increasing Bob's share to 3 dollars. I'm aiming for a pattern where I offer him one more dollar each round. With a limited number of rounds, I believe this will eventually be good enough for him to accept, even if it means sacrificing a little more than I initially hoped for."
