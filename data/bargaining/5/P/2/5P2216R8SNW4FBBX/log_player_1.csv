"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money.  I think it's important to establish a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is being greedy, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of the situation. I'll reject his offer and make my own in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share a bit, but I'm still aiming for a majority.  I think this is a fair compromise considering Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is getting more reasonable, and with inflation, this is probably the best deal I can get at this point.  It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
