"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, given the inflation rates. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60-40 split in Bob's favor is fair, especially considering the inflation rates. I'd like to make a counteroffer."

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting 45% of the remaining $10,000, which is $4,500, and Bob getting 55%, which is $5,500."
