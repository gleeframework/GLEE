"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair deal considering the current state of the economy. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 500,000 is now worth 450,000.

I'm not interested in a 50/50 split, I'd rather try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.
