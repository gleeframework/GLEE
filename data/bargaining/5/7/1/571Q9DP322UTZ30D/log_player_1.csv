"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and I get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice is proposing to take $60 and give Bob $40, with the message ""Let's be fair and I get a bit more""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get more in the long run if we start with a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have nothing to lose by waiting. Additionally, Bob's gain is worth 5% less in each round, so the longer we play, the more he has to lose. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take $58 and give Bob $42. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less in each round, the actual value of his gain is decreasing. I'm taking this into account and making an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than my previous one. I'm also trying to appear willing to compromise, in the hopes that Bob will accept this offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to get this done before the inflation eats away more of our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I still think I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means he's losing more and more value as the game goes on. I'm not feeling the same pressure, since the money is worth the same to me in each round. I'll try to take advantage of Bob's desperation and make an even more favorable offer in the next round. Additionally, Bob's offer of 45-55 is not significantly better than his previous offer, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on a good deal by rejecting it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I'm being generous, considering the circumstances""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take $57 and give Bob $43. Given that Bob's gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm actually being quite generous by offering him a relatively large share of the money. However, I'm trying to appear magnanimous in my message, in the hopes that Bob will be grateful for my ""generosity"" and accept the offer. In reality, I'm just trying to take advantage of Bob's desperation and get a good deal for myself."
