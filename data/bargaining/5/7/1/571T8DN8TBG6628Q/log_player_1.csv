Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair and simple solution that avoids further potential inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
