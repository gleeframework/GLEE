"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60, you get 40.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still a reasonable amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share. It's a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 10% less, so I'd be getting $18 (20 * 0.9) instead of $20.

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55, it's a fair share considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lion's share, you can have a tiny piece. It's a generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'd be getting $7.10 (10 * 0.711, accounting for the 27.1% decrease in value) if I accept. It's not a great deal, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher share to account for the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, considering the inflation.""
}
