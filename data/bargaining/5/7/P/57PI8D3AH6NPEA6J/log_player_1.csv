"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, but I'll give you a small share to start.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This is the fairest way to divide the money, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the offer is still quite generous on Bob's part.

However, I'm not convinced that splitting the money evenly is the fairest way, especially since the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'd like to propose an alternative.

I reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain to make up for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more unequal split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is straightforward, explaining my reasoning for the offer."
