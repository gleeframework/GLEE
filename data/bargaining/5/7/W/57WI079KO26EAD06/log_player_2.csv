Alice's offer:

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this split is more fair, and it gives us both a good amount. Let's end the game here.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair and equal split. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the 50/50 split now, as inflation will continue to eat away at the potential gains if we keep rejecting offers."
