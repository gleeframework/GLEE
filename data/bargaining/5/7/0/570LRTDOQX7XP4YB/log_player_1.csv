"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a small portion. I'm aiming to secure a large share while acknowledging that Bob also needs to receive something to be incentivized to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me. While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation would make any further rounds significantly less profitable for me. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial portion of the money."
