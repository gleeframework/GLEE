"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not getting a great deal, but I don't want to give up too much more.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal if you don't take this!""
