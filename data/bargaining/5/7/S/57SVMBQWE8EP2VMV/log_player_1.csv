"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting and getting even less.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
