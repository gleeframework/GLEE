"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, aiming to secure the lion's share of the money. However, it's important to remember that each round the money will lose value. If Bob rejects this offer, Alice may need to offer him more in the next round to avoid losing too much due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, accepting this offer is the best option. In the next round, I would have to offer Bob more than 50% to secure his agreement, and the inflation would further diminish my gains.  By accepting this offer, I get a reasonable share of the money and avoid the risk of losing more due to inflation."
