60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  I think this is a fair deal that allows us both to benefit.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share, is more fair.  We both get a good amount, and we can move on to other things.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering it was my turn to propose. How about a 55/45 split? It's closer to the middle ground and still a decent amount for both of us, especially with inflation eating away at the value.",Alice,3,
