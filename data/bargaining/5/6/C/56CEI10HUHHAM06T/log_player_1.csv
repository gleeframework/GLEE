"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly better offer for me, still leaving you with a decent share 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth 10% less for me, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 630,000 (600,000 / 0.9)
* Bob's gain: 400,000

I'm not thrilled about the 6:4 split, but I think it's a slightly better offer than the 7:3 I proposed earlier. I'll accept this offer.
