"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  My turn now, and time is money - especially with inflation eating at our shares! This offer is highly advantageous to me, but still gives you a decent sum. Take it before it shrinks further! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
