"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to take $9000 and let Bob have $1000.  It's a good starting point, and if he rejects, I know I can offer him a little more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split so early in the game, especially with inflation working against us. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm offering Bob $2500 and keeping $7500 for myself. I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I should get a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take something, I'm confident I can get a better deal later. Bob is clearly trying to push for a 60/40 split, but I believe I can negotiate a more favorable outcome with a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself.  I'm willing to concede a little more ground, but I still believe I deserve the larger share, especially given the dwindling value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even though the money is losing value rapidly, I refuse to settle for such a lopsided split. I'm confident that if I keep playing strategically, I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  With the money losing value so quickly, I'm willing to accept a more even split to ensure we both get something.  I think this is the best compromise considering the situation."
