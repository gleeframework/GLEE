"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% and keep 60%. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and ensures we both get an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll get $5,400 instead of $6,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is the best option for me. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round, so I'll get $4,860.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55% for me and 45% for you?""
}
```"
