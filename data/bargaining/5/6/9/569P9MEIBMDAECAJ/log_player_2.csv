"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While getting something is better than nothing, I'm willing to bet Alice will be more reasonable in later rounds as the stakes get higher."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a fair split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly. I'm getting tired of this game! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally being somewhat reasonable, and the penalty for waiting is starting to get significant. It's better to accept this decent offer now than risk getting less later."
