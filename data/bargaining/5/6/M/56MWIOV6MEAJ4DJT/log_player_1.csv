"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a solution where we both benefit. How about we split it evenly? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, the actual value of the money is $8,000, and I don't think it's fair that Bob gets more than me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more even split""
}\n\nThe money is now worth 20% less than the original amount for the second time, so I've adjusted my offer to reflect this. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
