"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more as I am at a disadvantage with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it. The inflation disadvantage is a factor, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money closer to 55/45 in my favor, considering the inflation effect.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a decent deal considering the inflation is only getting worse for me. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher amount, Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation disadvantage she faces. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and further rounds could lead to even lower amounts for me due to the inflation."
