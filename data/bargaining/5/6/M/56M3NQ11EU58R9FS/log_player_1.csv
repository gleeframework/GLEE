"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $6000, but Bob's gain of $4500 is now worth 10% less due to inflation, making it effectively $4050.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
