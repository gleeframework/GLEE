"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 1000 and let's negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This is a relatively small amount for Bob, so he might be motivated to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair start, and we can both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, which means I'll get $5,000 and Bob will get $5,000. This is a fair offer, but considering the inflation, Bob's gain is effectively worth 5% less than mine. I might be able to do better in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split the money evenly, I'll try to take a bit more this time. I'll offer him a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You could have taken the even split in round 2, but I'll give you a chance to negotiate further. Take 4000 and let's see what you've got.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 this time, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more to try and reach an agreement. Let's meet in the middle at 4500 for me and 5500 for you. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take its toll on Bob's offer. His gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means he's getting less and less in real terms.

Bob's offer to meet in the middle at $4,500 for him and $5,500 for me is a reasonable compromise, considering the situation. I'll take it.
