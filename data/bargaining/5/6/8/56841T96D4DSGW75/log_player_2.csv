Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which is good for Bob.  While her offers are getting closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor. With each round, the value diminishes for her, making her likely to accept a less favorable deal as time runs out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  It's time to be assertive. The ""take it or leave it"" approach emphasizes the urgency and the diminishing returns.
* **Fairness as Leverage:**  While Bob might hold out for more, a 50/50 split is objectively fair. This can weigh on Alice's conscience, especially as she sees the potential winnings shrink.
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the pressure increases on Alice.  This offer puts the ball firmly in her court and forces a decision."
