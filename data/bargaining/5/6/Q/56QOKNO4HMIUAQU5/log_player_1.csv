"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the next rounds and the inflation affecting us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting me, I'd rather get a bit more now than risk waiting and getting less in the next rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.
