I'm not thrilled about the 20% reduction in value, and I was hoping for a better deal. Meeting halfway is a good start, but I'd like to try to get a better split. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."

Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! I'm not thrilled about the reduced value, and Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. I was hoping to get a better deal, especially considering the reduced value. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."

Oh no, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! I'm not thrilled about the reduced value, but I think I've been negotiating for a while and it's getting late in the game. I'm willing to accept this offer and get what I can. I'll take the $400,000 and hope that it's enough."
