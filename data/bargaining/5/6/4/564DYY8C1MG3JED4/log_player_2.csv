"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get a small share to begin with, but we can negotiate further if you want. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get as much as I can in the early rounds. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Since the money loses value faster for me, I'm hoping we can settle on a compromise that works for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to secure a larger share for myself to account for the faster inflation rate.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's willingness to give me a bit more, the faster inflation rate affecting my share means I'm still losing more value over time. Considering the adjusted values, I believe there's room for further negotiation to achieve a more balanced division. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a better compromise."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm trying to find a balance that acknowledges the faster devaluation of my share. This offer aims to meet Alice halfway while accounting for the differing inflation rates. Let's see if this compromise works for both of us.""}"
