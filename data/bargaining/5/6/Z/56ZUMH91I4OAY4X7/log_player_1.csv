"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get this over with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less than the original amount, I'll consider the actual value he's proposing:

Alice gain: 400000 (worth 95% of the original 500000)
Bob gain: 600000 (worth 95% of the original 630000)

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. I'll try to negotiate further.

Alice gain: 300000 (worth 60% of the original 500000)

The actual value of Bob's offer is even more skewed towards his side due to the increased inflation. I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'll consider it.
