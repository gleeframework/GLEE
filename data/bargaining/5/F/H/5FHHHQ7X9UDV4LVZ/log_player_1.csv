I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a straightforward and fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or decline!"

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's share, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a compromise, I'm not willing to give up a significant 20% of the total to Bob, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a slightly more extreme proposal, I still don't think I'm getting a fair deal. The 20/80 split is too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better share."

The 10/90 split is extremely skewed in Bob's favor, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better share.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 90/10, I'll try to counter with an even more aggressive proposal to try to get a better deal. However, I'll also consider the fact that I'm running out of time and the value of the money is decreasing. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's an extremely aggressive proposal, I still don't think I'm getting a fair deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's an extremely aggressive proposal, I still think I can do better. The 1/99 split is extremely skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share of the remaining money. I'll try to make one final push for a better deal."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With only 1 round left, I'll make a final offer that's as aggressive as possible to try to get a better deal.
