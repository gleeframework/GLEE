"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my 40 dollars are now worth less than 50 dollars were in the first round, but I'm still getting a bigger share than Bob.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll try to get a bigger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less now, I need to think carefully about this offer. Since I'm getting a smaller share, I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

However, considering that the money is worth significantly less now, I think I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
