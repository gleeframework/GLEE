"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the fairness in the proposal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 50/50 is a fair split, Alice. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 45 dollars.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good one, considering I'm giving up 5 dollars (or 5% of the original amount) more than I did in the first round. However, 50/50 is a fair split, and I don't want to risk losing more money by rejecting the offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
