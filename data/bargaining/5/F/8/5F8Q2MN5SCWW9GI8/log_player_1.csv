"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. The message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still trying to get a good deal for myself 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is not good enough for me. I'd like to see a more generous offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 65/35 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but still in my favor. The message is a hint that I'm not willing to give up much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I still think I deserve a better deal 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a bit more generous than my previous offer, I still think I can do better. The fact that Bob is getting 45% of the total is closer to what I initially proposed, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'd like to see a more significant concession from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no more games""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the $100. The message is a hint that I'm willing to compromise and end the negotiations on a neutral note."
