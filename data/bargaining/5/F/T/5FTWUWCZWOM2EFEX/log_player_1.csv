"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Fair share, let's be friends""
}
```
I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a friendly message to encourage him to accept. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try and get a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to take that into account when making my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Last chance before it's worthless""
}
```
Since the money is losing value quickly, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept this offer before it's too late. Let's see if it works!"
