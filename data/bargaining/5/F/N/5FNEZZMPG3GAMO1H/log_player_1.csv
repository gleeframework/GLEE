"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split in round 1, but now it's not so fair. I'll give you less, but it's still a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'll reject this proposal and make my next offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. Consider this a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming for a slightly larger share for myself."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to feel like Bob is not serious about finding a mutually beneficial solution. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him a larger share than I proposed in Round 3.

I'll reject this offer and make my next proposal.

  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need a bigger chunk to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.""

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate to get a deal done. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him a slightly larger share than I proposed in Round 5.

I'll reject this offer and make my next proposal.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw. We're not going to get a better deal than this. Meet me halfway and we can finally split the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept and we can end the game."
