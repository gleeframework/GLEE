"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk too. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's not a bad starting offer, but I can do better by rejecting and forcing Alice to make a counter offer in the next round. The money will be worth less to me after the next round, but it's worth trying for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
