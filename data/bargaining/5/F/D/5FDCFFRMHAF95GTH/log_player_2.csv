**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but time is working against me more than her.  While this offer is getting close to a point where I should consider it, I need to hold out a little longer to try and secure a better deal before inflation eats up too much of my potential gain."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is your problem, not mine! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. Inflation is severely eating into my potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, rejecting it carries a significant risk. If I reject and Alice continues to lowball me, the effects of inflation will leave me with a pittance in later rounds. It's better to secure something now than risk ending up with nothing."
