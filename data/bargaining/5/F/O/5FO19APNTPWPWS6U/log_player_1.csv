"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can both get some money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased, but I still need to get as much as I can.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to keep a larger share of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
