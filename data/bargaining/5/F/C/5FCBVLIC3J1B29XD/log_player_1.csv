"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, it's a good starting point. Let's see if you can do better next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of 400k is worth 80% of the original 500k I was offered in round 1, so I'm actually losing 20% of the value. On the other hand, Bob's gain of 600k is worth 90% of the original 666.67k he was aiming for in round 1, so he's gaining a bit more than he was initially aiming for.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation in mind, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still willing to compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit more. But I'm not giving away the farm! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of 450k is worth 45.5% of the original 500k I was offered in round 1, so I'm actually gaining less than I was initially aiming for. On the other hand, Bob's gain of 550k is worth 82.5% of the original 666.67k he was aiming for in round 1, so he's still gaining a significant amount.

However, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the continued inflation. I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to meet you halfway!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, neither am I. I'll meet you at the middle, but I'm not going to give up my advantage. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like we're stuck in a stalemate! Considering the inflation, my gain of 475k is worth 47.5% of the original 500k I was offered in round 1, so I'm actually gaining less than I was initially aiming for. On the other hand, Bob's gain of 525k is worth 78.75% of the original 666.67k he was aiming for in round 1, so he's still gaining a significant amount.

However, I think I've been too aggressive in my previous offers, and Bob is now trying to meet me at the middle. I'll consider this offer carefully. Since I'm already gaining less than I initially wanted, I might as well accept this offer and get something rather than risk losing even more value in the next round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
