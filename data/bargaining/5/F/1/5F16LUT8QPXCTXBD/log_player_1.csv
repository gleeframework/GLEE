"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that! Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: $60 x 0.9 = $54
* Bob's gain: $40 x 0.95 = $38

Bob's new offer is a 50-50 split, which is a significant increase in his share. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 10% less than in Round 2 for me and 5% less for Bob. So, the effective values are:

* My gain: $54 x 0.9 = $48.6
* Bob's gain: $38 x 0.95 = $36.1

I'll make a new offer, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob was willing to compromise in Round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a better share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are adding up!

Let's calculate the effective values for Round 4:

* My gain: $60 x (1 - 0.271) = $41.64
* Bob's gain: $40 x (1 - 0.1426) = $34.21

Considering the effective values, Bob's new offer is a 48-52 split, which is actually a slight increase in my share compared to the original offer. However, I'll have to think carefully about whether it's enough to accept.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
