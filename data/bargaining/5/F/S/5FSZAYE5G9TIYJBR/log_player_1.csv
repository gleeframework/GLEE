Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. I'll take 70% and you can have 30%. This is my final offer.

# Bob gain: 700000

``` 
At this point, it's better to accept Bob's offer.  While the inflation has significantly lowered the value of the money,  it's still better to get 300,000 than risk getting nothing at all if Bob continues to reject offers."
