"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I think this is more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob has made a counteroffer of $45 for me and $55 for himself, with the message ""I understand you want to be fair, but I think this is more balanced"", I will decide whether to accept or reject this proposal. Considering the impact of inflation, which reduces the value of the money by 5% in each round, I will respond with my decision.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI have decided to reject Bob's offer. Now it's my turn again to make a new proposal in the next round. Remember, the money will be worth even less due to inflation. Let's proceed to Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, considering the inflation that has reduced the value of the money by 10% so far, I will make a new proposal for dividing the $100. My offer will take into account the need for a compromise that acknowledges the decreasing value of the money, while also aiming to find a mutually acceptable division.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nI have proposed a division of $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground"". This offer aims to balance our gains while factoring in the loss of value due to inflation. Now, it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this proposal or proceed to the next round."
