"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to start, but don't get too comfortable!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split, giving me $80 and Bob $20. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'm not settling for that little. I want more! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not sure if I want to give up 40% of the remaining money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable giving up that much, Bob. Let's see what you've got for Round 3!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need to get a bigger share before the money disappears!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70:30 split, giving me $70 and Bob $30. Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about getting a good deal. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings! Meeting in the middle might not be the worst idea, considering the decreasing value of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I'll meet you in the middle. Let's end this and get what we can!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's 50:50 offer, and we'll split the remaining $100 evenly."
