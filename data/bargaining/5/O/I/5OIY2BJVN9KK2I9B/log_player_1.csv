"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will be happy with a smaller share and we can end this quickly.  I'm assuming the inflation is the same for both of us, so I'm leaving him with a small amount to hopefully avoid conflict."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation rate is working against me, and if I reject this offer, the next round will give me a smaller share, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything at all in the following rounds."
