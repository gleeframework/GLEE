"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on, knowing Bob's share will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer seems tempting, it's important to consider the long-term implications. Since I'm not losing value with each round, I can hold out for a better deal.  Bob's share will continue to decrease, making it more likely I'll get a larger portion later on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly. I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to concede a bit to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting again.  The declining value of his share should incentivize him to accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse.  While his share is decreasing, mine isn't, so I can afford to wait for a better offer.  The longer we go on, the more he'll need to compromise to get any value at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but not by much.  Bob's share is getting increasingly devalued, so this offer should still be attractive to him.  However, I'm also not giving up too much, as I want to ensure I secure a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  Even though his share is decreasing, my share isn't, so I can hold out for a better deal. I'm confident that I can secure a larger portion of the money by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, but I'm trying to be strategic.  Bob's share is rapidly decreasing, and this offer gives him a decent amount while still securing a large portion for myself.  I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the first time Bob has offered an even split. While my ideal outcome would be to receive more, the continuous decrease in Bob's share makes this a good opportunity. Accepting ensures I get a significant amount, and any further rounds could result in a smaller share for me due to Bob's shrinking potential gain."
