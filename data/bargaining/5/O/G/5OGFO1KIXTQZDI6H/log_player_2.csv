Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share.  Inflation is hurting you more, so we should find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While 200,000 is a significant sum, accepting now sets a bad precedent and shows I'm desperate.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but this is my final offer.  Inflation is hurting you more, but I need a good share to make this worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is playing hardball, but this offer is still unacceptable. While the pressure of inflation is on, accepting a mere 25% when I could have had 10 times that in the first round is foolish. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means going down to the wire."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 700000

This is incredibly frustrating!  Alice is completely fixated on that 70/30 split.  While 300,000 is still a significant amount of money, accepting now would feel like a complete cave to her stubbornness. I'm betting she'll be more willing to negotiate when she realizes I'm serious about running the clock down."
