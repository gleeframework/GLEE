"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100. I'm keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not giving up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63
* Bob gain: 30 * 0.9 = 27

I'll accept Bob's offer.
