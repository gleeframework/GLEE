"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""My turn to propose a split. Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Both our potential gains decrease each round. It's in our best interest to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Fairness:** While Alice's initial offer wasn't terrible, it heavily favored her. My offer is a more balanced approach. 
* **Future Rounds:**  If Alice rejects this offer, she knows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value my share. This might make her more receptive to a compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly in my favor 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** The longer this goes on, the less our potential gains are worth. This offer is very close to her original offer, but the impact of inflation makes it more appealing now.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds isn't worth the risk of getting an even worse offer or seeing the value of the money diminish further. 
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems set on getting a larger share. Her counter-offer, even with a slight concession, suggests she's not going to budge much."
