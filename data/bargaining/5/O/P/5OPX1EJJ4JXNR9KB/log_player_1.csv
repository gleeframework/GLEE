"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80-20 split in favor of Alice. This offers a significant advantage in the early rounds before inflation impacts the value of the money.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a more equitable division, and it allows us both to receive a substantial sum before inflation significantly erodes the value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
