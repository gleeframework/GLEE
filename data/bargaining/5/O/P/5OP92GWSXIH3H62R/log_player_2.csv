Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time with negotiations. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit from this deal before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
