"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I will {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer. I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since my share would be worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I will {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer. The offer is getting closer to a 50-50 split, and considering the reduced value of my share due to inflation, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'll take the 45% and end the game."
