Alice's offer is still unfair, and it's better to see what she offers in the next round.  The declining value of her money might motivate her to make a more reasonable offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still leaving a significant portion for Alice. With the inflation, her money is worth significantly less now, and it's crucial to find a compromise to avoid both of us getting nothing."

``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still significantly skewed in her favor. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is starting to hit Alice hard, so hopefully, she'll feel the need to compromise."

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
``` 
I'm increasing my share again, but I'm still offering Alice a substantial portion of the money. The inflation is hitting Alice hard, so I believe this is a fair offer that she should accept before it's too late."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 271000 
# Alice gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still unfair, even with the inflation. I'm going to keep pushing for a more even split.  She is losing money fast, so I believe she will start to compromise in the next few rounds."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice a slightly larger share than before, but the inflation is really starting to bite for her, so I think she'll be more willing to accept a more even split."

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 343900 
# Alice gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too lopsided in her favor, even with the significant impact of inflation on her share. The game is nearing its end, and I'm confident that she'll need to make a more substantial concession in the next round to avoid getting nothing. I'm sticking to my strategy of increasing my share gradually and waiting for her to make a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

With only two rounds left, the inflation is starting to really hurt Alice.  I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the circumstances.  Hopefully, she'll accept before it's too late and we both get nothing."
