Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a bold strategy here. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm going to try and grab the vast majority of the money. If Bob rejects, we'll see what happens in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's a significant improvement from the previous round.  The inflation factor means I don't know how the money will be valued in future rounds.  It's better to take the 500,000 now and be certain of it."
