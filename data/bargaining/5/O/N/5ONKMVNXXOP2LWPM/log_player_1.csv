"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit less than half, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game here, considering the inflation penalty he'll face if we continue."

# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more equitable split. This offer considers the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000

I've increased my share, considering that Bob's portion will be worth even less due to inflation in the next round. I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation."
