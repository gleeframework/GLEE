Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers. Inflation is really hurting your share now. 
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than 50% is not in my best interest. There's still a chance Alice will offer a better deal to avoid reaching a stalemate where we both get nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""It's clear we both want a larger share. This is a compromise to avoid getting nothing in the final round.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  This is the penultimate round. If we don't reach a deal now, we'll be forced into a decision in the final round where Alice has maximum leverage due to the inflation disadvantage.
* **Potential Losses:**  If we don't reach a deal, we both get $0. It's crucial to emphasize that we both lose out in that scenario.
* **Concession:** Offering 45/55 shows a willingness to compromise, even though it's less than my previous 50/50 offer. It might be enough to get Alice to agree.

This offer is a calculated risk. It aims to secure a reasonable share before the final round where Alice might be tempted to offer even less."
