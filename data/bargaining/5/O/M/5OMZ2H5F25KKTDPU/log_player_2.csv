"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm also aware of the inflation factor, so I want to maximize my gains before the money loses value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm offering Alice 40 dollars, and keeping 60 for myself. This is a significant improvement over her initial offer, and hopefully enough to incentivize her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a big factor. With each round, the money I receive is worth less. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, considering the circumstances."
