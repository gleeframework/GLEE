"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad counteroffer from Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a bit more for myself."
