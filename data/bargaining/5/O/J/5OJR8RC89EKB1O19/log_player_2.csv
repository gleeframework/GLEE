"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this small amount and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and 1000 dollars is a ridiculously small amount. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept a deal that's heavily skewed in your favor. This is a fair split given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, 450,000 is a significant amount, and with the inflation, the value of money is diminishing. It's better to take the offer than risk getting nothing in the next round."
