"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the numbers are now:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500

I'd rather get a better deal than this. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than the original $10,000 (20% less in Round 1 and another 20% less in Round 2), I'll aim for a slightly better ratio this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
