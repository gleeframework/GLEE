"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have gotten more in round 1, now it's my turn to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is good enough. I was willing to give him $5,000 in the first round, and now he's only offering me $4,000? I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and holding out for a better deal."
