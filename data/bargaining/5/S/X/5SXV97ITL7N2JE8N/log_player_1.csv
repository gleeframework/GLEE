"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a straightforward and fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 70% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob!

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to give up 40% of the initial amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor this time.""
}
```

Your turn again!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being more realistic now, but still want a decent share.""
}
```

Your turn again, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take 85% 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

I'll reject this offer as well. 15% is not enough for me to live on, let alone 10% of the original amount.

```
