"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 in my favor.  This is a good starting point, what do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split, it's more reasonable considering the inflation rate""}\n\nI'm making this offer considering that the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this 50/50.  Inflation is hitting us both, so a fair split seems the most logical now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation rate and the fact that the money is worth 19% less for me and 36% less for Alice, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable offer. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation."
