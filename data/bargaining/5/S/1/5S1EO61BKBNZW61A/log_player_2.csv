Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This offer is better than anything you'll get in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a lifeline. Grab it before it's too late. This is your last chance for a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to significantly hurt. Accepting a slightly less favorable deal now is better than risking even less in future rounds."
