Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This offer is much fairer for me. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's end this. This is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me.  While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, I need to show her I'm willing to walk away.  The rounds are ticking by, so the pressure is on her to offer a larger sum to me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm being very generous here. This is the best you'll get.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the inflation eats away at your share even more! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, this is getting ridiculous. While I'd like a larger share, the inflation is eating into my potential gains rapidly. Accepting $400,000 now is better than risking getting even less as the rounds progress. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed money."
