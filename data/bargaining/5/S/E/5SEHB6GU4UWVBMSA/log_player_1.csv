Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very high initial offer for myself, leaving Bob with a small amount. I figure he'll likely reject it, as it's not a fair split.  This will give me a chance to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer split than the first round. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, accepting this offer guarantees a significant amount for me, and it's unlikely that Bob will make a more favorable offer in the next round."
