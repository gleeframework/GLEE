"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. The message is a friendly way to soften the blow, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Let's be smart and agree to this before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to be more cautious. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll be getting $45 in the second round, which is equivalent to $56 in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now, as I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effecting the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the second round, I'll be getting $36 in the third round, which is equivalent to $56 in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a risk, Bob! I'm offering 60/40, let's see if you'll take it!""
}
```"
