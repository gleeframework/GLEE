"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. You can do better in the next round, I'm sure.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a different split. How about I take 450,000 and you receive 550,000? This offers a more balanced distribution compared to the previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I need to re-evaluate the offer.

My gain of $550,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $440,000 in the first round's value.

Bob's gain of $450,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $427,500 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take 70% of the remaining amount, leaving you with 30%. Let's finalize the deal!""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
