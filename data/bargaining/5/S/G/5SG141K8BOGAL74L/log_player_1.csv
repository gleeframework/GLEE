Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too much""
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a larger share of the pie!

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too one-sided, I'd like a more balanced split""
}
```

Your turn again, Bob!"

  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit closer to 50-50, but this is a step in the right direction""
