"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after the first round, the total amount left is 10,000 * 0.8 = 8,000$

I'll make a proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
