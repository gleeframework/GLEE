55.0,45.0,Let's start fair! I propose we split it 55/45. I think that's a good starting point.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. How about we try a 60/40 split in my favor this time?  This accounts for the inflation that will affect me more as the game goes on.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split it evenly this time, given the inflation we're both facing.  This is a fair compromise for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
