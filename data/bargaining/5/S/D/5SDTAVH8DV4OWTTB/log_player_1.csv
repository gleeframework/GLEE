```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3,800.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's gain is still $6,000, it's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

```

}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""

  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
