"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the 10% and let's talk.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can start negotiating from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. The 50/50 split is a fair proposal, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
