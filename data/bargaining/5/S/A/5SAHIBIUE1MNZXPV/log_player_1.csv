Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a significant portion of the money.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, and even though the money is worth less due to inflation, it's not enough for me to accept.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, hoping he'll see it's in his best interest to accept before we both lose more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than his previous one, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. I need to get a better deal, or we both risk losing everything!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm making a significant concession to Bob, even though the inflation has hit me hard. Hopefully, this shows him that I'm willing to compromise, and we can finally reach an agreement before we lose too much more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unacceptable.  I'm losing more than 2/3rds of the potential money due to inflation, and his offer is worse than any of his previous offers.  I'm going to fight for a more equitable share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a 50/50 split. I've lost a lot due to inflation, but I'm willing to give Bob half to avoid further losses. This seems like the fairest offer given the circumstances."
