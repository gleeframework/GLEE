"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's time to get a fair share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I was too generous in the first round!

However, I'm not going to fall for it. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a more reasonable offer in the next round, considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to be more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of me, but I'm not afraid to be aggressive. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount, hoping to put pressure on him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being aggressive, but I'm not backing down 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to match my level of aggression!

I'll think carefully about this offer... Considering the inflation, my share is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, and Bob's share is also smaller than his previous offer.

However, I don't want to give up yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make another offer, and I'll try to find a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, trying to take into account the accelerating inflation and trying to be more realistic:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down either. Let's meet in the middle and end this game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping that we can finally reach an agreement."
