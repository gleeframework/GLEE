Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by taking a large share, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept in the first round. I'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the next round."
