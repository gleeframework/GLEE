"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's better to secure a deal now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money evenly, but I'll take $60 and leave you $40 to incentivize you to accept. It's in both our best interests to avoid more rounds and inflation eating away at our money.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was much fairer considering the inflation. Let's compromise - I'll take $55, you take $45.  This deal makes sense for both of us if we want to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
