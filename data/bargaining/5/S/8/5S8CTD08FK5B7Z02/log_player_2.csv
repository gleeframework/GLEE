Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it.

# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is right, things are getting ridiculous.  Inflation is hurting her much more than me at this point. A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
