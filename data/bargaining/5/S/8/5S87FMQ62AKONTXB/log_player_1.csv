"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, $300,000 is now equivalent to $270,000 in the original value. And Bob's gain of $700,000 is now equivalent to $560,000 in the original value.

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is more favorable to me than the previous one. I'll accept Bob's offer.
