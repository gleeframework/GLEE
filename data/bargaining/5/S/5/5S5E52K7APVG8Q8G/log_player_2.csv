Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time with lowball offers. I'm proposing a compromise for us to both benefit significantly. Time is money, and inflation is real!

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation. Let's be sensible and wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly playing tough, but this offer is still unacceptable.  The inflation effect on her end is increasing, so I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more amenable in the next round or two."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit from inflation to make this deal, but we need to settle this now. This is my last offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, and feels risky, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Alice is feeling the pressure, using stronger language and explicitly stating it's her last offer (even though that's not technically true yet).  I believe the inflation effect on her end is big enough now that she'll be much more willing to compromise next round."
