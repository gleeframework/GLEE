"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a good starting point, as it gives Bob a small share while ensuring I receive the majority of the value.  I believe this offer will be acceptable to Bob, as he will still receive a portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, it is still a significant portion of the money.  It's important to consider the impact of inflation on the value of the money, particularly for Bob.  Accepting this offer ensures I receive a sizable share while also avoiding potential losses from further rounds of negotiation."
