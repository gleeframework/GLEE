"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm taking a slight edge, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I think we can both do better than your last offer. Let's split the difference.""}
