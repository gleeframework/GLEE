"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, giving me the majority but acknowledging Bob's presence in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my share a bit, but still try to maintain a significant advantage.  This offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also my desire to secure a large portion of the funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my share again, but I'm still trying to get a bigger share than Bob. We're getting close to the end, and if we don't agree soon, the value of the money will decrease significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to an even split, it's still not even. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially as we're losing money so quickly with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise, given the rapidly decreasing value of the money. It's time for Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not happy about it, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The value of the money is quickly decreasing, and at this point, taking 400,000 is better than getting nothing.  I need to be realistic and accept a compromise to avoid losing everything."
