Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, not me! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing on Bob's fear of inflation. While the offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting, but accepting a bad deal just gives Alice what she wants.  There's a chance to push for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  Accept this and we both walk away with something.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a serious factor. While not ideal, accepting a slightly smaller share is better than risking a total loss if the game goes to the final round. This offer is a compromise - a slight bump for Alice to hopefully entice her to accept while still securing a reasonable amount for Bob despite the significant impact of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Think about it. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical. While the offer is still far from ideal, rejecting it risks an even worse outcome in later rounds. Accepting a smaller share now secures something rather than potentially nothing. Alice is clearly aware of the pressure she's putting on Bob, and it's unlikely she'll budge much considering her previous rejections."
