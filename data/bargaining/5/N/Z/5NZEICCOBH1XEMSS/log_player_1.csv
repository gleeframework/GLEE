Round 2

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Since the money is worth less, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30, but I think I deserve more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, hoping to get a better deal and account for the reduced value of the money."
