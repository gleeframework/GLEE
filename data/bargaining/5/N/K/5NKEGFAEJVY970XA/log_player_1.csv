"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nHow's that? I've offered a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems reasonable given the inflation rates. The message is brief and to the point, encouraging Bob to accept a fair split. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic about the time value of money. This is a good deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, despite Bob's claim of being generous, the split is still not in my favor, especially considering the inflation rate affecting my gain is lower than Bob's. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more realistic split""}\n\nI've adjusted my offer to reflect the changing value of the money, while still aiming for a relatively fair split. The message is a gentle nudge to remind Bob of the inflation's impact and encourage him to accept this revised offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice! This offer is my bottom line - let's settle this now and both come out ahead. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite Bob's claim that this is his bottom line, I'm not convinced. Given the increasing impact of inflation on both our gains, I believe Bob is also feeling the pressure. I'm willing to take a risk and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Bob's message sounds like a bluff, and I'm calling it!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk, but I won't go below this. Inflation is hurting us both, let's be smart""}\n\nI've made a slightly more aggressive offer, considering the increasing pressure of inflation on both sides. My message conveys a sense of determination, implying that I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this offer. At the same time, I'm reminding Bob that we both lose if we can't agree, so it's in his interest to accept a reasonable deal. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it or leave it - we're running out of time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Finally, a 50/50 split! Considering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, I think this is a reasonable offer. Bob's message conveys a sense of urgency and frustration, but the offer itself is fair. I'm willing to accept this deal and split the remaining value of the $10,000 equally. It's time to stop negotiating and walk away with something rather than risking nothing.
