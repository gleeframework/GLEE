Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a risk, but I won't go below this. Inflation is hurting us both, let's be smart 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily chipping away at my potential gains while trying to frame her offers as generous.  It's clear she's more concerned about the impact of inflation on her end. While time is a factor, I need to hold firm for a better deal. Accepting now would set a weak precedent."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it or leave it - we're running out of time!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

After five rounds of posturing, it's time to lay down the law with a firm offer. A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and emphasizing the time crunch (and therefore increasing inflation losses) might push Alice to accept. It's a strong negotiating tactic at this stage."
