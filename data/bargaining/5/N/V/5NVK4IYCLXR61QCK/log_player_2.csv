Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you $450000 and keep $550000 for myself. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a 60/40 split, this is a significant improvement from the previous round.  I'm accepting this offer."
