"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's not a great deal for me. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  Think about it - you get a good chunk, and it's better than waiting for the money to shrink."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a fair share too.  Let's split it 55/45.  This is my final offer.  
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```toolsg
I'm thinking through the reasoning here:

* **The Deal is Getting Worse:**  Both of our potential gains are shrinking each round.
* **Alice is Getting Hurt More:** The money is losing value faster for Alice (20% per round) than for me (10% per round). 
* **Future Uncertainty:** If I reject this, there's no guarantee I can get a better deal from Alice in a future round. She might get even tougher!

**Conclusion:** 450,000 is a decent chunk of money, even with the inflation. It's better to take a reasonable deal now than risk getting even less later.
