"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is very unfair to Bob. While it's better than nothing, Bob can likely get a much better deal by rejecting this and making a counteroffer.  Let's see if we can get more!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair 50/50 split. This way, we can see if Alice is willing to negotiate or if she's aiming for a lopsided deal."
