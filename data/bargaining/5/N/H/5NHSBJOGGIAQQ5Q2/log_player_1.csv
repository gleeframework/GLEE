I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept.  I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing the money will be worth less in the next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While Bob's offer is a lot better than mine, it's still unfair given the inflation.  I know I have the power to reject this offer and propose a different one in the next round, where I'll have a better chance of getting a more equitable split due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  I know the money is worth less now due to inflation, but I'm still aiming for a decent share. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, hoping he sees it as a fairer deal than his last offer."
