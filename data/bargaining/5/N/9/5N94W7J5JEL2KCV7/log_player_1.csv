"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm hoping this is a good starting point for a quick negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher share, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers with inflation.  Accepting 5000 is a better outcome than potentially getting nothing at all in later rounds."
