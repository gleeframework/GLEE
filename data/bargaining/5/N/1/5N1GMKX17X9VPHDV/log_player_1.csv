"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $1000 and take $9000. You can do better next round, I'm sure!""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple approach 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm getting a better deal than I would have if we were splitting it 50/50 in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
