Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, Alice. This accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's meet in the middle. This offer ensures a more equitable split considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to a 50/50 split, but he's doing it very slowly while taking advantage of the fact that the deal gets worse for me every round. I need to hold out for a better offer, even though time pressure is mounting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. Don't let time diminish our gains any further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is getting severe. While I'd ideally like a larger share, I need to make Bob a serious offer to settle quickly. A 50/50 split is the most straightforward and equitable solution at this point."
