"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more even split, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's try to reach an agreement quickly before the value of the money decreases. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $45 * 0.95 = $42.75
* Bob gain: $55 * 0.95 = $52.25

I accept Bob's offer for the time being.
