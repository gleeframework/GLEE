"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the smaller share this round to give you an incentive to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split in my favor this round, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too aggressive, I'd like to see a more balanced split. Let's try to find a middle ground.""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% toll on my gains, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split this round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I think we've reached a reasonable compromise. I'll accept your offer and we can finalize the split.""
