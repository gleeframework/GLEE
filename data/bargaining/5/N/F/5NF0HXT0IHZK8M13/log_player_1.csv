"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than that. Bob's offer is too skewed in his favor, considering the reduced value of money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced this time. Will you accept?""
}
```

I've adjusted the split to give me a slightly larger share, but still keeping it relatively fair. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the rapid inflation, the value of the money is decreasing quickly. I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with this offer, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of money. I'd like to wait for a better offer that takes into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. It's only fair, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems reasonable given the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal."
