"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. 

This is a fair starting point, as it gives Alice a significant majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. It also sets the stage for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000. This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  It recognizes that Bob's proposal was not acceptable, but also acknowledges that we need to find a solution to avoid losing more money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is a significant improvement from the last round and is quite close to an even split. While the value of the money has decreased, accepting this offer is the best strategy to avoid losing more money."
