"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It might be a fair split right now, but the money is worth less to me in later rounds than it is to Alice. I'll see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm going to propose a slightly more even split.  Let's each get closer to 50%. I think that's fairer in the long run.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50 and end this game. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's getting late in the game, and my money is losing value rapidly. I'll accept the 50/50 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing."
