"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low. Let's meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the offer is equivalent to:

```
# Alice gain: 300,000
# Bob gain: 630,000
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
