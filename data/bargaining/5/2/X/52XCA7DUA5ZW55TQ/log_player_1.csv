"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. My message to Bob is to try to establish a fair starting point and give him a small amount to get us started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect you more than me in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's proposal, I think a 60/40 split is indeed more favorable for him, and I'd rather not take on a larger share of the risk. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential gains, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50.""
}
```"
