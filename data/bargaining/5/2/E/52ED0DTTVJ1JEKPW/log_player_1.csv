Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the risk of rejection and the upcoming inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
