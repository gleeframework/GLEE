"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This way, I get a significant chunk of the money upfront, while still giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In this round, the money is worth less than in the previous round, so I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure if I want to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was quite generous, I'll aim to make a more moderate offer this time. Considering the ongoing inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share than before.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than in my initial offer, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! My share is worth significantly less than it was initially.

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. I'm not sure if I want to risk waiting for another round, given the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4."
