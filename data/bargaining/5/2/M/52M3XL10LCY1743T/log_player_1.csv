Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be fair and split it closer to the middle. This is a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
