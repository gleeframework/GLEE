"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I don't think 40% of the reduced value is a good deal for me. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob this time."
