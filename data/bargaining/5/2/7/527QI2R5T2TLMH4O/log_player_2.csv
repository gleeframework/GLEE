"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept a deal where Alice gets 600,000 and I only get 400,000. Let's see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly smaller share than she offered me, but still a significant amount. This should be a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 450000

{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still not good enough. Even though I'm losing 19% of the value with each round, I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm raising my offer to 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Alice.  While I'm losing value with inflation, I'm still hoping for a better split than the previous rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

With inflation hitting my gains hard, I'm going to accept this offer. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting offers, I'll end up with nothing."
