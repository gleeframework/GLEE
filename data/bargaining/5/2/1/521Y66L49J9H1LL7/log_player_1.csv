"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $9,000 in real terms.

I'm not too thrilled about splitting it evenly, but I suppose it's a fair offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can proceed to the next round."
