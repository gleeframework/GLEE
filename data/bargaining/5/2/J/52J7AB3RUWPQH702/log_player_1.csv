"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a chance to match my fair offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would gain in Round 2 is $5,500 (10,000 x 0.9).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 10% inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $9,000 to me. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500."

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would gain in Round 4 is $7,275 (10,000 x 0.7275).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
