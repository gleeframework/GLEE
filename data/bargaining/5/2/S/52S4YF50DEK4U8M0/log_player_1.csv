"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I want a bit more for my efforts! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves a bigger share, huh?

Considering the inflation, the effective value of my share would be 300,000 * 0.8 = 240,000. Still a bit stingy, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to make my next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! I'll give you a bit more, but don't think you can take advantage of me!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still keeping a slight edge. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, I was being greedy! Let's try to find a fair split this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has come back to reality!

Considering the inflation, the effective value of my share would be 400,000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 206,400. Still a bit less than I'd like, but it's a step in the right direction.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a more reasonable split.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
