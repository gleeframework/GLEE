Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

I propose we split the money almost evenly, but with a slight advantage for me.  I believe this is fair, considering I am taking the risk of you rejecting my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving in yet.  Let's see if we can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that I will be taking the risk of your potential rejection."
