"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I now have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I reject Bob's offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim for a slightly better deal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! With the money being worth 14.26% less now, I need to reassess my priorities. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not the best deal I could have hoped for, but it's better than going into further rounds with the money losing value."
