"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to counter! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to squeeze me out! Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get $3000, but for Bob, his gain of $7000 is worth 5% less than in the first round.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for him to take a larger share, I'll try to counter with a more balanced offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain of $4500 is still worth $4500, but Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 14.26% less than the initial $7000, which is $6000 * 0.8547 = $5134.2.

I'll think about it...
