"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk. Accept and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer. 100,000 is a small fraction of the total amount, and I think I can do better in subsequent rounds. Plus, the money is only worth 80% of its original value to me after this round, but I think the potential gain is worth the risk. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Although the money is worth less to me now due to inflation, I think I can still negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
