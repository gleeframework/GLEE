"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, $5,000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round. This is a good offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for $5,000 now. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think about it, but I want more. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 64% of its original value now (80% of 80%). I'll make a new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to secure my share. Accept this and we can end it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than your last offer. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40.8% of its original value now (64% of 63.6%). I'll think about Bob's offer. $5,500 is worth 27.84% of the original $10,000, which is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for it. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.
