Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that.  This offer is more equitable, and gives us both a good chunk of the money. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it.

After calculating the effective value of the money, I realize that the offer is actually quite generous, considering the inflation.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer."
