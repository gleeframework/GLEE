"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 10/90, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split. This way, I'll get a bigger share, but still leave room for Alice to accept.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less now, I'll need to adjust my calculation accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get $20, which is equivalent to $25 in the first round. That's a decent offer, considering the inflation.
