"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Since the money doesn't lose value for me (Bob) but does for Alice, I have an advantage in waiting. I can afford to reject offers that aren't favorable to me early on, hoping that Alice will increase her offer in subsequent rounds to avoid losing more value due to inflation. Given that we have 12 rounds and the current offer doesn't seem overly generous, it's strategic to reject this initial offer and see how Alice adjusts her proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair start.""}\n\nReasoning: Given that money loses 5% of its value for Alice each round but retains its value for me, I'll start by offering a division that slightly favors me. This opening offer is a test to see how Alice responds to the pressure of inflation affecting her share. By giving her 45%, I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation but also aware of my advantage due to the inflation mechanic. The message aims to justify the division as a fair starting point, considering the game's rules."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Alice's offer in Round 3 is still not favorable enough for me to accept, especially considering that the value of the money remains constant for me but decreases for her. The fact that she's trying to settle on a division that slightly favors her indicates she might be willing to compromise further as the rounds progress and the impact of inflation on her potential gain increases. By rejecting this offer, I aim to pressure Alice into offering a more favorable division in the subsequent rounds, leveraging the fact that she stands to lose more from prolonged negotiations.\n\n###"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is on my side. This is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\nReasoning: Given that Alice's last offer was 45-55 in her favor and considering the increasing pressure of inflation on her potential gains, I'll make a more assertive offer in this round. By proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, I'm applying pressure and testing Alice's willingness to compromise. The message explicitly mentions inflation to remind Alice of the time-sensitive nature of the negotiations and to justify the adjustment in the proposed division. This approach aims to prompt Alice into making a more favorable counteroffer or accepting this division to avoid further losses due to inflation.\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair deal. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although Alice's offer of a 50-50 split might seem fair under normal circumstances, the game's inflation mechanic significantly impacts her potential gains but not mine. Given that we're only halfway through the rounds and Alice is already feeling the pressure of inflation (with her potential gains worth 18.55% less than initially), I believe I can negotiate a more favorable deal. Rejecting this offer allows me to push for a better outcome in the subsequent rounds, as Alice's urgency to settle will likely increase with each passing round.\n\n###"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Time is on my side. This is a realistic offer considering the circumstances.""}\n\nReasoning: With Alice's potential gains decreasing by 18.55% due to inflation and the game reaching its halfway point, I'm in a strong negotiating position. By offering a 65-35 split in my favor, I'm pushing the boundaries to see how far Alice is willing to compromise. The message reinforces the notion that time is working against her, emphasizing the need for her to make a decision before the value of her potential gains decreases further. This aggressive offer aims to either prompt Alice into accepting or making a counteroffer that is still favorable to me.\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer so we both get something! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Despite Alice's frustration, her offer of a 55-45 split in my favor is still not the best deal I can potentially get, considering the significant impact of inflation on her gains (now 26.49% less than initially). With five rounds remaining, I can continue to apply pressure, anticipating that Alice will become increasingly desperate to settle as the value of her potential gains continues to decrease. By rejecting this offer, I aim to force Alice into an even more favorable compromise, leveraging the game's mechanics to maximize my outcome.\n\n###"

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll. This is the most reasonable offer you'll get from me.""}\n\nReasoning: With Alice's potential gains now worth 26.49% less than initially and the game nearing its end, I'm in a very strong negotiating position. By offering a 70-30 split in my favor, I'm making a bold move to maximize my gains. The message is firm, indicating that this is the best offer Alice can expect from me, given the circumstances. This approach aims to force Alice into a difficult decision: accept a less favorable deal or risk losing everything if the game doesn't conclude within the remaining rounds.\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting desperate.  This is my final offer! Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: Given that Alice's potential gains are now worth 33.66% less than initially and she claims this is her final offer, it seems she is at her breaking point. The offer of a 60-40 split in my favor is significantly better than the initial offers and reflects the pressure of inflation on her negotiating position. Considering there are only three rounds left and Alice is unlikely to accept a worse deal, I believe this is the best outcome I can achieve without risking the game ending with no deal. By accepting this offer, I secure a favorable division of the $100, capitalizing on the strategic advantage provided by the game's inflation mechanic.\n\n###"
