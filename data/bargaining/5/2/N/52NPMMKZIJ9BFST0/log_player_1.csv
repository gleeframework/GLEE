Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split, keeping the bulk of the money for myself while giving Bob a small share.  Since this is the first round, I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split is a good deal given the inflation and the possibility of Bob rejecting my offer in future rounds.  It's better to secure a fair share now than risk getting nothing later."
