Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is still too lopsided. Let's meet in the middle with a 45/55 split in your favor. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
