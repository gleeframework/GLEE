Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to maximize my share while considering the decreasing value of the money. However, Bob's offer is quite lopsided in his favor, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.
