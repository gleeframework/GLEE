Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty generous offer from Bob, but I'm not going to take it lying down.

```

I'm rejecting this offer. I think I can do better than that!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more attractive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""You can keep a quarter, I'll take the rest, a good compromise?""
}

I'm offering Bob a quarter of the money, which is $250,000, and I'll take the remaining $750,000."
