"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll have to be more cautious due to the inflation. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed, especially considering the money I'd gain is worth 10% less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000
}
```

This offer reflects the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm trying to find a balance that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money I gain is worth significantly less due to the cumulative inflation. Considering the drastic reduction in value, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to accept an offer that gives me such a low amount, especially when the money I gain is worth so much less than in the initial round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 5, the money I gain is worth even less due to the continued inflation. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This offer reflects the further reduction in value due to inflation, and I'm trying to find a balance that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money I gain. In Round 6, I'll have to be extremely cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to accept an offer that gives me such a low amount, especially when the money I gain is worth almost half of what it was in the initial round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob, but I'm starting to get worried that we might end up with a very unbalanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 7, the money I gain is worth a significant fraction of what it was in the first round. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the extreme reduction in value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000
}
```

This offer reflects the drastic reduction in value due to inflation, and I'm trying to find a balance that's acceptable to both of us, considering the current circumstances."
