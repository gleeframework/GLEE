"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair split and we can end the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I think this is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 90% of $300,000, which is $270,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Bob is getting a much larger share than I am, and I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 90% of 90% of $300,000, which is $243,000.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""This is a better deal for you, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: 50/50 split, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $550,000 is now worth 72.9% of $550,000, which is $398,050.

I'm surprised by Bob's 50/50 offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I was hoping to get a better deal than this, but at the same time, it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going to another round.
