Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% reduction in my potential gain due to inflation!

However, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'm not getting a great deal, I'll decide to reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 48.8% reduction in my potential gain. However, I'll think carefully about it. Since I've already rejected a few offers, I might as well try to do better.

After some thought, I've decided to reject this offer as well. I'll keep trying to negotiate for a better deal.

{""alice_gain"": 330000, ""bob_gain"": 670000, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing to give Bob an even larger share, hoping that he'll finally accept. I'm getting a bit worried about the inflation and the value of my potential gain is dwindling fast!

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
