"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you'll get 20%. If you don't like it, we can negotiate further.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm looking for a more balanced split. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already kicking in!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise."
