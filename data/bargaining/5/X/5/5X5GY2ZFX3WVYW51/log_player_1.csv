"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better. The money is worth 20% less now, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round and another 20% less after the second round, it's now worth 40% of its original value.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share to try to get the game over quickly."
