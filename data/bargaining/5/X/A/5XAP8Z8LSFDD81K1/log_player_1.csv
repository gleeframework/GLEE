"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money, you can accept or propose a better deal.""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm starting with a relatively fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will want to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 30% of the money, but it's the best I can do for now 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I was hoping for a better deal, and 30% is still a bit too low for me. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. I'll give you 45% of the money, but I'm not going any lower.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% of the money, but I'm not going any higher 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Bob's offer is slightly better than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. It's not a bad deal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less valuable money.
