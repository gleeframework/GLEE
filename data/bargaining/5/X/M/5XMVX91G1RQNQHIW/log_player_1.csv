Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit imbalanced. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It seems fairer given the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
