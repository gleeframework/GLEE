"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly, or we can play another round and risk losing value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good share and avoid the risk of losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, but Bob's message is tempting. Considering the risk of inflation, I'd rather get a slightly smaller share now than risk losing more value later. I'll accept the offer.
