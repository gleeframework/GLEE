Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round.  I want to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to start with a more even split. I'll give Alice a little less than she proposed, but I'll also get a better deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, it's better than the 19% loss from inflation. This offer gives me a decent amount of money, and with the inflation, it's likely I won't get a better offer in the next round."
