"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. We can always adjust in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor. I can likely get a better deal in the next round, as the money will be worth less for Alice then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the value of money is going down with each round. Let's be practical and secure a good share for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I think we can do better than 60/40. Let's split it 80/20 this time, acknowledging that the money is losing value. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both end up with less. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the last round, it's still not ideal. I'm going to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm hoping to push for a more balanced split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""The money is losing value rapidly, so let's cut our losses and split it evenly. This way, we both get a decent share before the inflation completely eats away at our potential gains.""}
