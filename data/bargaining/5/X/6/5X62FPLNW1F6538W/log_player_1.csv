Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than before, I'd rather get a higher share in terms of the actual amount. I'll reject this offer.
