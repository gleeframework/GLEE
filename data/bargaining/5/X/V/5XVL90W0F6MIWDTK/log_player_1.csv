"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

The 50-50 split might be a good compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.

I'll reject this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, 55-45. It's still a good compromise!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still trying to be reasonable and compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, 55-45. It's a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be more cautious. The 55-45 split is actually quite close to my initial offer, but since Bob is now proposing it, I'm not sure if I should trust him.

I'll reject this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll try to make a stronger case for myself, 58-42. Let's see if you'll bite!""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive move, taking a bit more for myself while still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
