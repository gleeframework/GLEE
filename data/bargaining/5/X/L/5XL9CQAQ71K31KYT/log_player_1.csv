**Reasoning:**

While Bob is ""compromising,"" his idea of compromise still heavily favors him.  It's becoming clear that Bob is banking on my fear of inflation to force a bad deal. It's better to hold out and propose a more reasonable split, as the longer this goes on, the more desperate Bob will become."
