I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation dynamic favors me in the later rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Inflation is a significant factor, and Bob's offer still gives me a decent amount of money. It's unlikely I can get a better deal in the following rounds."
