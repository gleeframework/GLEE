"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money fairly, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This way we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further rounds and the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
