Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm betting she'll be forced to offer even more in the next round to avoid walking away with nothing.  I'm still aiming for a larger share than her initial 60/40 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5050, ""alice_gain"": 4950, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

We're past the halfway point and Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation. I'm sticking to my guns with a slight concession to show I'm being ""generous"". The ""final offer"" message adds pressure for her to accept."
