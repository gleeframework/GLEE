"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
While not ideal, accepting is the best strategic move at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly. Waiting any longer significantly diminishes returns for both players.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is unlikely to offer much better in subsequent rounds, especially given the rapid inflation. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount. 
* **Risk of Getting Less:** If Bob rejects, he risks Alice proposing an even less favorable split in the next round, leaving him with a significantly reduced amount."
