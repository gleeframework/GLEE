"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering future losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm looking to maximize my share. While Alice's proposal is ""fair"" in the sense of a straight split,  it doesn't account for the fact that I lose money more quickly than her.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair split, but I need to secure a larger share to account for the faster inflation I face.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation gap, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is becoming a significant factor. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get something, and it's better than risking losing more in the next round."
