Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a better deal than that.  Let's split it 60/40 this time. Remember, the value of the money is decreasing for me with each round, so I need to make sure I get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now. While her offer is better, it's still skewed in her favor.  There's a good chance she'll be significantly more agreeable in the next round as the value of her potential winnings continues to decrease."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and the value is slipping away with each round. I'm offering you a 40/60 split.  Let's settle this now and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the Tables:**  I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer. This emphasizes the fairness aspect. 
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm reminding Alice about the shrinking pot, making her current potential gain more appealing.
* **Striking a Balance:**  A 60/40 split in my favor is a strong position, but not so extreme that it completely alienates Alice. There's a good chance she'll accept to avoid further losses."
