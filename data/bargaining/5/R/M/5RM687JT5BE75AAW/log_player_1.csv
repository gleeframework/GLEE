"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to reach an agreement quickly due to inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** I'm starting with a proposal that slightly favors me (Alice). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also establishes a position of strength. 
* **Acknowledging Inflation:** The message directly addresses the inflation issue, emphasizing why a quick agreement is beneficial for both parties. This makes my proposal seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is tilted in my favor, it's not outrageously so.  This signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on your end, I've adjusted the split to slightly favor me while still acknowledging your urgency. This compromise should be more palatable for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob acknowledges the inflation, his offer doesn't reflect its true impact. Even with the adjustment, the deal is significantly worse for me than his initial rejection. 

* **Unfavorable Trend:**  Accepting this sets a bad precedent. It shows Bob I'm willing to accept increasingly worse deals under pressure.
* **Calculation:** Even with inflation, holding out for a better offer in the next round is worth the risk.

**Let's see what he offers in Round 3!**"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your attempt to adjust for inflation, but it still heavily favors you in the long run. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure but also aiming for a fairer split.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Retreat:**  I'm slightly decreasing my demand from Round 1 to signal a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Long-Term Impact:** The message emphasizes that accepting his previous offer would have negative long-term consequences due to inflation.
* **Firm but Fair:** The offer is still a reasonable compromise, especially given the accelerated inflation I face.

I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us, Bob!  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."
