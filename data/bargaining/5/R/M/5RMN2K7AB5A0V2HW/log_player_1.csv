"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, as I'm aware of the inflation factor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm also ready to negotiate if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking a very aggressive stance, offering me a much smaller share.  I'm going to reject this and try to negotiate a more fair deal. I still have plenty of rounds to work with, and the inflation will start to affect him too."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground here. I'm offering Bob a larger share than he offered me, but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, and maybe we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too greedy, and the inflation is starting to hit me hard.  I'm going to continue rejecting his offers until he starts taking this more seriously. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  The inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure a decent share quickly.  This is a fair offer, and I hope Bob will finally realize that we both need to compromise to get anything at all."
