"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... and I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not satisfied with the split, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split this time!"
