I'm taking a large share to start, but leaving a small portion for Bob.  I'll see if he's willing to accept or if he thinks he can get more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting a smaller share than the initial proposal, it's still worth more to me than what I'd get with 10% inflation.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. The inflation has impacted both of us, and this offer is fair considering the previous rounds. Hopefully, Bob will accept and we can both get a decent amount before the money continues to devalue."
