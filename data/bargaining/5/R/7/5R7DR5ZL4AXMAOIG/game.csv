60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  A fair deal for us both to settle this quickly.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Your offer was a bit imbalanced.  Let's split closer to the middle and avoid inflation eating away at our potential gains.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,I understand you want a more balanced deal. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor? This way we both secure a decent amount before inflation takes a bigger chunk.,Alice,3,
