"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, no need to be too greedy 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so the proposal is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too little for me, let's try to get more""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the 50-50 split doesn't give me enough money, considering the reduced value due to inflation. I'd like to propose something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, trying to get a bit more money while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I want a bigger share now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the further reduction in value due to inflation, I need to reassess the proposal. Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer is actually a significant increase in his share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting a good deal, I'll take it""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, in the current value of the money, I'm still getting a decent amount, and Bob is getting a larger share than before. It seems like a fair compromise."
