"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I need to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure if I should accept a lower share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given that the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'm starting to get a sense of Bob's strategy.

Considering the significant inflation effect on my end (14.26% less than the original value), I'm not sure if I should accept a 45% share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money being worth 19.39% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the four rounds), I'll make a more cautious offer. I'll try to get a larger share to account for the increasing inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being consistent in his offers.

Considering the significant inflation effect on my end (22.62% less than the original value), I'm not sure if I should accept a 42% share. However, I'm getting a bit desperate to end the game, so I'll accept this offer.
