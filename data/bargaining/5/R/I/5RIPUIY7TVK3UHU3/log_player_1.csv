"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy last round, now it's your turn to make a compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take a more modest approach this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split, especially since my end of the deal is worth 20% less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being reasonable."
