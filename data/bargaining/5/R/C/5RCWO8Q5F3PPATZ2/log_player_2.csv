Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm serious about getting a fair deal. This offer reflects the time pressure and the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate. She's feeling the pressure of the devaluation and her offers are getting worse for her.  I believe I can push for an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  This is a fair 50/50 split. Take it before the money is worth even less for you.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I believe Alice is getting desperate, it's getting risky to push for a much larger share. Offering a 50/50 split might seem generous at this point, but it guarantees I get a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if Alice continues to reject my offers."
