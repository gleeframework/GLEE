7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the $10000 into $7500 for me and $2500 for you. Let me know if this works for you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair start. Let's see if you can do better.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,I've decided to propose a new division of $6000 for me and $4000 for you. This seems like a more equitable split given the inflation and Bob's previous offer.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I should get a bit more considering the initial offer was quite low. Let's see if you can meet me in the middle.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"I believe we should aim for an equal division given the constraints of inflation. My proposal is for us to split the $10000 evenly, with each of us receiving $5000. This ensures fairness and efficiency.",Alice,5,
