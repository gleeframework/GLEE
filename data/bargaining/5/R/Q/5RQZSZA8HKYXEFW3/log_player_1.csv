"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering Bob 45% of the initial amount, and keeping 55% for myself. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, my effective gain would be 440000 (550000 * 0.8). I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that leaves me with less than what I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (0.8^2), my effective gain would be 396000 (550000 * 0.8^2). I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of money. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% less now (0.8^3), so my effective gain would be 352800 (550000 * 0.8^3). Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that leaves me with less than what I initially proposed. However, I also don't want to risk waiting for a potentially worse offer in the next round. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
