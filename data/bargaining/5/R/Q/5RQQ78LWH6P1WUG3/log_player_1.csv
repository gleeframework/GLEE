I propose to take 900,000 and Bob takes 100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the larger share but it's not an outrageous amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to lower my demand a bit to 600,000.  Bob's offer was way too low, and I'm hoping he'll recognize that we need to split this more evenly."
