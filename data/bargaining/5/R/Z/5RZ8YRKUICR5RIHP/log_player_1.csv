"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $475,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think splitting it evenly is a bit too even, considering the initial offer I made was already generous. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering my initial offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, hoping Bob will see the value in my compromise."

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 is now worth $514,400.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still a bit too low, considering the initial value of the money was $1,000,000. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."

  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm willing to give you a very small share if you're not willing to meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing an 85/15 split, hoping Bob will realize that this is a take-it-or-leave-it offer and accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
