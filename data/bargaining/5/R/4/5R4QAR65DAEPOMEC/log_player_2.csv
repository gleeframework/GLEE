"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 60/40 split is a good starting point, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll wait to see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the inflation we're facing. Let's be reasonable and come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split.  With inflation, it's the best way to ensure we both get something. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I still think I could potentially get a better deal, the inflation is a serious factor. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise and guarantees we both get something."
