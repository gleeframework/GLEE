Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer, hoping Bob accepts. I'll take 90% and leave 10% for him.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is ridiculously unfair!  I'm not going to accept that.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced deal.  I'll take 80% since I'm losing money with each round, but I'll give Bob a chance to make a reasonable profit. Hopefully, he sees the value in ending this now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is still quite uneven, it's clear he's not going to budge much. The inflation is really hurting me at this point, so I'm going to take the 20% and end this game."
