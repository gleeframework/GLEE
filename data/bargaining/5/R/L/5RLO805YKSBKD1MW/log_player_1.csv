# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. This is a one-time offer. Don't let it pass!

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hitting you hard. Let's wrap this up. Take this offer before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is getting worse, accepting this offer would give me less than the offer I proposed in Round 3 (which Bob rejected). It's a clear attempt to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to hold out for a better deal."
