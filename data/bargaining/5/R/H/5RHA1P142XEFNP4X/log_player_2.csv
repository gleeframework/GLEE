Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is practically an even split considering the inflation. Let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is framing it as an even split *after* inflation, it's crucial to remember that inflation only affects her perception of the money, not the actual amount. 

While she might only perceive 5100 as a small amount more than 4900 after the value decrease,  Bob is still losing out on a significant chunk of the initial sum.  We're now past the halfway point in the rounds, and Alice is likely getting desperate. Bob can leverage this in the coming rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, it seems we both want a fair deal. Let's make it simple and split it right down the middle. This is the most logical solution at this point.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've entered the latter half of the rounds, and Alice is getting increasingly desperate, as evidenced by her framing of her last offer.  Offering a true 50/50 split accomplishes a few things:

* **Projects Fairness:** It removes any argument of unfair advantage due to inflation. 
* **Simplicity:**  It's a clear and easy solution in the face of dwindling time and value.
* **Psychological Pressure:**  By offering what is objectively fair, it puts the onus on Alice to either accept a reasonable deal or risk getting significantly less as the rounds progress."
