"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you 10% of the money. This is a fair deal, considering the inflation will hit me harder than you. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. 10% is too low. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split. It's fair considering the inflation, and we can both walk away with a significant amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This is the fairest option for both of us, considering the inflation has already begun to impact my share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  A 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation is going to continue to hurt Alice's share."
