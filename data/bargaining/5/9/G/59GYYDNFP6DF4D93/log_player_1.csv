"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very unequal split.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also trying to understand how the inflation affects him. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair split, and it's better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
