"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  Let's flip the script and make it 60-40 in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a chance!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give you 60-40 in your favor, especially after you rejected my initial offer. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping we can reach a deal!"
