Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** Although I lose 20% of my potential gains from round 1, I'm still getting half the money in round 2. This is a significant improvement from the previous round's offer.
* **Risk:** If I reject, there's a risk that Bob will continue to make offers that are unfavorable to me. Additionally, with each round, the value of the money decreases, potentially leaving me with even less in later rounds.
* **Fairness:** While I would prefer a larger share, 50/50 is a fair and reasonable outcome."
