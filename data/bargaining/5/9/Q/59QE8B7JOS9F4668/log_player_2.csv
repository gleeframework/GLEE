Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nMy proposal for Round 2 is: 60/40, with me getting the larger share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. The value of the money is dropping fast, so a 50/50 split seems like the best option for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think a 50/50 split is a fair deal, especially considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 36% less for Alice compared to the first round, it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds.\n\n###\n\nLet Alice know that I've accepted her offer, and we can conclude the game.\n\n###\n\nThanks!"
