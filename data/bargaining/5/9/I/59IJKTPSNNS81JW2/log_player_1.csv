"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 10% less value of my potential gain, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 2:3 split, especially with my gains being worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding out for a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting now! With my gains worth 27.1% less than the starting value, I'm getting a bit desperate.

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the 3:7 split, but I think it's the best I can get at this point. I'll take the $3,500 and hope that Bob is satisfied with the deal."
