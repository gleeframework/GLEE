"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a classic strategy in ultimatum games, as it leverages the fact that Bob has no other option than to accept if he wants to receive *anything* at all.  I'm taking a gamble that Bob will be rational and accept this offer, as he has a lot to lose by rejecting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob has essentially mirrored my offer from round 1. I'm not going to accept this, because I know that I can hold out for a better deal. If I reject this, I'll get to make the next offer, and I'll be in a much stronger position.  The pressure is now on Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to decrease my proposed take to $900,000, leaving $100,000 for Bob.  This is still a very favorable deal for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept, as rejecting could lead to an even worse outcome for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob has again mirrored my offer. While this offer is tempting, I'm going to stick to my strategy of rejecting and trying to get a better deal. I've already demonstrated that I'm willing to walk away from a deal that's heavily in my favor, and I believe that Bob will eventually realize he needs to offer me more if he wants to secure a deal before we run out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my proposed take, this time offering Bob $200,000.  This offer is still very advantageous for me, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and finally accept an offer before the game runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob has continued to mirror my offers. This strategy is becoming predictable and I'm not going to give in.  I will continue to reduce my offer, hoping to force Bob to realize he needs to be more generous to secure a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, now offering Bob $300,000. We are nearing the end of the game, and I believe that Bob will understand that it's in his best interest to accept this deal rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is still mirroring my offers. I'm going to stick to my strategy. I believe that with only a few rounds left, the pressure will increase on Bob to accept a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer further, hoping that Bob will finally realize that he needs to accept an offer. With only four rounds remaining, the stakes are getting higher for both of us.  I'm confident that Bob will understand that he needs to compromise if he wants to get anything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still mirroring my offers, but we are getting very close to the end of the game.  I'm going to stick to my strategy and reject this offer. I believe that with only three rounds remaining, Bob will be forced to make a more generous offer in the next round if he wants to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm making a significant concession and offering Bob an equal share of the money. This shows that I am willing to compromise and am hoping that Bob will reciprocate, as we are both running out of time."
