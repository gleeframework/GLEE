"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the offer first and the inflation will affect Bob more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a more even split, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  The inflation is going to be a significant factor in future rounds, making it unlikely I'll get a better deal later."
