"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This way, we both get an equal share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd like to try to get a bit more to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is still a good one, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
