"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  With each round, the value of the money drops for me, but I still think there's room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. This way, we both get a good share, and we avoid the risk of losing value with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You proposed a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would have preferred a 50/50 split, I recognize that Alice needs a bigger share for the deal to be acceptable to her. I'd rather get 4000 now than risk getting nothing at all in the end."
