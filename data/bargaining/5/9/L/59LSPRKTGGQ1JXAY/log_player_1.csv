"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an even split, now I'll try to take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take a larger share of the money, which is unfair. I was willing to start with an even split, but now he's trying to take a 2:3 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent deal""}

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, which is still a relatively fair division. I'm giving Bob a slightly smaller share than in the initial proposal, but I'm still trying to be reasonable and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take more, I'll take a bit more myself 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. He's trying to take an even larger share of the money, and I'm starting to feel like he's not willing to compromise at all. I was willing to give him a slightly smaller share in the previous round, but now he's trying to take a 55:45 split in his favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's go back to an even split, it's a fair deal""}

I'm proposing to go back to an even split, which was the initial proposal. I think this is a fair deal, and it's a good compromise. I'm willing to give up some of my gains from previous rounds to get back to a fair split."
