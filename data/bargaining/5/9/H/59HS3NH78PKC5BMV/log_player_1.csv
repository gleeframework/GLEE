"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 60-40, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling bold, Alice! I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, I have to consider that the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. So, if I gain $20, it's equivalent to $19 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'd be getting $19, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, with me getting $40 and Bob getting $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting greedy, Alice! I think I deserve most of it 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is catching up!

Considering the inflation, the $10 I'd gain in Round 4 is equivalent to $8.63 in the first round's value.

Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll think about it. Since I'd be getting $8.63, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance, Bob. Will this work for you?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, with me getting $30 and Bob getting $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, Alice! I'll take what I can get 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the inflation, the $5 I'd gain in Round 6 is equivalent to $3.91 in the first round's value.

Bob's offer is quite one-sided, but I'll think about it. Since I'd be getting $3.91, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 7:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
