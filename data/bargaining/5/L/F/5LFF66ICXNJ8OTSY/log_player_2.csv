Let's see what I can get!  I'll make a counter-offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll take the lead and offer Alice a slightly smaller share.  Let's see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. With the inflation, the money I gain is worth much less. I'll accept the 50/50 split."
