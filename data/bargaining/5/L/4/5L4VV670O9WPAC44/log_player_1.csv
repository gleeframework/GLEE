"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
I propose to keep almost all the money for myself, giving Bob a minimal amount. I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Even though I'm getting half the money, it's a significant amount and the risk of getting nothing in the next round is too high."
