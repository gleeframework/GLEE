"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start with, Bob. Fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 400,000, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the lead on this negotiation.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, Bob. You're getting closer to your desired share, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you can do better than this. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, 550,000 is a good deal for me considering the risk of getting nothing. Let's call it a day."
