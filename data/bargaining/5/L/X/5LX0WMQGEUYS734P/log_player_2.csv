"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer!  I'll make a much fairer proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This split reflects the fact that the money is worth much less to you as time goes on.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than that to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but I think I can still get a better deal. The inflation is working heavily in my favor now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and that money is rapidly losing value for you.  Take this deal before it gets even worse!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with every passing round.  Let's split it evenly and get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is fair, and while I could push for more, there's a real risk Alice will hold out for a better deal in the later rounds. Accepting now guarantees a decent share, even with the inflation."
