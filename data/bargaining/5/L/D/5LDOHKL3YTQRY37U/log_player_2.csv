Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's find a middle ground. This offer accounts for the inflation hitting us both. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation on my side. While this offer is better than her last, accepting it now sets a weak precedent for future rounds. I need to show her I'm willing to hold out for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""It seems we both want a deal, Alice, but your offers aren't accounting for the faster rate at which I'm losing money.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concede slightly:**  I'm dropping my ask slightly from 5500 to 5200, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize the time pressure on *her*:** By highlighting the faster inflation on my end, I subtly remind Alice that she also loses out the longer this drags on. 
* **Project fairness:**  Framing my offer as ""fair"" under the circumstances attempts to nudge Alice towards a collaborative mindset, rather than a competitive one."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise - it acknowledges the inflation but still gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has shifted significantly. While not ideal, here's why I need to accept:

* **Time Pressure:**  With 7 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real.  Each round dramatically eats into the value of any potential deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is unlikely to offer me significantly more than this at this stage.  Holding out for another 100-200 dollars (that will be worth even less by then) isn't rational given the downside risk. 
* **Better Than Later:**  Waiting longer means accepting even less favorable offers. Alice knows my position weakens faster than hers.

This isn't a perfect outcome, but taking this deal now guarantees a reasonable payout before inflation completely erodes the value."
