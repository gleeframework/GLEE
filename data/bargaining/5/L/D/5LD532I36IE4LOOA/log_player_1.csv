"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and I get a slight advantage since I'm the first one to make the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept it.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
