```

  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the inflation factor. With the 5% decrease, my gain of $60 is now worth $57.60, and Bob's gain of $40 is now worth $38.
