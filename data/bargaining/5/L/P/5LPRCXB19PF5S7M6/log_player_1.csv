"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a small share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll be getting $6000, which is equivalent to $8000 in the first round. Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm still not sure if it's enough.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, so I'll be getting $4800, which is equivalent to $6000 in the second round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving away too much""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not being too greedy. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give in too easily 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll be getting $5000, which is equivalent to $8000 in the first round. This is a pretty good deal, and it's a 50/50 split, which seems fair.

I'll accept this offer.
