"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, the inflation means that I would be getting $1000 worth less than what Bob is offering.  It's better to keep playing and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself.  This is a compromise considering the inflation, but still gives me a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, the inflation means that I would be getting $2000 worth less than what Bob is offering.  It's better to keep playing and see if I can get a better deal.  The value of my gains keeps decreasing, but so does the value of his gains.  We are both playing a risky game, and I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still trying to secure a good share.  This offer is a significant decrease from my last offer, but Bob is showing a pattern of increasing his share, so I need to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to accept this, I'm still holding out. Inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, but it's also diminishing the value of the money he's offering. There's still a chance I can get a better deal if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Inflation is really taking its toll, but I'm hoping Bob will see that my share is rapidly shrinking and that a compromise is necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While the inflation has significantly decreased the value of my share, it's better to take something rather than nothing. If I reject this offer, there is no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything in the next round.  The risk of getting nothing is too high at this point.  I'll accept this offer and take what I can."
