"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a good deal next round if you reject this offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to consider the value of the money in this round. In this case, the total amount is $1,000,000, but it's worth 80% of its original value due to inflation.

Bob's offer is to give me $300,000, which is 30% of the total amount. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this is a relatively small share.

However, Bob's message is intriguing - he's hinting that if I reject this offer, he'll give me a better deal next round. I'm curious to know what that might be.

For now, I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share this round, but I still want a decent chunk myself""}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a significant amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is losing value quickly! With the 48.8% reduction, the total amount is now worth $512,000.

Bob's offer is to give me $400,000, which is 78.9% of the reduced total amount. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this is a relatively good offer from Bob.

However, I'm not sure if I should take it, as I was hoping for a better deal. But, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a smaller share in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to...
