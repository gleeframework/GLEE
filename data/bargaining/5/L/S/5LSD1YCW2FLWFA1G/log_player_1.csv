Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too favorable to you. Let's be more equitable this time.  I'm proposing a slight majority for me, considering I'll be taking on the risk of further inflation if you reject. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
