"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current offer doesn't seem fair enough, considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'll try to find a balance that might appeal to her.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the shares to make it more mutually beneficial.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation hurts us both, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both our gains, Alice's offer seems reasonable at this point. The difference in the loss of value between our shares is significant, and proceeding further might not yield a better outcome for me. Accepting this offer appears to be the most pragmatic decision under the current circumstances."
