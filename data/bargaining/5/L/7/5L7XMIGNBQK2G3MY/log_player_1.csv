"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm confident I can secure a good share, but I'm also willing to offer Bob a small amount to get the ball rolling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than the previous round, I'm still confident that I can secure a larger share. I believe the inflation rate affecting Bob will push him to offer me a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still believe I deserve the majority of the money. I'm offering Bob 15 dollars, which is more than he received in the previous round. Hopefully, this will be enough to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation is starting to affect Bob, his offer is still not appealing enough.  I believe I can secure a larger share by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. I believe that the inflation rate will continue to affect Bob, and he'll be more willing to accept a smaller share as we approach the deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With inflation hitting Bob hard, it seems like we've reached a point where a 50/50 split is the best I can get. I'll accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
