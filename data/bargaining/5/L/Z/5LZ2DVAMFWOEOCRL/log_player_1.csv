I'm going for a pretty aggressive opening offer. Since I'm risk-averse, I want to secure as much as possible early on.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'm going to reject it.  I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since I'm not losing any value from round to round.  I'll try to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a majority share.  I want to see if I can get Bob to accept before the inflation really starts to affect him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'm going to reject it. The inflation is starting to hurt Bob more, so I think I can push for a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a larger share of the pie. I think Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, and might be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would like to get more, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds. The inflation is really hitting Bob hard, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. This offer is still a good outcome for me, and it's probably the best I can realistically expect at this point."
