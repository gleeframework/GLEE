"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This is a generous offer to Bob considering the inflation. I believe it is in my best interest to start with a generous offer to ensure a quick and fair resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

Since Bob rejected my first offer, I will adjust my proposal slightly. I am offering $850,000 for myself and $150,000 for Bob.  This offer still gives Bob a considerable portion of the money while being more favorable to me than the previous round's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed amount for myself again to $800,000, while offering Bob $200,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a significant share of the money.  I believe that by continuing to make reasonable offers, we can reach an agreement before the inflation makes the money worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering $750,000 for myself and $250,000 for Bob. I'm continuing to lower my own share, and this offer reflects the significant impact of inflation. I hope Bob will realize that accepting this offer is the best option for both of us at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

With inflation continuing, I am adjusting my offer once again. I propose $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob. This offer represents a continued commitment to a fair compromise and highlights the importance of reaching a deal sooner rather than later."
