"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice.  Let's be fair - I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject and counter-propose.
* **Counter Offer:** 
    *  I'm aiming for a slightly advantageous split, understanding that the value decreases over time.
    *  By offering slightly more than Alice initially did for me, I'm hoping she'll see it as a fair deal before inflation eats into the value further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting late in the game and the value is dropping fast.  This is a final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round. Delaying further significantly hurts both of us.
* **Improved Offer:** While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, it's a noticeable improvement from her first offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 4 is very risky. The value will decrease even further, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better deal. 

It's better to accept a slightly unfavorable offer now than risk getting a much worse outcome later."
