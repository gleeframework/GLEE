9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair-ish split. I'm willing to give you 10% since I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what you think!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,My turn! How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  This seems fair considering the decreasing value and the time constraint.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to go up to 5500,  but I think we can find a better solution that's more fair for both of us.  Let's keep talking.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I'm proposing a 58/42 split.  The clock is ticking, and this offer considers the decreasing value for both of us, but especially for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it down the middle.  We both lose if we don't reach an agreement.  This way we both get something, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.",Alice,5,
