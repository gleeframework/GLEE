**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that time is running out.  Every round makes the money worth less, putting more pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Slight Concession:**  I've lowered my initial demand slightly to show some flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.
* **Finality:** By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling that I'm unlikely to budge further, pushing Bob towards a decision.

This strategy aims to make Bob think accepting now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
