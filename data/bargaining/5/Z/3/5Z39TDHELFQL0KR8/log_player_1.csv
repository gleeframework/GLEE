"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\nI'll start by proposing a division that slightly favors me but still offers Bob a significant amount, considering the value of money will decrease with each round. My message will be straightforward, highlighting the benefit of accepting early to avoid inflation loss.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Accept now to avoid inflation loss""
}
```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, but with a slight advantage for me this time.  It's better than letting the value drop further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2

Considering the offer and the impact of inflation, I will reject this proposal. The offer does not significantly improve my position, and accepting now would mean I lose the opportunity to propose a better division for myself in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Alice: Round 3

Given the decreasing value of money, my next proposal will slightly adjust the amounts to try and find a middle ground that Bob might accept, considering we both want to minimize losses from inflation. My message will emphasize the urgency of accepting an offer sooner rather than later.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,
  ""bob_gain"": 4750,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise to minimize inflation impact""
}
```
