"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 80/20, a fair starting point!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In terms of the current value, Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: 4500 (10,000 * 0.9)
* Bob gain: 5000

Considering the reduced value, I think this offer is a bit too generous for Bob, but I'm not sure if I want to reject it and risk getting even less in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
