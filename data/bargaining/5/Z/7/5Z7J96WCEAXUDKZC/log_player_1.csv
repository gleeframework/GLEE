# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair and split this evenly.  50/50, no more hassle. The clock is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

This is a good time to accept for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 8 rounds remaining and inflation working against Bob, the pressure is on him to make a decent offer.
* **Fair Offer:** While not ideal, a 50/50 split is fair. Holding out for significantly more might backfire if Bob becomes less generous in later rounds. 
* **Inflation:** Remember, even though the dollar amount is the same, the value of Bob's share is decreasing each round."
