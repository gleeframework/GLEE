"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to keep 900,000 for myself, and give Bob 100,000. This feels fair since we're both getting something, and I'm taking a slightly larger share because I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I initially offered a more favorable split, I realize that with the inflation rate and Bob's counter-offer, accepting this deal is the better choice. I'll gain 100,000, and even though it's a smaller amount, it's better than risking getting nothing at all in future rounds."
