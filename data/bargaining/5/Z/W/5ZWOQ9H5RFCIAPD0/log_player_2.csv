Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed getting serious, for you. My offer is still quite generous.

# Alice gain: 57

It's getting too risky to keep rejecting, especially with the significant inflation against me.  While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures I get something rather than potentially getting nothing."
