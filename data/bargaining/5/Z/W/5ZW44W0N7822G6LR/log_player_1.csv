"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This round offers you a much better deal than you'd get if you wait. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
