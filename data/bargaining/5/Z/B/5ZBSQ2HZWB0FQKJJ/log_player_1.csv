"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject this offer. My gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, but Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth only 90% of what it was in the first round. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the current value of the money, and Bob will get 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is an interesting offer. Since Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, I'll consider it carefully. Given the effects of inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, the fact that Bob is proposing a 50-50 split suggests he might be trying to avoid further negotiations.

I'll accept this offer.
