I propose a 900,000$ - 100,000$ split in my favor. This gives Bob a decent starting point, but leaves me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 800,000, but still offering Bob a significant amount of 200,000. This is a compromise, but with inflation starting to affect Bob more, I hope it's a deal he can accept."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm dropping my share to 700,000, but still offering Bob a decent portion at 300,000. Inflation is biting into Bob's potential gains more and more, so I hope he sees this as a good compromise before the pressure gets too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than his previous offers, inflation is making his gain increasingly less valuable. I still believe I can secure a larger share of the money, especially as inflation continues to affect Bob more than me."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm dropping my share to 600,000 and offering Bob 400,000.  At this point, inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains, and he may be more willing to accept a smaller share to secure something."
