"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a slightly larger share to give me more room to negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split it 60-40, with me getting the bigger share since I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to turn the tables on me by making the same offer I made in Round 1! 

However, I'm not going to fall for it. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more this round. Let's try again!""
}
```"
