"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

**Offer:** I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see if Bob is cooperative.  While I want the majority, I also want to avoid a long game where the value of the money decreases too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

**Offer:** Alice gets $850,000 and Bob gets $150,000.

**Reasoning:**  Bob rejected my previous offer, so it seems he wants a bigger share. I'm increasing his portion to $150,000, hoping it will be enough to secure an agreement.  I'm still prioritizing getting the majority, but I need to be careful not to lose too much due to inflation."
