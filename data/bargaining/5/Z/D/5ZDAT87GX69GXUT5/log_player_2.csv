"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the 4000 now, it's better to see if Alice will budge in the next round. Remember, with each round the money becomes less valuable, and since Bob's money is losing value faster than Alice's, it makes sense to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split, with me getting 60%, is fairer.  It reflects the fact that your money is losing value at a slower rate than mine.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While a 50/50 split would be ideal, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation and her willingness to compromise.  Taking the 4200 now is better than risking a worse deal in the next round, especially since my money is losing value faster."
