Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more""}\n\n### \n\nIn this response, I've taken into account the impact of inflation on both of our gains. Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less each round, and for Bob it's 10%, I've adjusted my offer to ensure a fairer split considering these changing values. My message to Bob reflects this reasoning, emphasizing the need for a slightly larger share due to the higher rate of inflation affecting my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We both lose value with each round, so it's better to agree now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### \n\nIn this decision, I've considered Bob's offer to split the money evenly. However, given the higher rate of inflation affecting my gain (48.8% less value compared to the first round) versus Bob's (27.1% less value), I believe accepting an even split at this point would not be advantageous. The difference in inflation impact suggests that I should aim for a higher share to compensate for the greater loss in value over time. Thus, I choose to reject the offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a more favorable split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### \n\nIn this round, I've taken into account the increasing impact of inflation on both our gains and the fact that we are getting closer to the deadline. Given the higher rate of inflation affecting my gain, I believe a slightly more favorable split is necessary. However, I also acknowledge that as rounds progress, the overall value of the money decreases for both of us, making it beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Thus, I've adjusted my offer to reflect these considerations, aiming for a balance between compensating for the higher inflation rate and the urgency to agree.\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation and the need to agree soon, I propose this split.""}"
