Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more realistic. I'm willing to split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share. It's still a good deal, considering we're losing 20% every round. We can either agree now, or keep risking it all. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
