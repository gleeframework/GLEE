Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a fair 50/50 split considering the time pressure and the diminishing value of the money.  Take the deal before it's too late for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
