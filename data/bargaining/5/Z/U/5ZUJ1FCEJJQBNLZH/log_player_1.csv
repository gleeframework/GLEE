"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good one, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round (95% of 95%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
