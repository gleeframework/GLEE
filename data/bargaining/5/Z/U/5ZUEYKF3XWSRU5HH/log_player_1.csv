Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's be fair, but also try to get a little more for ourselves. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep moving towards a fair split. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to be happy with the outcome. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to wear me down with slight concessions each round, knowing the value of the pot is decreasing significantly for me.  I need to hold out for a better deal or the time pressure will force me to accept a bad one."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 5200,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your frustration, but we need to find a deal that works for both of us. This offer is a step towards a compromise, let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still trying to inch his way to a win. While the difference is getting smaller, I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  The loss from inflation is becoming significant, but I'm hoping he'll break before I have to accept a deal worse than my original offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to draw a line in the sand.  Bob is clearly hoping I'll panic as the deadline approaches. Offering a 50/50 split removes any argument of fairness and puts the pressure squarely on him.  If he rejects this, he's gambling on me caving in later, which would mean accepting a worse deal than he's already been offered."
