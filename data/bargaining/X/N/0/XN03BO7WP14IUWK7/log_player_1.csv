"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering we both have to deal with the inflation now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is actually worth $4,375 ($4,500 x 0.975, since 5% less than $4,600, the value of $4,500 in the first round).

Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth $5,225 ($5,500 x 0.942, since 10% less than $5,833, the value of $5,500 in the first round).

I'm not sure if 55-45 is fair, considering the inflation affects me more severely than Bob. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,500 in the previous round is worth $4,375. To adjust for the inflation, I'll propose a slightly higher amount this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on 48-52, let's move forward""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, with me getting $4,800 and Bob getting $5,200."
