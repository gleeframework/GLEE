"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, given that the money is worth less with each round. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
