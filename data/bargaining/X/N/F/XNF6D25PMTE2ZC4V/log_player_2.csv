**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is working in my favor.  The longer the game goes on, the less value the money has for Alice, making her more likely to accept a deal where I get the majority. I'm willing to push my luck a bit further to try and secure a better outcome."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6200,
""alice_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Time is money Alice, and we're both losing it! This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** The ""final offer"" tactic can sometimes push the other party to accept, especially when time is a factor.
* **Slight Concession:** The offer is a slight concession from my previous offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate, but not by much.
* **Time Advantage:** The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice might become, potentially leading her to accept a less favorable offer in later rounds."
