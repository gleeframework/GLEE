"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in favor of myself.  This seems like a reasonable starting point, considering I have the advantage of knowing how inflation affects me, and I want to ensure a good outcome.  However, I'm leaving Bob with a small share to incentivize him to accept the offer rather than risk getting less in the future."
