"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me the larger share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $50 is worth less than before, but Bob's share of $50 is still the same as before. I'll accept this offer to get a guaranteed share of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation.
