"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This offer gives me a 60% share, which seems like a good starting point considering the inflation factor favors me in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair split, and with inflation, the value of the money is decreasing.  It's better to accept now rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
