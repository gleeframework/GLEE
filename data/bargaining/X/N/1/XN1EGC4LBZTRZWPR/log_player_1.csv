"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll. My offer was rejected, and now Bob is offering a 50/50 split. I'll think carefully about this...

I'll accept this offer.
