"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 20% reduction in the value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. With the 27.1% reduction in the value of the money I gain, I need to be even more cautious. Bob's offer is now more reasonable, and I think it's a good opportunity to accept.
