"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, leaving a good portion for Bob while securing most of the money for myself.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better than the 20% inflated value of my previous offer, but I'm not satisfied. I believe I can still get a better deal.  We have plenty of rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 7000 for me, 3000 for Bob.  This should be a good compromise, especially considering the 20% inflation since my last proposal. Let's see if he's willing to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is significantly less than my initial offer, but considering the inflation, it's still a decent chunk of the remaining value. A 50/50 split is fair in this situation, and I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing at all."
