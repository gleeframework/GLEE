"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to give you a bit more since you'll be taking a bigger hit on inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Even with the inflation, I think I can get more than 40."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the last round, but I think we can do better.  I'm willing to give you 40, but I need the remaining 60 to make it worth my while with the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a bit more than 40.  Let's split it 55/45.  It's a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm willing to accept this offer, as the inflation is starting to take a bigger bite out of my gains.  A 45/55 split is a good compromise."
