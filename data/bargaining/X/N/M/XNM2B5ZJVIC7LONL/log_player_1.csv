Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share given the risk of inflation. This offer is a good starting point, but I'd like to get closer to 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
