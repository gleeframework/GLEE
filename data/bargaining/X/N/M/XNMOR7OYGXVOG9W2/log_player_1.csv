"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. It's a 60-40 split, which is a pretty good deal for both of us, considering we're just starting out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'd be getting 360,000$ (600,000 - 10% of 600,000) and Bob would be getting 540,000$ (400,000 - 10% of 400,000).

I'm not happy with this deal. I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. It's a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the reduced value of the money."
