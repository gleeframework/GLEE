Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 610000

This is a tough situation, but I need to stop the bleeding.  Each round is costing me significantly more due to inflation. While I'd prefer a more even split, taking $390,000 now is better than risking even less in future rounds."
