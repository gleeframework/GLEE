"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20$ and keeping 80$ for myself. This is a fair starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest solution! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get more in this round. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get more, let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased worth of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""This is a good compromise, let's settle on this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40$ and keeping 60$ for myself, hoping this will be a more acceptable offer for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too. Let's reach a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in the value of money due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. However, Bob's offer of 40$ for me is still relatively low considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, let's keep negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45$ and keeping 55$ for myself, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
