Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to weigh the benefits.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
