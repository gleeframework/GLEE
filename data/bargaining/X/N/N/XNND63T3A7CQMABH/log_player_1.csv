It's painful, but I have to accept.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Severe Inflation:** At this stage, the inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. Waiting any longer will likely result in even worse offers from Bob.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is clearly employing a waiting game, knowing my position weakens each round. He's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting a reduced share is better than dragging this out and potentially ending up with an even smaller amount, or even nothing."
