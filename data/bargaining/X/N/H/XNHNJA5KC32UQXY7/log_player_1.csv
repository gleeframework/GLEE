Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This reflects the value of our time, as I'm taking the risk of rejection and facing inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
