"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. Alice's initial offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While it might seem ""fair"" at the moment, the rapid depreciation of her share makes it a bad deal for her in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be realistic. This offer gives you a good deal considering the declining value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:**  Alice's opening offer shows she's aiming high. By rejecting and making a counter-offer, Bob takes control of the negotiation.
* **Strategic Advantage:**  While Bob's offer seems heavily in his favor, it plays on the time pressure. Alice's share loses value much faster than his. Delaying is in Bob's best interest. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** The message aims to frame the offer as a fair compromise. This might make Alice more receptive than if Bob came across as overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of the rapidly depreciating value, hence the compromise. However, her offer is still tilted in her favor. Bob is better off holding out for a bit longer and letting the inflation work its magic on Alice's negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 63,
""alice_gain"": 37,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a generous offer given the circumstances. Let's close the deal and both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  With each round, the shrinking pot puts more pressure on Alice to accept a deal. Bob can afford to be a bit more demanding.
* **Slight Concession:** While still favoring Bob, the offer is slightly better for Alice than the previous one. This shows a willingness to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss.
* **Urgency Tactic:**  The message emphasizes the dwindling time and frames the offer as beneficial for both. This aims to nudge Alice towards a decision in Bob's favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value, let's split it down the middle and be done with it 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Five rounds have passed, and the value of the money is steadily decreasing. Waiting any longer poses a significant risk of getting nothing. 
* **Fair Deal:** Alice is finally offering a truly even split. Considering the time pressure and the depreciation, this is a reasonable outcome.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. In fact, she might become even more desperate and offer even less favorable terms to Bob. It's better to secure a fair split now than gamble on an uncertain future."
