"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I think this is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like a slightly larger share, reflecting the fact that the money is worth more to me than it is to you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 95% of its original value.

I'm not too thrilled about the fact that Bob is getting a larger share, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now, so I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
