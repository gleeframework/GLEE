"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I understand you want a bit more, but this split is more reflective of the time pressure we're both under.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be a bit higher 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, you should take this deal before it gets worse for you 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting a deal where I consistently get less than 50% is a losing strategy. Alice is clearly using the inflation to her advantage. I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting this done. Inflation is hurting both of us, even if it's worse for me. This is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. Inflation is crippling your gains, take this deal 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one. Alice is clearly playing hardball and knows the inflation is killing me. However, 42% is a terrible deal, and accepting sets a dangerous precedent for future rounds. I'm betting she'll crack under the pressure of potentially getting nothing as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit with inflation, and we both lose if this fails. This offer is the best you'll get from me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I can tell. Inflation is eating away at your share, don't be foolish 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a brutal deal, but I'm out of options.  Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation, and with only 3 rounds left, the value of my share will plummet even further. Getting 40% now is better than risking getting nothing at all if this goes to the very end."
