"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 7-3 split, it's a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $270,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is now worth $630,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's a compromise. I'll accept it.
