"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing. With each round, the inflation is making the money worth less, and I don't want to gamble with that."
