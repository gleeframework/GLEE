"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a proposal that is heavily in my favor. I figure that Bob might accept it, but if he doesn't, I can adjust my offer in the next round.  The key is to start strong and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept a measly $10, especially since my gains are worth 20% less now. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more reasonable, but still in my favor. Bob's offer was outrageous, and I'm hoping he realizes that we need to reach a compromise.  This offer is more balanced, acknowledging that we both need to gain something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too greedy. My gains are worth almost half what they were in the first round, and he's offering me a pittance. I'm not going to give in to his demands. I'll continue to make my own offers in the hopes of finding a fair compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but I'm not giving up. This offer is a significant compromise, and I hope Bob recognizes the urgency of reaching a deal.  I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I won't accept anything less than 40%."
