""message"": ""Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, I think a 55/45 split is more in line with the fact that the money loses value for both of us as time passes.  I am open to further negotiation, but let's not let this drag on too long.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I think a 50/50 split is fair, given the time pressure and how the value of the money is decreasing.  This way, we both get something substantial, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
