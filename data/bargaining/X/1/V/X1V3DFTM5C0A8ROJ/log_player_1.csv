"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking most of the money this time, but I'm willing to give you a small share to avoid the risk of inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
