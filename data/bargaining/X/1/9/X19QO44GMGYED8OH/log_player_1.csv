"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair share, but I'm willing to negotiate for more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $4,750.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting an equal share, especially since he's not offering any explanation for his proposal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```

Bob's offer is a slight increase from his previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough considering the decreased value of the money. I'll think about it for a moment...
