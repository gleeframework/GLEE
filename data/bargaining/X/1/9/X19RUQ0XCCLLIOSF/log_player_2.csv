Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. I'm proposing 56/44. It's a strong offer considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a good deal for me and I'm concerned about losing more money to inflation. I accept."
