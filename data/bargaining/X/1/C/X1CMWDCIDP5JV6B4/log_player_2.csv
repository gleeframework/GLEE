Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the negotiation, but let's be realistic.  This money is losing value fast.  5800 for me and 4200 for you is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value quickly. Waiting any longer significantly diminishes the overall return for both of us.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if Bob manages to secure a slightly better deal in a future round, the gains would likely be offset by the inflation losses.  
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice's offer has decreased, indicating she is also feeling the pressure of inflation. It's unlikely she'll concede much more. 

Accepting the 4200 is the safest option, preventing further losses due to inflation.
