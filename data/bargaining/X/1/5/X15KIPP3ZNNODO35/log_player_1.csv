I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick win. 900,000 for me, 100,000 for Bob. I'll see if he accepts, but I'm ready to negotiate in the next round if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  While I can't be certain about the details of the inflation impact on Bob, I know that the money is worth less for me, and I'm not going to accept a drastically lower amount.  I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 700,000, but still offering Bob a significant share of the money.  This is a more balanced split than his last offer, and I'm hoping to reach a compromise before the effects of inflation become too drastic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the effects of inflation have been substantial, a 50/50 split is the best I can reasonably expect at this point.  I've lost a significant amount of potential earnings, but it's better to secure something rather than risk getting nothing at all.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
