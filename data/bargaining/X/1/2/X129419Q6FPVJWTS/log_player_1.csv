"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my perception of the offer.

In the first round, I was offered $6,000, which was worth $6,000. In the second round, the same amount would be worth $5,700 (95% of $6,000).

Bob's offer in the second round is $5,000 for me, which is actually a better deal than my initial offer in the first round, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
