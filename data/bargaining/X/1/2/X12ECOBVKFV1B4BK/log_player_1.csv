"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, my 4000$ in this round is worth less than my 5000$ in the first round. However, I still think I'm getting a decent deal.

I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good enough deal, especially considering Bob's gain is still higher than mine. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation effect, my offer needs to take into account that my gain will be worth even less than in the previous round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be careful with my decision. However, I think I can do better than this offer.

I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good enough deal, and I think I can negotiate for a better split. I'll wait for another offer!"
