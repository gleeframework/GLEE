Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly. I'm willing to give you $40 this round, but I'm not sure I'll be so generous in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
