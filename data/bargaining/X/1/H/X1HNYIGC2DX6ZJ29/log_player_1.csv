"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and equal split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 45%."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer. The message is a gentle nudge to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'm giving you a good chunk, but I need more to make it worthwhile for me. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's final offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can get a better deal. 40% is still a bit too low for me, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd rather try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging on the 55% mark. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm sticking to my guns and proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer. The message is a firm but polite way of saying that I'm not willing to compromise further."
