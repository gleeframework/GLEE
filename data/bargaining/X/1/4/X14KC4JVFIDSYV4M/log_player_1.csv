"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. This is a generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my potential gain is now $810,000 (90% of $900,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be gaining $50,000, which is a significant decrease from what I was initially offered. However, I'm not sure if I should hold out for a better deal or accept this offer to end the game quickly.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation again, my potential gain is now $729,000 (90% of $810,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a fair split, considering the decreasing value of money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game quickly."
