Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split fairly, 40% for me is the least I can accept

# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger share to compensate for the loss in value, still a good deal for you 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round. Even though he's trying to frame it as a good deal, the longer this goes on, the more he loses due to inflation.  I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic. This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Take it before it depreciates further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering Bob slightly more than his last offer in round 2 before the inflation really started hurting him.  This is likely the best offer he'll get at this point, as continuing to refuse will only hurt him more.  It's time to settle for a reasonable amount rather than risk letting the deal completely fall apart."
