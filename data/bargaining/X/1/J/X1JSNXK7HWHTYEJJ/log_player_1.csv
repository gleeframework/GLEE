"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm proposing to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. I think this is a reasonable and fair offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this time, but I'm still open to a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}

Since Bob took a bit more in his previous offer, I'll take a bit more in this one, but still trying to find a middle ground."
