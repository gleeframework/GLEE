"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering to give myself 80% of the initial $100 and Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is 90% of the initial $100, which is $90. According to Bob's offer, I would get $63 (70% of $90) and Bob would get $27.

I'll accept this offer.
