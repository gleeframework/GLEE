Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm feeling the inflation pinch already, how about we meet a bit closer to the middle this time? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation is affecting you, but my initial offer still stands as fair.  I'm willing to be patient, but I won't settle for less.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real, we both lose if this drags on. 50/50 is the only fair split at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Time is Money:** While Bob is feeling the inflation pinch, I'm losing potential gains with each round that doesn't end in my favor.  
* **Future Leverage:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure. He went from 45 to a 50/50 split in just one round. This shows my position has merit.
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm willing to push for another round or two. Bob's offer will likely continue to trend in my favor as the game progresses."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down slightly to 58/42. This reflects the increasing pressure of inflation on both of us.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm moving slightly from my initial offer to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Advantage:** The offer still heavily favors me, taking advantage of Bob's increasing inflation disadvantage. 
* **Time Pressure:** As we approach the halfway point, the pressure is on Bob to settle before his potential gains diminish further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking.  I appreciate the movement in your last offer, but it wasn't enough.  I'm proposing 52/48. This accounts for the inflation impact while acknowledging your initial advantage. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob has cleverly flipped the script and now has the larger share. Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Position:** He knows I'm aiming for a better deal than 50/50.  He's betting I'll be desperate to avoid getting even less as time runs out.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject, there's a chance I could get a better offer in the next rounds, but also a chance I could end up with less than 48. 

Despite the risk, I'll stick to my guns and aim higher.

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer acknowledges the impact of inflation, meaning he understands its significance. I'm betting he's bluffing and will be even more desperate to settle in the coming rounds as his potential earnings shrink.  I need to hold my ground to maximize my gains."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a critical juncture.  I'm proposing 55/45. This offer balances the need for a fair resolution with the ever-increasing impact of inflation.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm holding my ground above 50/50 but conceding slightly from my last offer to signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Urgency:** The message stresses the need for a swift resolution, reminding Bob that time is working against him.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer potentially represents the sweet spot where I maximize my gains without completely alienating Bob and risking a complete breakdown of negotiations."
