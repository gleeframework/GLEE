"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial 100$, which is 60 dollars, and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split and end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 50% 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll have to weigh the benefits of ending the game now versus the potential for a better offer in the next round.
