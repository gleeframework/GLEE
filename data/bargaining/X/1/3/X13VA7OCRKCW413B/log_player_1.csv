{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 45-55 is a good starting point for me. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
