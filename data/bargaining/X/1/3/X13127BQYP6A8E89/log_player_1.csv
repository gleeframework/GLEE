"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000. My message to Bob is that it's a fair start, implying that this is a reasonable and balanced proposal."
