"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with something to hopefully get him to accept.  Since I don't know how the inflation affects him, I'm taking a bit of a gamble here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is affecting my potential gains significantly.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the safest option at this point."
