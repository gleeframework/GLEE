"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is a bit more generous than my first one, but I still think I can do better. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This time, I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
