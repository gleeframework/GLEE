"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather not accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the previous round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn now. I'll make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not giving away too much. What's your next move?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant portion for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money Bob gains is now worth significantly less than what I initially proposed.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not comfortable with a 35/65 split, especially since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the previous rounds.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn now. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a good deal for myself.""
}
