Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fairer split, but 60/40 is still too far in your favor.  I propose a 70/30 split as a compromise. Let's move towards an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more balanced split, accepting 30% at this stage would be a significant loss, especially considering the rapid inflation. It's worth risking another round to see if we can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and losing money with every round. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.  Let's be rational and take the win-win.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, and the inflation is rapidly eating into the potential gains. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** A 50/50 split is the most objectively fair division, and emphasizing this fairness might make Alice more receptive. 
* **Urgency:**  The ""let's be rational"" and ""win-win"" framing stresses the need for a quick and mutually beneficial agreement."
