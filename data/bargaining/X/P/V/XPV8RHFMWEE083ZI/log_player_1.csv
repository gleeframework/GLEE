"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose taking $90, leaving $10 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the money depreciates for him faster than for me.  Let's see what he thinks!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
