"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'll be the one making the offer in the next round if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since Bob is offering a 60-40 split, which is closer to my original proposal, I'm tempted to accept. However, I'm also concerned that if I accept, Bob might get an even better deal in the next round.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for Bob than my original offer, but still closer to the original 60-40 split."
