"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair split, Bob. Let's start things off right! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While starting off ""fair"" sounds nice, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Bob should hold out for a much better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This split recognizes that time is money - especially for you.""
}
``` 

This offer is designed to be strong but also acknowledge the game's dynamics:

* **Favorable to Bob:**  60/40 heavily favors Bob, but that's the point.  Early rounds are Bob's leverage.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message subtly reminds Alice her share decreases faster. Bob is willing to negotiate, but this starts the anchor high.
* **Not Insulting:**  While firm, it avoids language that would make Alice dig in her heels out of spite. A deal needs to be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a more balanced split this time, Bob. We both need to come to an agreement that works for us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, and her offer reflects that.  While closer to reasonable, it's still unacceptable for Bob given the rapid inflation working against him. A 60/40 split in Alice's favor is only acceptable in the very late stages of the game, if at all.  Bob needs to hold firm and push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking away. This offer is fair and gives us both a decent share before inflation eats away at it too much.""
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense for Round 4:

* **Concession:** Bob comes down slightly from 60/40, showing willingness to negotiate, but only slightly.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking pie, putting pressure on Alice without being aggressive.
* **""Fairness"":**  Framing it as ""fair"" is strategic. It's subjective, but Bob needs to plant that seed as rounds progress.
* **Anticipating Future:** This offer, if accepted now, is likely better than what Bob could get in Rounds 6-7+ due to inflation. He's aiming for a deal *this* round, ideally."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This is a fair split, considering the inflation we've both been dealing with. It's time to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is it, the tipping point.  Here's why Bob should take the 50/50 split:

* **Inflation:**  While not ideal, 18.55% loss for Bob stings less than the HUGE 59.04% Alice is taking.  The deal favors Bob *relative to future rounds*.
* **Alice is Hurting:** Her message screams desperation.  She KNOWS the longer this goes, the worse it is for her.  This is likely the best she'll offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for 55/45 or better is HIGHLY unlikely.  Alice knows Bob is feeling the pressure too.  Greed could lead to 0 for both players.

50/50 NOW is better than the risk of a worse deal, or even NO DEAL, in later rounds.  Take the money and run!"
