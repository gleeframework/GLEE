"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... and decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, but I'll have to think carefully about the next round's inflation..."
