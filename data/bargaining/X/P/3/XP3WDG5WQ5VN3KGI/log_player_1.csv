"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that you get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This is a good starting point, as it is fair and leaves plenty of room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $800,000 for me and $200,000 for him. Since the money is worth less with each round, it's important to keep making progress towards a fair split. This offer reflects that while still being significantly more favorable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than his last offer, it's still significantly unfair, and I'm not willing to accept a deal where I receive only 20% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground.  I'll offer $700,000 for me and $300,000 for Bob. This offer reflects the increasing inflation while still being a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is closer to being fair than previous ones, the inflation rate is getting increasingly significant. I'm not going to accept a deal where I receive only 30% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Bob. Inflation is making the money worth less with each passing round, and we need to reach an agreement quickly. I believe this offer reflects that reality while still being fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is getting closer to being fair, but it's still not a good deal for me. It's important to remember that the money is worth much less now than it was at the beginning, and I'm not willing to accept an offer where I receive only 40% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Inflation is taking its toll on both of us, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement quickly. A 50/50 split is fair and reflects the diminishing value of money."
