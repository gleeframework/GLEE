"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference to see how you'll react.""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, will take 90 dollars and Bob will take 10 dollars. The message is a playful way to break the ice and see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, my gain of 45 is actually 9 dollars less than I would have gotten in the first round.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think an even split is a bit too uneven for me, considering I'm the one who made the first offer and Bob got to respond. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more after being the first to propose.""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, will take 60 dollars and Bob will take 40 dollars. The message is a gentle way to convey that I'm still trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
