"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly higher share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 4000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
