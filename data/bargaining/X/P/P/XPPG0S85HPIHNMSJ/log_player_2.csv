"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Please let me know when it's my turn to propose a division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to propose a division of the money. Here is my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's try a different split. This way, we both still get a good amount, but I get a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about this offer, considering the impact of inflation. Since the money is now worth 36% less than in the first round, and this is Alice's final offer, I'll weigh my options carefully.
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer. Given the decreasing value of the money and Alice's assertion that this is her final offer, I believe accepting 45, even though it's worth less than initially, is the best choice to ensure I receive some amount rather than risking further devaluation or the possibility of getting nothing if the game were to continue indefinitely."
