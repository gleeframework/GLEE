"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for round 1.  I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than you'll get if you wait another round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
