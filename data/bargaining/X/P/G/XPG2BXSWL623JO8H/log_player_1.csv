"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, it's a good starting point, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now considering Bob's offer. I'm not thrilled about accepting 400k, but it's better than going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
