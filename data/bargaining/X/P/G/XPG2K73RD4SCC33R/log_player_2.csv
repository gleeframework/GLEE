**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my shrinking pot. While her offers are getting progressively worse for me, I still have some leverage.  It's time to show I'm serious about not getting pushed around by the inflation game.  A complete rejection might encourage her to make a more reasonable offer next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. I propose a 50/50 split. Take it or let's both lose out because of this pointless game.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a strong signal. Alice needs to understand that her tactics are transparent and pushing me towards a scenario where we both lose.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, and it puts the ball firmly in her court. If she's rational, she'll recognize this as a good opportunity to end the game with a substantial gain."
