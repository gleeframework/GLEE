"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value each round, I need to be more cautious. Bob's proposal for an even split seems reasonable, but I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money losing value rapidly, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Accept this offer and we can still walk away with something.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but we need to reach an agreement soon. This offer is closer to your previous proposal and still provides a good share for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly, and Bob's compromise is getting more appealing. I'll consider this offer carefully.
