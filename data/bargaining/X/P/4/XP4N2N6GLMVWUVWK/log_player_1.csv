"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I propose to take 60$ and Bob takes 40$. This feels like a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share while still leaving me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer gives him a much larger share, rejecting it ensures that I get to make the next proposal. This gives me the chance to negotiate a more favorable outcome for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to propose. I propose a 50/50 split. This feels like a fair compromise, especially with inflation factoring in. I believe Bob will find this a more reasonable offer compared to his last one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, I choose to reject this offer. While it's a small gain for me, rejecting allows me to make the proposal in the next round. This gives me the best chance to secure a more favorable deal. The longer we play, the less money there is to divide, but I still have a chance to get a better deal by controlling the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

With inflation continuing to reduce the value of the money, I propose a slight shift towards Bob's favor. Offering 40 for myself and 60 for Bob might seem like a generous offer, but it's actually a strategic move. I believe this offer is more likely to be accepted by Bob than my previous ones, as he's consistently proposed taking the larger share.  This gives me the best chance to finally get the game finished and secure some money, albeit significantly less than in the initial rounds."
