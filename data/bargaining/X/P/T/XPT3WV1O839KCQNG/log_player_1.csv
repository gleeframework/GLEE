"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a chance on a bigger share for me! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the value of my share. However, I do think 20 dollars is a bit low.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A slightly more generous offer, hope you'll accept this time""}

I'm increasing the share for Bob by 5 dollars, hoping that he'll find this offer more appealing. I'm still trying to maintain a balanced split, but giving him a slightly bigger share to make the game more interesting."
