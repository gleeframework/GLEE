"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a bit too far in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split that takes into account the inflation, but is still fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
