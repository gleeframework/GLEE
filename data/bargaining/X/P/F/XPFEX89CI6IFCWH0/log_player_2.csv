"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While it might seem like a decent amount now, the longer the game goes on, the less valuable her offers will become due to the inflation working against her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more evenly this time. This offer is better for you than waiting.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** My offer is closer to a 50/50 split, reflecting a fairer division of the money.
* **Inflation:**  Alice loses 20% of her potential gain with each round. By offering her 45 now, she's getting a better deal than if we go another round and she potentially receives an even lower offer. 
* **Strategic Advantage:** By taking a slightly stronger stance in this round, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept an unfair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than half 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** While Alice is conceding slightly, the offer is still heavily in her favor. 
* **Inflation Advantage:** The inflation is working significantly in my favor now.  Alice is feeling the pressure to make a deal as her potential gains decrease with each round.
* **Holding Strong:** By continuing to reject these unbalanced offers, I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to wait for a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value of your potential gains is dropping fast. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the Tables:** I'm now offering Alice the same amount she initially offered me, but with the added pressure of inflation working against her. 
* **Asserting Dominance:**  By taking a more dominant stance in the negotiation, I'm highlighting the disadvantage Alice is facing due to the decreasing value of her potential gains.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  Even though I'm in a stronger position, I'm still aiming for a solution that could be perceived as fair, leaving Alice with a reasonable portion. This might make her more likely to accept."
