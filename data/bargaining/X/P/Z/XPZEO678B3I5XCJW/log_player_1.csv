I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer, giving myself 90% and Bob 10%.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While I appreciate Bob's generosity in offering me a larger share, it's still not a fair deal.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

This time I'm proposing a more balanced split. I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a fair share of the money."
