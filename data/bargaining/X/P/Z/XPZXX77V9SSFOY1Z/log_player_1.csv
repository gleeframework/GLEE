"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's counteroffer is quite aggressive, aiming to take 90% of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3, hoping to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. Since Bob's offer was 90% of the remaining amount, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob. This offer is more balanced, but I'm still willing to negotiate.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  This is the fairest option, considering the inflation we are both facing.  
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable proposal considering the current circumstances. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can finalize the deal."
