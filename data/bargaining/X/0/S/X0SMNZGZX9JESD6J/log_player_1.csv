Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 55/45 split is fairer considering the inflation we both face. It's a better deal for you than a 50/50 split would be after the next round. Let's agree and avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
