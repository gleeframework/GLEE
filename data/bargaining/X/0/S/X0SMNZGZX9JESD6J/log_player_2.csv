""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I think a 55/45 split is fairer considering the inflation we both face. It's a better deal for you than a 50/50 split would be after the next round. Let's agree and avoid the risk of further inflation.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer.  I understand the inflation pressures on you, so I'm willing to take a smaller cut than my previous offer. Accepting now is better for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
