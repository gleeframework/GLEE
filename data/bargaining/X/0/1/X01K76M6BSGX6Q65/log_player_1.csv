"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more since the value doesn't decrease for me, but I'm still being generous considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is closer to a ""fair"" split considering the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where I'm losing a significant portion of the potential gain, especially with 10 rounds remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I'm losing money every round, so we need to settle this quickly. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your urgency, but I'm not feeling the same pressure. I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the value remains the same for me. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This offer is getting worse for me! Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While I need to make a deal soon, accepting such an unbalanced offer would set a terrible precedent for future rounds. I'm hoping a firm rejection will encourage him to negotiate more fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm compromising significantly here. Let's end this now before the inflation eats away at the value even more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to show Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement but won't accept a terrible deal. This offer is still tilted in his favor, acknowledging that his money retains its value, but it's a much smaller concession from my initial proposal. The strong message emphasizes the urgency and aims to push him towards a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see you're feeling the pressure, but I'm still in a comfortable position. I'll take a bit more, and you can still walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is unacceptable! Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation, and his offer is getting worse, not better. Accepting this would be a huge loss for me. I need to hold my ground and hope he starts taking the deadline seriously soon.  I'm willing to risk a lower offer in the next few rounds to make him realize I'm not backing down."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""bob_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. I'm compromising significantly, but I won't be taken advantage of. We're running out of time, and I'd rather get something than nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time for a bold move. I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round, signaling a willingness to compromise, but making it clear this is my absolute limit. By framing it as a final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He needs to realize that his stubbornness could cost him everything if we don't reach a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll still take a deal that gives you something rather than walking away with nothing. I'm willing to take a bigger share, considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is agonizing, but I have to accept. Bob is calling my bluff, and he's likely right. With the rounds slipping by and the value decreasing, getting something is better than nothing at this point. While his offer is far from fair, the alternative is risking a complete loss if we fail to reach an agreement."
