"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Time is money! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer is incredibly lopsided. While the offer is tempting at first glance, it's important to consider the future rounds. If I reject this offer, I get to make the proposal in the next round, and the money will be worth less to Alice.  It's worth taking the gamble."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a fair deal, Alice.  Think about what happens in the next round... ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be practical. This is hurting me more than it's hurting you. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a very unfair deal. Even with the inflation factor,  it's still worth it for me to reject and make the proposal in the next round.  The money will be worth less for Alice, and I can potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but the inflation is working in my favor now. Let's reach a compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this stalemate benefits neither of us.  I'm taking another hit from inflation. Let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep playing and potentially get a better deal,  the inflation is starting to affect me negatively, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure more than I am. This offer is a good compromise, and it's time to end this game before things get worse for both of us."
