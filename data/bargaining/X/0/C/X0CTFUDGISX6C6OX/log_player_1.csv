Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I don't think a 50/50 split is the best option for me, especially since I'm already starting with less value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for more.

  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a good deal. Will you consider this?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and giving Bob a reasonable offer to increase the chances of him accepting."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I still want a significant portion of the money. Consider this offer! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

I'm not thrilled about the idea of accepting an offer where I get $250,000, especially since it's worth even less than before. I'd like to try to negotiate for more.

However, I also don't want to risk rejecting another offer and losing the chance to get some money. I'll take a calculated risk and try to do better.

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want a decent share. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on the money's value!

I'm not thrilled about the idea of accepting an offer where I get $200,000, but I need to consider the fact that the money is worth even less now. I'm getting close to the end of the game, and I don't want to risk losing everything.

I'll take a chance and accept this offer, hoping that I can salvage something from the game.
