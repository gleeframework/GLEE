"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the remaining 1,000,000$ in a more equitable way""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial 1,000,000$, and Bob gets 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to a more interesting part of the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to overthink it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain accordingly:

My gain would be 500000 / 0.8 = 625000

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather negotiate further, 50/50 is a bit too even for me""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 40% less now (80% of 80% = 64% of the original amount). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to keep some for myself""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate my gain with the new inflation rate:

My gain would be 450000 / 0.5208 = 865769.23

I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair compromise, let's finalize the deal""
}
```"
