Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Even with the inflation, a 50/50 split is a good deal for me."
