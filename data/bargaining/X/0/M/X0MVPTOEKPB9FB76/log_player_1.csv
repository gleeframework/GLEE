Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a highly lopsided deal.  While it seems unfair,  I'm banking on Bob being unsure of the inflation dynamics and accepting this offer to avoid potential losses.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is reasonable, and the inflation makes it riskier to hold out for a better offer. Accepting ensures I get something and avoids the chance of getting nothing in later rounds."
