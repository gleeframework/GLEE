Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're not grasping the severity of the inflation hitting you.  This is my final offer - a perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it, but every round that passes hurts you far more than it hurts me. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's painful, but Alice is right.  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking an even smaller share in future rounds."
