"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fairer split. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but I need a decent cut too. This offer reflects the time pressure we both face with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise, given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting."
