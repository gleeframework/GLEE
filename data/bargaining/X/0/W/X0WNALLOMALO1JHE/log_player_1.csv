"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll adjust my thinking accordingly. 

I don't think splitting the money evenly is the best option for me, especially since I'm not sure about the inflation rate affecting Bob's perception of the money's value. I'd rather try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and I rejected the even split, I'll try to negotiate for a higher amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
