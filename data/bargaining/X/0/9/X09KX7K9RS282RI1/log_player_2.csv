"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive devaluation. I propose a 52.5% / 47.5% split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 52.5/47.5 split seems fair on the surface, remember that the money is devaluing for you with each passing round. It's better to try and negotiate a better deal for yourself, especially since you're the one who will be making the proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand your desire for a larger share, but I believe a 55/45 split is more equitable given the potential for future devaluation.  Let's reach an agreement and avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  Another round means more losses for you. I'm proposing a 51/49 split. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The money is devaluing quickly for me, and another round will mean a significant loss. This split is reasonable, and accepting it avoids further risk of devaluation."
