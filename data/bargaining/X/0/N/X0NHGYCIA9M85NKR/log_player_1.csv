"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. In this round, the effective gain for me would be 50 * 0.8 = 40. 

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 20% inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value. To account for this, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less each round. In this round, the effective gain for me would be 40 * 0.516 (100 * 0.8 * 0.64) = 20.64. 

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
