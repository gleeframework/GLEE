"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is getting less valuable by the round. I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject this offer since it's not significantly better than the first one, and I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal you think you are. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to maximize my gain, but I'm still leaving a small amount for Bob to make it seem like a decent offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. It's getting late, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the money, and Bob's offer is getting less and less valuable. I'll think carefully about this one.

I'll accept this offer, since it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, and the money is getting less valuable by the round.
