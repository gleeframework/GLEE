"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 800,000 dollars and leave 200,000 dollars for Bob. It's a pretty generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to weigh the value of the money I'll get against the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a more balanced split, with 60% of the money going to me and 40% going to Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rate, Bob's offer is looking less appealing. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make another proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal!"
