"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer is a bit aggressive but given the inflation, I want to secure the maximum amount possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action given the inflation and the fact that Bob will be making the next proposal if I reject.  500,000 is still a significant amount and it's better than risking getting less in the following rounds."
