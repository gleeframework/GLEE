I'm offering a 9000/1000 split in my favor, Bob.  Let's see if you think that's fair!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6400, ""bob_gain"": 3600}
```

This time, I'm offering a 6400/3600 split.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I'm trying to secure a larger portion for myself while still offering a fair deal to Bob.  Let's see if he accepts."
