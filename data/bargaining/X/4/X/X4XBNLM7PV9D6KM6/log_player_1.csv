"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a slight advantage 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'll be gaining $450,000, which is worth 95% of the original $500,000, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential for a better deal in future rounds.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 90% of the original $1,000,000 (95% * 95% = 90.25%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm still trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I still want a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 4, the money I gain is worth 86.74% of the original $1,000,000 (100% - 14.26% = 85.74%). I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the offer is very similar to the previous one, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the future, I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
