"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward approach. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I'd rather not risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
