"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob 10% of the money, hoping he'll accept it. I figure he'll take it since he's losing 10% of his value each round, while I'm only losing 5%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still far less than what I was initially hoping for.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if we continue to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money. I'm willing to give him more this round to incentivize him to accept. After inflation, his gain will be about 360,000, which is a decent amount.  I think this offer is fair and likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation is hitting Bob much harder than it's hitting me. If I reject, I risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. This offer is reasonably close to what I was hoping for, so I'll take it."
