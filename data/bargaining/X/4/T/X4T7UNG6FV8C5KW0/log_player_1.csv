"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but still leave some for you.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple solution 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 50/50 split, as it would leave me with only $5,000, which is even less than my original proposal of $8,000. I'd like to make a new proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount, hoping you'll accept this compromise.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $7,000 and Bob receives $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's still a significant amount of money, and I'm not sure if I can do better in future rounds. Additionally, the inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money, so I'd rather take what I can get and move on."
