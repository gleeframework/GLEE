Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this goes on, the less we both get.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Take the deal now before inflation eats away at our potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
