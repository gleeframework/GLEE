Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both getting closer to a solution. Let's split the difference, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly using a strategy of mirroring my offers but keeping the larger share for herself.  While she suggests a ""split the difference"" approach, she's not actually moving towards a fair middle ground. I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a lopsided deal."

Round 6

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but this is my final offer. Let's close this deal and avoid leaving empty-handed.""

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. This is a fair compromise. Let's agree and move on. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to the mirroring tactic, but we're now at a point where the split is getting closer to reasonable. Accepting this offer guarantees a good payout, and the alternative is risking everything in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure a win now than to push for a slightly larger share and potentially lose it all."
