"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. Although I get less than I offered in the first round, the inflation is hitting Bob harder, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
``` 

I'm offering a more balanced split this time. The inflation is still working in my favor, but I want to avoid going too far and risking Bob rejecting the offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Even though the inflation is hurting me more now, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm holding out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

With inflation hitting us both harder, I'm offering a 50/50 split.  This should be appealing to Bob, especially since he's been getting a larger share in the previous rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Despite the significant inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer is still very unequal, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share.  I'm hoping to convince him to come closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm offering a split that's closer to Bob's previous offer but still slightly more in my favor. The inflation is hurting me significantly, but I need to make sure the offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that we can both agree on."
