"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm framing it as a fair start, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $500,000, which is worth 80% of the original $600,000 I proposed in Round 1. Not a bad compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now and see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to adjust my offer to take into account the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to account for inflation, still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. I'm framing it as a fair deal that takes into account the inflation, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to account for inflation, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $475,000, which is worth 47.5% of the original $1,000,000. That's a significant drop from my original proposal, but Bob's offer is now more generous than mine was in Round 3.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
