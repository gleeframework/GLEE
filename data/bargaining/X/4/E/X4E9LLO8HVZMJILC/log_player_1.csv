"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest. You can't do better than this, can you?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, which is a generous offer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to meet Bob in the middle just yet. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob! I'll give you $300,000, but I'm taking the lion's share. Don't make me regret it!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself, considering the inflation is eating away at our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to get left with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on me now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not getting any younger, and the thought of the money being worth even less in the next round is daunting. I'll take the $400,000 and call it a day."
