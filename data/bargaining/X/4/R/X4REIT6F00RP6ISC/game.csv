7000.0,3000.0,I propose we divide the money with a 7:3 ratio in favor of Alice. This seems fair given the initial value and the risk of inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"I propose a 4:1 ratio in favor of me, considering the inflation rate is lower for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Considering the inflation rates and Bob's previous offer, I propose a more balanced 3:2 ratio in favor of Alice. This maintains a reasonable advantage while acknowledging the value difference between our currencies.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share given the inflation rates. This is my best offer so far.",Bob,4,
