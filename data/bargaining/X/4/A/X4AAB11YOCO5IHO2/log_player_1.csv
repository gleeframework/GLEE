"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair offer, with me getting 60% of the total amount and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my offer from the previous round would have been worth 5% less, so I would have gotten 5700 and Bob would have gotten 3300.

Bob's new offer is 4500 for me and 5500 for him, which is even more favorable to him than my original offer. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer from the previous round would have been worth 5% less, so I would have gotten 5409 and Bob would have gotten 3591.

My new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```

This is a slightly more generous offer to Bob, hoping to increase the chances of acceptance."
