"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly skewed deal.  I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate.  What do you think?

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was quite cheeky Alice!  I'm willing to be generous, but let's be realistic. This is a much fairer split.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try a 50/50 split.  This is fair and avoids further losses due to inflation.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Taking inflation into account, this is a good deal for Bob. Accepting a 50/50 split now prevents further losses from inflation in subsequent rounds."
