"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $45 and kept $55 for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I assumed that the 5% inflation would be applied after this round, so the values I provided are based on the original $100 amount.)\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 5% less, I need to consider the adjusted values. With the 5% decrease, the original $100 is now worth $95. This means that the offer of $45 for me is actually worth $42.75 in original value ($45 / 1.05), and Bob's share of $55 is worth $52.38 in original value ($55 / 1.05).\n\n###\n\nConsidering this, I don't think an even split is fair, given that Bob is offering me the lower amount after the first rejection. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the original $100 is now worth $90.25 due to the 5% decrease in value over two rounds ($100 * 0.95 * 0.95).\n\n###\n\nConsidering this, I will adjust my offer accordingly. I'll offer Bob a bit less than before to make up for the loss in value and to try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's decision!\n\n###\n\nNote: The values I provided are based on the original $100 amount, but keep in mind that the actual value is now $90.25. My offer of $52 for myself is actually worth $46.85 in current value ($52 * 0.9), and Bob's share of $48 is worth $43.20 in current value ($48 * 0.9)."
