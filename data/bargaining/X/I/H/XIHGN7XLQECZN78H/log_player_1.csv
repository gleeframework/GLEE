"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as the first round showed we can both benefit from a more balanced distribution.  Let's work together to find a solution that's fair for both of us before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
