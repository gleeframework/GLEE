Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more fair this time.  I'll take 60, and you can have 40.  We can split the money more evenly, or we'll both end up with less if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
