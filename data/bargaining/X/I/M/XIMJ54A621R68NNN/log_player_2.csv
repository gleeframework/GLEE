"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's risky to accept such a low offer in the first round, especially considering the inflation factor. There's a good chance I can get a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to bite, and this offer is significantly better than what I was offered in the first round. Accepting now is the safer option."
