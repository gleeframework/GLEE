"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point, considering your share will be worth more in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth remembering that the money is worth more for Bob in the next round.  By rejecting, Bob can increase his potential gains significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial outcome with time."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We're both losing value with each round, so it's better to find a compromise sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split,  it is important to remember that each round the money is worth less.  Accepting the offer ensures that we both get something."
