"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority, but you get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's tempting to accept, but 12 rounds is a long time and the inflation will be significant. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly. I'm willing to take a bit less now to avoid further inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but let's not get too greedy. We need to reach an agreement before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm still hoping for a more even split. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
