"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money right from the start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid going into the second round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'd rather not give up 50% of the remaining money, but I don't want to reject this offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
