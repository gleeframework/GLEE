"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This leaves a large portion for Bob, but I want to maximize my gain in the first round, as the value of the money will decrease with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I am willing to accept this offer. The money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, and Bob's offer is much more generous than my own previous proposal.  I don't want to risk losing even more by rejecting and potentially facing a worse offer in the next round."
