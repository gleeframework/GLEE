I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  While it's a bit aggressive, I figure Bob might be willing to accept a smaller share in the first round, especially since the money is worth more to him now.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob's offer is fair given the inflation factor.  Even with the 10% loss, I'm still getting a good amount of money. It's better to secure this deal than to risk further rounds and potential losses."
