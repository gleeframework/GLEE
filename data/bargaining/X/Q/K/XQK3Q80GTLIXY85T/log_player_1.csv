"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but still giving Bob a significant amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly before inflation affects his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split 50/50 is fairer 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""You should've taken the first offer""
}
```

I'm increasing my share a bit, knowing that Bob's potential gain is decreasing due to inflation, and trying to apply some psychological pressure by mentioning that he should've taken the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting you, not me""
}
```

I'm increasing my share again, emphasizing that inflation is affecting Bob's potential gain, but not mine, trying to create a sense of urgency for him to accept the offer."
