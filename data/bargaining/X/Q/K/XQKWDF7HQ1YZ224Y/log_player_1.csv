"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be a little more efficient with our split. I'm offering you 4000, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you prefer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as I would have to settle for a relatively small share of the pie. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
