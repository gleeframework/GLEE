"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob made the same offer as I did in the first round.

I'll reject this offer as well. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering you 45 dollars, and I'll take 55 dollars."
