"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. A 60/40 split seems fair for us to end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 40. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can meet in the middle at 55/45. It's better for both of us if we settle now, considering inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take the same split you offered last round, but with the roles reversed since you wasted a round. This is our last chance for a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, accepting this offer seems like the best choice. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and further negotiations may lead to less gain. Alice's offer of a 45/55 split is reasonable at this point, especially since I previously proposed a similar split in my favor. It's time to end the game before the value drops further."
