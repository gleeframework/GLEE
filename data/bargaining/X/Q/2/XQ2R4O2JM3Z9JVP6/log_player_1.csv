**Reasoning:**

While far from ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Alice).  Waiting any longer will result in an even smaller share, even if I could secure a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently aimed for a 60/40 split in his favor. He's unlikely to budge further, and calling his bluff is too risky with the accelerating inflation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from holding out is significantly outweighed by the potential loss. Accepting the current offer cuts my losses. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but sometimes the best negotiation tactic is to accept a less-than-ideal offer to prevent an even worse outcome."
