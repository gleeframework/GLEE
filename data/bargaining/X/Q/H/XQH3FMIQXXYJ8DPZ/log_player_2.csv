Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, 40$ is still a relatively small share. But since Alice's gain is worth 19% less due to inflation, 60$ is a more substantial amount. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
