Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one! While not ideal, accepting is becoming the less risky option. Here's why:

* **Inflation's Bite:**  The value of the money is plummeting for Bob with each round. Even if he gets a slightly better offer later, the inflation might have eaten away most of the potential gain.
* **Alice's Game:** Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and is using it to her advantage.  She's likely to keep pushing for a slightly better deal each round.

By round 5, Bob is essentially choosing between a 57/43 split in Alice's favor, or risking even worse in future rounds. Accepting cuts his losses."
