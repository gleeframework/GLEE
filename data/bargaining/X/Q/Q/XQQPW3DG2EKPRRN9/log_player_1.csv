"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair and simple split! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, it's a bit more generous than my initial offer. And who knows, maybe Bob is willing to compromise. But I'm still not sure if I want to give up my 10% advantage.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 70-30 is a fairer split.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, how about 45-55? It's a slight lean towards you, but I think it's fair. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired 60-40 split, but I'm still not sure if I want to accept.

I'll think about it...

Hmm... 45-55 is a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that extra 5% to Bob. On the other hand, Bob is willing to compromise and give me a slight majority.

I'll accept this offer.
