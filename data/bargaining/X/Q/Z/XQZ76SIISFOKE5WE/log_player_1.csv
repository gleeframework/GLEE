"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping Bob will accept it. I figure he might be tempted to take the $1000 rather than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a fair offer, and I'd rather get $5000 than risk getting nothing by rejecting it."
