"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
This is a classic game theory scenario, and as Alice, I'm going to start with a slightly aggressive offer. I want to secure a large portion of the money while leaving Bob with a small amount, hoping he'll accept it rather than risk losing a significant amount due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm losing value due to inflation, I'm still in a strong position. I can risk another round and propose a more even split, knowing that Bob is also facing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more equitable split this round.  I'm willing to give up some of my potential gains to try and secure a deal before further inflation erodes our earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's less than I would have preferred, the inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all."
