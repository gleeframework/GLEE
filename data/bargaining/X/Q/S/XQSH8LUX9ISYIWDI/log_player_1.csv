"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI hope Bob accepts this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic Alice. I'm willing to give you a generous offer considering the time value of money, but it has to be worthwhile for me to accept. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 is the most reasonable deal considering the inflation!""}### 

I'm hoping Bob sees the reasonableness in this offer, considering we both lose out a bit due to inflation. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. The clock is ticking and the money is losing value. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

I think it's time to accept the offer. The inflation is taking a significant toll on the value of the money, and Bob's offer is relatively fair considering the circumstances. I don't want to risk losing even more value by prolonging the game."
