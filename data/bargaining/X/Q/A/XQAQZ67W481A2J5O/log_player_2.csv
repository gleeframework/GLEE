Alice's offer:

This offer is incredibly unfair. Even though there's inflation, it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give Alice half the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the first round, it's still not a fair split. I'm going to keep rejecting until we reach a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}
```

I'll offer Alice a 60/40 split.  This acknowledges the impact of inflation for her while still being a more balanced proposal."
