Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be a little more flexible. I'm willing to take a bit less if you meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and I need to make it worth my while.  This is my final offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a slight risk and offer you less.  We need to make a deal soon, or both of us will lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean Bob loses a significant chunk of the initial value due to inflation. He needs to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this goes on. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is steadily eating into Bob's potential gains. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing at all if the rounds run out. This offer presents a firm but fair compromise."
