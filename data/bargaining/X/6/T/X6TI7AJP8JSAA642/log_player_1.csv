"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too lopsided Alice. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
