"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 80% and you take 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly!  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think splitting it evenly is the fairest way, considering the initial proposal I made in Round 1 was already a relatively generous offer. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I can do better than that. I'll take 60% and you take 40%. What do you say?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 5% less now, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 60% and you take 40%. It's a fair split, considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

I'm sticking with my previous offer, but with a slightly adjusted amount to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give Bob a 55-45 split, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 55% of the remaining value. I'll take 55% of the remaining value, and you can take the rest. That's a fairer split, considering the current value of the money.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to make sure I get a decent amount. This is my final offer for now.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
