60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can work out a more even split later if you'd like.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?  It's still in your favor, considering the inflation, and we can wrap this up quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be reasonable.  With inflation biting into our gains, a 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We can both get a decent amount, and it's a good starting point for further negotiations.",Alice,3,
