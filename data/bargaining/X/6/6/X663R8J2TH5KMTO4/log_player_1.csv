"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 50-50 split, and I think I can do better. I'll pass on this offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a slightly better deal, while still being reasonable."
