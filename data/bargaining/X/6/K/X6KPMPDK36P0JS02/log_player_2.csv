"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal! Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous this round, but I'm also looking out for myself! I'm sure we can come to a fair agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a good compromise considering the inflation factor. It's a better deal than my last offer and it's reasonable to split the money closer to the middle."
