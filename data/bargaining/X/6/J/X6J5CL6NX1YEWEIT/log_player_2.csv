"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I lose money to inflation with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair in the sense of splitting the money roughly in half,  Alice gets a bigger share because of inflation. Since we have 12 rounds to work with, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split,  keeping in mind the inflation that's affecting both of us. It's a good starting point for a more even distribution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I need a better deal to account for the inflation, Bob. This is my final offer above 5500. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While it's still not ideal, I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, the inflation will continue to erode my potential gains. Getting 4200 is better than nothing if we reach the final round and both get nothing."
