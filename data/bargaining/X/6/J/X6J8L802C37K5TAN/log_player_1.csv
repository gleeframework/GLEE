"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Since Bob's offer is still a 60/40 split, but with a smaller share for me, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share for myself this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which should give me a slightly larger share than before. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
