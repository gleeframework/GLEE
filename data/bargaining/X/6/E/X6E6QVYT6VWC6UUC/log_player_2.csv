Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a bigger share, Bob, but I believe this is a more equitable split.  Let's work together to get the most out of this deal before the money shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a fair split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The devaluation of the money is a significant factor, but not enough to accept a deal where I get less than half. I'm going to push for a slightly better outcome while there's still time."
