I'm proposing a 900,000$ to 100,000$ split in my favor.  This seems fair given the potential for inflation, and I hope Bob will agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though the money I gain is worth 10% less than the first round, I'm still getting a decent amount ($100,000).  It's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the next round, as Bob's share will be even more reduced due to inflation."
