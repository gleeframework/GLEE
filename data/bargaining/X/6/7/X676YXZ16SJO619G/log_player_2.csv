# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should accept this before the inflation gets worse for you 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While her offer might seem tempting as the value decreases, it's important to hold firm. Accepting a poor offer sets a bad precedent for future rounds. We're getting into the later rounds, but there's still time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want to reach a deal. I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to be fair for both of us considering the inflation.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** This offer acknowledges the need to move towards a deal and shows flexibility.  
* **Highlighting fairness:**  Reminding Alice of the inflation reinforces that a 50/50 split isn't truly fair in the long run.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The slight concession leaves space for Alice to counter-propose, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable outcome in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, this is a good deal considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point, and the inflation is becoming critical.  While Alice's offer is still not ideal, rejecting it risks walking away with nothing.  It's better to secure a deal now, even if it's not perfectly in line with the initial goal."
