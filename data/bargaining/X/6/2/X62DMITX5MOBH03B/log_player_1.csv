Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I believe a 60/40 split reflects a more balanced approach. We can work something out if you're not satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
