"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm not sure if I want to accept such a big difference in the first round. I'll see what kind of offer I can get by rejecting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I believe a 60/40 split reflects a more balanced approach. We can work something out if you're not satisfied.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still feel 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice has moved closer to a more even split, and considering the inflation, taking a 40/60 split is a good deal.  I'm happy to accept."
