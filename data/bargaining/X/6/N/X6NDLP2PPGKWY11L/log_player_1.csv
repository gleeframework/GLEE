Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, since we both lose value as time goes on.  This way we both maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing value here. Let's make a deal that favors me slightly this time, as you got the better end of the deal last round.  We can then split evenly in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While it's true that we're both losing potential value due to inflation, the impact is far greater on me. Accepting an offer where I get significantly less than Bob sets a bad precedent for future rounds.  I need to hold out for a fairer deal, even with the time pressure."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5220,
""bob_gain"": 4780,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I can propose something that even remotely benefits me.  We both know you'll take the lion's share if it goes to the next round. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is crucial. It reflects a sense of urgency while still aiming for a somewhat balanced outcome. Here's why:

* **Last Chance:** This is likely the last round where Alice has a reasonable chance of securing a favorable outcome.  
* **Preempting a Worse Outcome:** By highlighting the consequences of going to the next round (where Bob will likely propose a heavily skewed split in his favor), Alice adds pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Slight Edge:**  While not ideal, the offer still gives Alice a slight edge over a 50/50 split, acknowledging the time pressure. 

This offer aims to be persuasive and realistic, increasing the chances of Bob accepting it."
