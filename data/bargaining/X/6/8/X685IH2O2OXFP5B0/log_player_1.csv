Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than Alice's offer. I propose we split it 5500 for me and 4500 for you, keeping in mind the inflation will make the money less valuable with each round. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
