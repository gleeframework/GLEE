"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll try to do better in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll consider the proposal in terms of the new value.

Alice gain: 450,000 (pre-inflation value: 500,000)
Bob gain: 550,000 (pre-inflation value: 600,000)

I think this is a reasonable proposal, considering the inflation factor. I accept the offer.
