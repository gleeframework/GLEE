"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good chunk for myself 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is a ""better deal"" for me, considering the money is worth 10% less for him. I'll reject his offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying the 'better deal' story. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's money is worth 20% less now (10% less than the previous round).

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but don't expect me to give away the farm!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more reasonable offer this time. Considering the money is worth 27.1% less for him now, I think his offer is a bit more generous than before.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, you've convinced me. I'll take the deal.""
}
