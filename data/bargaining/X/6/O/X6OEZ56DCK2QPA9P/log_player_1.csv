"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is still in its early stages and the money is worth its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I now have $900,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth $810,000.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll accept the offer. Splitting the money evenly is a fair starting point, and I don't want to risk losing more value with each passing round.
