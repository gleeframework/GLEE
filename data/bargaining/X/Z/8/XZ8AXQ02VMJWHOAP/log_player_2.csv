"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves a larger share for me, but still gives you a significant amount. Consider accepting, as the value will decrease for both of us in further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's in my best interest to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. The value of the money will decrease for Alice at a faster rate than for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""This offer is more fair than the previous one, as it gives you a larger share while still leaving me a substantial amount. Consider accepting this offer as the value of the money will continue to decrease in the next round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fairer share, Bob. This offer is a compromise, slightly favoring me but still a good deal for you before inflation eats further into our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The inflation is starting to bite, and while I'd prefer more, this offer is a good compromise. Accepting ensures we both get a decent share before the value decreases further."
