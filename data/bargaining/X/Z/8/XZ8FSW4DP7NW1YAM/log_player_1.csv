"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair starting point. I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor, since the inflation rate is much higher for Bob. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is fair, and it's better than waiting for another round, where the inflation will further decrease the value of the money for me. I'll accept!"
