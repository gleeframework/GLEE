"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too greedy, now it's my turn to make a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject this offer because I'm still getting a relatively smaller share, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45."
