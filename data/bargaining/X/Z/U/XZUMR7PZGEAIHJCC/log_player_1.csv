"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly. I want to see how Bob responds and whether he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than my previous one in terms of absolute dollar amount, it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation factor. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but I'm hoping the inflation factor will make it more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is significantly worse than the previous rounds in terms of absolute dollar amount, it's the best I can get considering the inflation. The value of my share has decreased significantly, and Bob's offer is the only way to avoid further losses."
