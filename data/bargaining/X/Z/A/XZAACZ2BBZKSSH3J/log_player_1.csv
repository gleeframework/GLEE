"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, a good starting point!""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, with me getting 6000 and Bob getting 4000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20:80 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll need to think about the long-term consequences.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Compromise is key, let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a 45:55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still gives me a decent chunk of the money. I hope Bob will consider this a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is worth a lot less now! I'm not thrilled about the 30:70 split, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is still willing to compromise, I'll think about it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to negotiate further in the future."
