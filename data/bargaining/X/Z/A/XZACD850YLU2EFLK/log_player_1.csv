"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a fair offer, giving Alice 60% and Bob 40% of the money.  It's a good starting point, but I'll be watching the inflation factor closely!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is tempting, the inflation hurts me more than Bob. I'll stick with my strategy of offering a fair split and see if I can get Bob to accept in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

I'm going to slightly adjust my offer, recognizing that Bob is more sensitive to inflation. By offering a slightly smaller split, I hope to appeal to his desire to get a larger share, while still maintaining a reasonable gain for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for Bob, it's starting to catch up to me as well.  Given that I've been trying to be fair, and it seems Bob is now more concerned with a quick resolution than a larger share, I'll accept his offer."
