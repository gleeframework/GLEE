"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Take 40 and let's move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer considering the pressure of inflation and the limited number of rounds we have left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's move on from here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 20% less than in the first round, which means the effective value of the $45 I'd get is $36. 

I'd rather wait for a better offer, so I'll reject Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's the fairest way to end this.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finally end the game."
