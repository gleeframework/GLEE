"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  I believe this is a fair offer considering I'm proposing first. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The 60/40 split doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth 10% less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split, considering we're now in the second round and the money is worth 10% less. Let's be fair and end this game now.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made a counteroffer that gives me a slightly larger share, while still being relatively fair. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer and we can end the game before the money loses more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about fairness and the decreasing value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer in the third round. Although the money is worth 19% less than in the first round, I believe that accepting this offer is the best decision given the circumstances. Meeting halfway between our previous offers seems like a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value in future rounds. It's better to secure the 45% now rather than taking a chance on getting a potentially worse deal in the next round."
