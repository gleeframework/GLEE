Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, inflation eats away at Alice's potential gains. Waiting longer means a smaller share, even if she manages to negotiate a slightly better split.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share.  His offer is unlikely to improve significantly, and he's likely aware of the pressure inflation puts on Alice.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees Alice $4,200. Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in Round 5 is very risky. Bob might offer even less, and the inflation impact will be even harsher.

**It's important to note:**  This game highlights the power dynamics in negotiations where one party is significantly less affected by time constraints."
