"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice. I'll give you a fair share, but you'll have to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $180,000
* Bob's gain: $720,000

I'm not accepting this offer. It's still a bit too skewed towards Bob's gain.
