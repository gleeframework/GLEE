**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the money loses value for her. While her offer is better than the 60-40 split initially proposed, I believe there's still room to push for a larger share in the upcoming rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  A 50/50 split is fair, and Alice is running out of time to get anything close to her initial ask. This offer puts the pressure on her to accept a reasonable deal before inflation erodes her potential gains even further."
