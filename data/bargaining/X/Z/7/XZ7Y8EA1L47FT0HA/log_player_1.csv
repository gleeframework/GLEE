"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll get a better deal in the long run.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. My message is a bit cheeky, implying that I'm making a fair offer, but also hinting that I'll be the one who'll come out on top in the long run."
