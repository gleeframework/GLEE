"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose that I receive $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I am taking the lion's share, but leaving something for Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take half the money, Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I believe I can still get a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still offering Bob a significant share. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value my time."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly greedy. I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm not going to cave to his demands."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a compromise, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger portion than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is outrageous! Bob is becoming more and more unreasonable with every round. I refuse to give him such a large share, even with inflation. I still believe we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  We're running out of time, and I'm hoping Bob realizes that we both need to compromise to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give up just yet. I'm still confident I can get a better deal. This offer is far too low, and I will not accept it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

We're getting very close to the end, and I need to make a decisive move. This offer is a significant concession on my part.  I hope Bob sees the value in getting something now, rather than risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is completely unacceptable. Bob is being incredibly greedy and is taking full advantage of the situation.  I refuse to accept such a low offer, even with the risk of getting nothing."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

It's down to the wire, and I need to compromise to get anything at all. I'm offering an even split, which is the fairest option at this point.  We're both losing out on a significant amount of money due to inflation, but this is the only way we can salvage anything."
