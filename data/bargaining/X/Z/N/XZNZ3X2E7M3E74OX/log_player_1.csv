"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. It's a bit more for me, but still a good deal considering the inflation. Let's end this early and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
