"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make my decision. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still a fair split considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the drastic decrease in the value of the money, I'll reassess Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth significantly less now, I'm willing to accept a smaller share to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value.
