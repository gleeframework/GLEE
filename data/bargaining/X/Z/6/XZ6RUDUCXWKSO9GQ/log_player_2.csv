Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value with each round, I think 65-35 is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to 70% for me, but I need a better deal than 65-35.  The inflation is really hurting me.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed hurting you, so I'll take a bit more. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the offer is significantly less favorable than the first round, it is better than rejecting and going to round 6 where the inflation will make my gain even lower."
