I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight advantage, but still offering a decent split.  Let's finish this! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's a good idea to take a significant advantage, especially with inflation happening. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
