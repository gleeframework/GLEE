"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too greedy in round 1, I'm taking a smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too greedy in round 1, does he?

Considering the offer, I'll have to accept a smaller share this time. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $300,000 and call it a day."
