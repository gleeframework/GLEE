"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. We can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly more aggressive offer. I'll take 40% and you can have 60% this time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more cautious with the inflation in mind. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too aggressive for me. I'd like to see a more even split. Let's try to meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to adjust my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split. I'll take 55% and you get 45%. We can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to a 50/50 split. I'll take 50% and you can have 50% this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll, my gains are decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be more careful. Since Bob is now offering a 50/50 split, I'll consider it a good opportunity to end the game. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
