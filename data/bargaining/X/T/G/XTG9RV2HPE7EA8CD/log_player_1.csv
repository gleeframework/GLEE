{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a 7,000 gain, which is 70% of the total amount. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, it's a more balanced split than previous offers.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that we can finally wrap up the negotiations and split the $10,000."
