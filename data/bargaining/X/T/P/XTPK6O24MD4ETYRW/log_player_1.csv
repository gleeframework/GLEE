"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take $600,000, which is 60% of the total amount, and Bob will receive $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. I've attached a message that says ""Let's be fair"" to convey that I believe this division is reasonable and fair for both parties. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more equitable split. This offer ensures you still receive a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the message suggests it's a more equitable split, the actual amounts favor Bob significantly, especially considering the inflation that has reduced the value of the money for both of us. Given that the money is worth less in this round, I believe I can propose a better division in the next round that would be more beneficial to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""50/50 split considering inflation""}\n\nIn this round, considering the impact of inflation on both of our gains, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This division is straightforward and splits the remaining value equally between us, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. The message ""50/50 split considering inflation"" aims to convey that this offer is a fair division under the current circumstances, acknowledging the loss of value for both parties."
