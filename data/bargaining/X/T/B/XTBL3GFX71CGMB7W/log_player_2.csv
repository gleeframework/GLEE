"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, but I'm the one proposing first. Take this and we can end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob!  We'll aim for a much fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This is a much fairer split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split. We're both taking a loss from the initial offer, so let's work together. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of the decreasing value!  While 400,000 is better than our initial offer, it's still not a fair split. We can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking.""}
