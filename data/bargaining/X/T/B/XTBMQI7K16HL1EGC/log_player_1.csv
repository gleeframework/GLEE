"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can work with this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is better for both of us in the long run. Let's start with this and see where it leads. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob's offer is more even, I'll accept it for now.
