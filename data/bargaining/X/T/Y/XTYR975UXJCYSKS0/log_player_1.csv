"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, and Bob is trying to take advantage of it!

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I think I can do better than 30% of the original amount. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the original amount. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55-45 split, which I think is a more reasonable offer considering the current value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

After calculating the actual values, I realize that Bob's offer is equivalent to:

* Alice gain: 400000 / 0.5208 ≈ 769,230 (in the original amount)
* Bob gain: 600000 / 0.5208 ≈ 1,153,846 (in the original amount)

Considering the huge difference in the original amounts, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make an even better offer this time. Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll aim for an even higher percentage of the original amount. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a 70-30 split, which I think is a strong offer considering the current value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on Bob's offer!

After calculating the actual values, I realize that Bob's offer is equivalent to:

* Alice gain: 100000 / 0.3241 ≈ 308,756 (in the original amount)
* Bob gain: 900000 / 0.3241 ≈ 2,783,244 (in the original amount)

I think this is an extremely lopsided offer, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make an offer that's more reasonable considering the extreme inflation. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was so skewed, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair offer considering the current value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
