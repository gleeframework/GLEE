"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to set the tone for the negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'll adjust my calculations accordingly.

The total amount of money is still $1,000,000, but it's worth less than before. Let's assume the value of the money is now 95% of its original value, or 0.95 x $1,000,000 = $950,000.

Bob's offer is to split the money 40:60, which means I would get $400,000 and Bob would get $600,000. However, since the money is worth 5% less, the actual values are:

* My gain: $400,000 x 0.95 = $380,000
* Bob's gain: $600,000 x 0.95 = $570,000

Considering this, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I'd be getting significantly less than I think I should. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit more conciliatory, but still firm. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, I won't either. Time to meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'll adjust my calculations accordingly.

Bob's offer is to split the money 30:70, which means I would get $300,000 and Bob would get $700,000. However, since the money is worth 14.26% less, the actual values are:

* My gain: $300,000 x 0.8574 = $257,220

  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still not backing down!""
