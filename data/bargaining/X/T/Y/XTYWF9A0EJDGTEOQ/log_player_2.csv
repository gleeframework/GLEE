"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. With the inflation, the money is worth less for both of us, but more so for Alice. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n### {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You lose more value each round, so it's better to accept this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're both losing out with these delays. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### Considering the inflation and the fact that Alice is losing more value each round, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. Splitting the money evenly seems like a fair deal, and I don't think I can get a better offer in the next rounds."
