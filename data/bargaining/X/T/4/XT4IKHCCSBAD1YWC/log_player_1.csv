I propose a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both have an equal chance of making a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I propose a 50/50 split.  While I initially wanted a larger share, it seems clear that Bob is willing to fight for more, and the diminishing value of the money makes it more important to reach a resolution now."
