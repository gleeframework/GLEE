I'm going to start by being generous, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I won't accept this offer. Even with inflation, I can still get a much better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm still hoping for a good split, but I'm reducing my offer slightly to account for the inflation. Maybe Bob will be more reasonable this time around."

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse! I'm still holding out for a better deal. Even though inflation is hurting me, I'm not giving in to his greed just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm lowering my offer again, but still hoping to get a decent share.  Bob's greed is getting ridiculous, but I'm not going to give up just yet."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm still not going to accept this offer. Bob is taking advantage of the situation, and I'm not going to give him the satisfaction of getting away with it.  There's still hope that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer one more time, but I'm still holding out for a fair deal.  Inflation is getting serious, but I won't let Bob bully me into accepting his unfair proposals.  I'm hoping he'll finally see reason and agree to this split."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being greedy!  I'm feeling the crunch of inflation now, but I won't let him get away with this. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping he'll come to his senses and propose a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation is really hurting now, but I need to get something.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split, which is fair given how much the value of the money has decreased.  It's a last-ditch effort to avoid getting nothing!"
