"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

This is my first offer. I believe a 90/10 split is fair, considering we have many rounds to go and the money will lose value with time. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, even with inflation considered. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway, but I still believe a 80/20 split is fair considering the inflation that's already occurred."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer keeps getting worse, and the inflation is starting to really bite. I'm going to take a chance and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25} 
```

I'm going to try offering a compromise.  We're both losing money with each round, so I need to be flexible. I believe a 75/25 split reflects the current inflation situation and gives us both something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but with inflation accelerating, I'm starting to worry about the money decreasing in value too quickly.  Even though this is a 50/50 split, it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the end."
