"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less, this offer is actually more favorable to me than my initial offer. I'll accept it.
