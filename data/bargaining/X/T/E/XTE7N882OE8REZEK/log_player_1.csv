"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Divide equally, let's not risk losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to play it safe and divide the money equally. That's a reasonable proposal.

I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's split the money evenly and avoid further risk of losing value with each round."
