8000.0,2000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. We can re-negotiate if you don't like it.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split. You can have 40% and I'll take 60. Let's see if you agree.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 55% and you can have 45%. Let's see if this is more to your liking.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,I'm getting closer to a compromise. How about we split it 50-50? It's fair and we can both walk away with the same amount.,Bob,4,
