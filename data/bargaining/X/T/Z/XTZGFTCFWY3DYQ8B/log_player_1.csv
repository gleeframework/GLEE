Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $500,000."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting 20% less than I would have in the first round, I'll have to make a tough decision.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite unfavorable, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""You can't be serious with that offer, Bob! I'm willing to give you a better deal, but you have to meet me halfway.""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me in the middle."

# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in that easily, but I'll try to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the value of the money decreasing so much, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still not great, but it's slightly better than his previous one.
