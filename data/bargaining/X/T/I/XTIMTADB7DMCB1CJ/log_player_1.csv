"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'd rather get more money now than later. I accept Bob's offer.
