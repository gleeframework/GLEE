Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I want to keep some buffer for myself in case the inflation hits harder than expected. 
# Alice gain: 60
