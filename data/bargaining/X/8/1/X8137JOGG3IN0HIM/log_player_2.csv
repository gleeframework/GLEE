Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a more balanced split. I'll take 40%, you take 60%. We both get a decent share, and it's more realistic considering the inflation.
