"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40, considering the inflation risk I'm taking. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a 40% share, considering the inflation risk, it's better to see what Alice might propose in the next round.  I can potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate we're both facing. Let's be reasonable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer is actually more generous than it seems. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a 60/40 split, Alice is offering a better deal than her previous offer considering inflation. Taking 4200 is better than risking getting nothing in the end."
