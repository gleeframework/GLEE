Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I understand the inflation is affecting you, but my position is only getting stronger with each round. This offer is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
