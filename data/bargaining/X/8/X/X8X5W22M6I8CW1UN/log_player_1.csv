"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before responding. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider the value of my potential gain in the next round.

I'll reject this offer for now. My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, my offer will be slightly lower than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```"
