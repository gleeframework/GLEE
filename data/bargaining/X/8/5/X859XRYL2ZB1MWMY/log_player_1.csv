Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This is a fair offer considering I am the one initiating the game. Let's see if he agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it might seem tempting to take $10,  it's not worth it considering the rapid inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, with me taking 60% and Bob taking 40%.  I believe this is a fair compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's see if he accepts this offer."
