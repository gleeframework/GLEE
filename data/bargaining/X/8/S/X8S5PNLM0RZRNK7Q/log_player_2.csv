Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

""alice_gain"": 50,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While my patience is wearing thin, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than a 50/50 split after inflation is a bad idea. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Okay, I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but this needs to be reasonable. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're halfway through the rounds. It's time to start applying real pressure.
* **Strategic Concession:** Offering slightly more than 50% shows I'm willing to be flexible but sets a firm boundary.
* **Strong Language:**  ""Take it or leave it"" emphasizes the urgency and my dwindling patience with Alice's greed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point. Accepting a 44/56 split is far from ideal, but the alternative is risking a complete loss if we don't reach an agreement. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to take a reduced share now than risk getting nothing at all."
