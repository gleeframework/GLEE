Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me, but leaves Bob with something. I think it's important to try and establish a foundation for negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's clear that Bob is willing to negotiate and this offer is a significant improvement from the previous round. With the inflation rates, it's not worth risking another round."
