"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. I know there's inflation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, let's go with 60/40.  I'm confident we can both come out ahead in the long run.  What do you think?"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Can we try 45/55? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer. It's a better deal than I initially offered, and the inflation is making each round riskier."
