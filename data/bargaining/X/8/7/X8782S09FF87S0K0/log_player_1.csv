"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's go with 60/40.  I'm confident we can both come out ahead in the long run.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gains, and Bob is trying to take advantage of it.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While 60/40 is a generous offer, I'm not sure I want to give up that much. I'll have to weigh the potential long-term benefits of working together against the short-term gain.

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and I need to make a move. I'll try to make a counteroffer that will give me a bit more than Bob's previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Can we try 45/55?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
