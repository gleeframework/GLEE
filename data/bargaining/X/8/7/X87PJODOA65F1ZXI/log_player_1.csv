"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose to keep 90 dollars for myself and give Bob 10 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, as I am taking the majority of the money, but I am still leaving something for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation means that taking 75% is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
