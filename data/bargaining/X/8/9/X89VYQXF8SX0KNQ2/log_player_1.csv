"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the smaller share for now""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which means I'll take $8,000 and Bob will get $2,000. My message is a bit cheeky, hinting that I'm willing to take the smaller share, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and not pushing for a more even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's 50/50 offer because I'd rather try to get a better deal. With inflation reducing the value of my share, I'd like to aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss in purchasing power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting me even more, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal this time, but I'm still the smart one""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:2 split in my favor, which means I'll take $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. My message is a bit of a jab, trying to make Bob think I'm the clever one for making a better offer this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a worse deal, I'm the smart one now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really hitting me hard now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, I'd rather take the smaller share and end the game than risk getting an even smaller share in the next round. The value of my gain is already significantly reduced due to inflation, and I don't want to lose even more purchasing power. Bob's message is a bit of a jab, but I'm not falling for it this time!"
