"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering to give you $200,000 and take $800,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping you'll accept it and we can both get something!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $400,000 and you'll take $600,000."
