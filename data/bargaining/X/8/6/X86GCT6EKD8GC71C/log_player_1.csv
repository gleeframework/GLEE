"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split this time. I'll take 6000, you take 4000.  We can adjust it further in the next round if needed. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 55-45 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hitting both of us hard, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are biting!

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50-50 split seems fair, especially considering the impact of inflation on our gains. I'm glad we could come to an agreement!"
