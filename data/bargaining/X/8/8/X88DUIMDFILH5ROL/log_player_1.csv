"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. This leaves me with $6,000, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, but considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is 45% of the original $10,000, but taking into account the 20% reduction in value due to inflation. This leaves me with $5,500, which I think is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, but considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower gains.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
