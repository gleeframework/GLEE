While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to reject. It's early in the game, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. There are 12 rounds, and the money is worth less to me each round, so I need to play it smart!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than before, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to take the bigger share.  While the offer is slightly better than before, I'm going to keep rejecting until I get a more fair split. I'm losing more money with each round, so I need to be more assertive."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. We're both losing money with each round.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to meet in the middle.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, we're running out of time. I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. Even though time is running out, I'm not willing to settle for a deal where Alice gets a significantly larger share. I'm going to keep pushing for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. It's time to be realistic. Let's split it evenly and avoid getting nothing at all.""}
