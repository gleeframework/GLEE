Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 40/60 split is a more reasonable proposal, considering the inflation risk is still high, but we can still share the wealth. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
