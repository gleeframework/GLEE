"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I'm going to start with a very uneven offer. I figure Bob might accept it just to get something, but if not, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to get 50 dollars than to risk getting nothing at all."
