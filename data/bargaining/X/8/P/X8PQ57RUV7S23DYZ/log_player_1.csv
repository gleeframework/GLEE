"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself, with a message saying ""Let's be reasonable"". Hopefully, he'll see it as a fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it a little closer to the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'd rather try to get a better deal in the next round than accept $4,500, which is actually worth $4,275 in the original value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll offer Bob $4,300 and keep $5,700 for myself. My message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a fair compromise, as it's roughly the middle ground between our previous offers."
