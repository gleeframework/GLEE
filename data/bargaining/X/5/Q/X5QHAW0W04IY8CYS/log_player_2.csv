"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I believe this is a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself.  It's risky, but I think there's room to negotiate!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I think a 50/50 split is the most reasonable way to divide the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value decreases. I propose a slightly better offer for me, keeping it close to a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, time is running out.  This offer is close enough and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
