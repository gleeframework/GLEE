"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept 0 dollars! Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and leaves room for negotiation if Alice wants to be more generous."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is being greedy, and while 20 dollars is better than nothing, I still have a chance to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, hoping to find a compromise. 60 dollars is a fair share considering the decreasing value of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 40 dollars is tempting, the inflation is hitting hard, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll see what I can offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer again.  I'm hoping Alice realizes that the money will be worth less with each passing round and will be more willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really hurting now. 50 dollars is a decent share, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with the time running out.  I'll take it."
