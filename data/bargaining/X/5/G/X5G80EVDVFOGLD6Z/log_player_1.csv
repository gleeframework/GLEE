"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0
}
```

I'm proposing that I get all the money, and Bob gets nothing. This is a pretty aggressive start, but I'm hoping to set the tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to be more reasonable in the second round.

I'll consider the offer, taking into account that the money I gain is still worth 100% of its original value, but the money Bob gains is worth 95% of its original value (due to the 5% inflation).

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up 50% of the money yet, especially since the money I gain is worth its full original value. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is now worth 90.25% of its original value due to the 5% inflation in each round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original $100, which is 20 * 0.9025 = $18.05 in today's value. I'm keeping 80% of the original $100, which is 80 * 0.9025 = $72.20 in today's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate a deal.

Let's consider the offer, taking into account that the money I gain is still worth 100% of its original value, but the money Bob gains is worth 85.74% of its original value (due to the 5% inflation in the first round and the additional 14.26% inflation in the second and third rounds).

I calculate the value of the money Bob is offering me as 40 * 0.85 = $34.00 in today's value, and the value of the money Bob is offering himself as 60 * 0.8574 = $51.44 in today's value.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the original $100, especially since the money I gain is worth its full original value. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is now worth 76.54% of its original value due to the cumulative inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is 40 * 0.7654 = $30.62 in today's value. I'm keeping 60% of the original $100, which is 60 * 0.7654 = $45.92 in today's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's consider the offer, taking into account that the money I gain is still worth 100% of its original value, but the money Bob gains is worth 77.38% of its original value (due to the 5% inflation in the first round, 14.26% inflation in the second round, and the additional 22.62% inflation in the third and fourth rounds).

I calculate the value of the money Bob is offering me as 30 * 0.7738 = $23.22 in today's value, and the value of the money Bob is offering himself as 70 * 0.7738 = $54.06 in today's value.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the original $100, especially since the money I gain is worth its full original value. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is now worth 59.16% of its original value due to the cumulative inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering Bob 50% of the original $100, which is 50 * 0.5916 = $29.58 in today's value. I'm keeping 50% of the original $100, which is 50 * 0.5916 = $29.58 in today's value. This offer is a 50/50 split, which might be a more reasonable deal given the reduced value of the money."
