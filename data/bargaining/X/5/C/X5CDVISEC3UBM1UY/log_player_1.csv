"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. This is a relatively fair split, considering I'm the first to make the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and try to do better in the next round. Since the offer is still a 45-55 split, which is relatively close to my initial offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the two previous rounds). Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a slightly more aggressive split, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings.

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'm not sure if it's the best I can do, but it's a fair split. Considering the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, I think I should take what I can get.
