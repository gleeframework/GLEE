"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation penalty he'll incur if he rejects it. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's go 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, and considering Bob's offer gives me 45% of the total amount, I will reject it. I initially offered Bob 40%, so I'm hoping to get a better deal than 45% for myself. Plus, with each round, Bob's share becomes less valuable due to inflation, giving me more leverage.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob's share is worth 10% less with each round, and I'm trying to maximize my gain, I'll adjust my offer slightly to see if Bob will accept it this time. I'll increase Bob's share by a bit to make it more appealing, but not so much that it cuts into my desired gain significantly.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust to 58/42""}\n\n###\n\nI'm still aiming for more than half, but offering Bob a slightly better deal than before, taking into account the devaluation of his share due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds to this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's a good deal considering inflation is working against us. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given that Bob has stated this is his final offer and considering the impact of inflation on his share, I will accept this deal. The difference between what I'm getting and what I initially offered is not significantly large enough to justify further negotiation, especially since Bob seems firm on this being his last offer. With inflation continuously devaluing Bob's share, he might become more rigid in his negotiations or decide to end the game without a deal, which would result in both of us getting nothing. To avoid that risk, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game here and take the 480,000 dollars as proposed by Bob."
