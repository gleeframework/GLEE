"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I take the lion's share this round, and we'll work out a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the long-term consequences.  Accepting now means a very uneven split and puts me at a disadvantage for future rounds. It's better to reject and see what Alice proposes next, keeping in mind the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
