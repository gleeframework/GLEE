"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $60 and Bob $40, which is a 60/40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time, but it's still a generous offer. Accept? 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, Bob's offer is actually quite generous to me.

I'll accept the offer.
