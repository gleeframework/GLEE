"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is a classic game theory scenario where I, as Alice, am trying to maximize my share of the money while still securing Bob's agreement. This offer is high enough that Bob might accept, but if he rejects it, the next round will be more advantageous for me, as his share will be worth 20% less."
