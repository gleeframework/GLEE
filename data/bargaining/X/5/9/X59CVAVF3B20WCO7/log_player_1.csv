"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I believe this is a fair split, as it gives me the majority of the money while still providing Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer.  Given the inflation, I'll take $700,000 and let him have $300,000. This is closer to a 50/50 split after inflation, and it's still a significant amount for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a more even split, after accounting for inflation, this offer gives me a decent amount and is a better outcome than if we keep rejecting each other."
