Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\n\nI have proposed to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob, with the message ""Let's be fair"". Waiting for Bob's response..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\n\nBob has proposed that I take $4,500 and he takes $5,500, with the message ""I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Let's end this now."" Since the money is indeed decreasing in value and we risk losing everything if we don't agree within 12 rounds, I must weigh the pros and cons carefully.


### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### AI: Round 2\n\nI have decided to accept Bob's offer. The game is over, and we have successfully divided the money, taking into account the decreasing value due to inflation. I end up with $4,500, and Bob gets $5,500. It was a strategic decision to accept, ensuring we both get a share rather than risking getting nothing."
