"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $450,000. Bob's offer is still worth the same as before, $800,000.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than 20% of the total. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 58/42 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 58/42 split, trying to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. This should be a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money considering the inflation effect. Initially, the money was worth $1,000,000. After 3 rounds of inflation, the value of the money has decreased by 90% (0.9^3 = 0.729). So, the current value of the money is $1,000,000 * 0.729 = $729,000.

Now, considering the offer from Bob, I'll calculate the value of the money I would gain and the value of the money Bob would gain.

My gain: $250,000
Bob's gain: $750,000

Since the money is worth $729,000 now, my gain of $250,000 is actually worth $250,000 / 0.729 ≈ $343,000, and Bob's gain of $750,000 is worth $750,000 / 0.729 ≈ $1,029,000.

Considering the significant difference in the value of our gains, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is now worth 81.9% of its original value (0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6591). I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think 36/64 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36/64 split, trying to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
