""alice_gain"": 4500,

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a better deal 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and the value of the deal for her is rapidly decreasing. While not ideal, accepting this offer in round 5 secures me a reasonable amount ($4400) before Alice's offers potentially become even less favorable due to the inflation working against her."
