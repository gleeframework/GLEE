"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. You get a good chunk, and I get a bit more for making the first offer 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be reasonable. This is my final offer.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:**  Alice loses value much faster than Bob with each round. It's in Bob's best interest to push the game to later rounds if needed.
* **Strong Stance:**  The message is firm, indicating this might be Bob's best offer.  This could pressure Alice to accept, especially knowing her share decreases rapidly with each refusal.
* **Appearing Reasonable (While Still Advantageous):**  While tilted in Bob's favor, the 55/45 split might seem ""fair enough"" to Alice at this point, preventing her from getting overly emotional and refusing out of principle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said your last offer was final, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll take a bit less than my original offer, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Catching Up:** While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, it's getting closer to a more even split.  The longer Bob waits, the less attractive even a ""good"" offer becomes due to inflation.
* **Alice Might Be Getting Desperate:** Alice backing down from her 60/40 suggests she understands the impact of inflation and might be getting concerned about losing even more.  This could mean she's nearing her acceptance threshold.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Waiting another round to potentially squeeze out a slightly better deal is risky. If Alice gets too desperate, she might offer something entirely unacceptable, forcing Bob to either accept a terrible deal or walk away with nothing."
