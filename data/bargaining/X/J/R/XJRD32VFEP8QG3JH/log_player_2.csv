Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
Let's start with a 60/40 split.  I'm willing to give Alice a fair share, but I need to secure a decent amount for myself to counteract potential inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's getting a little close for comfort, but I still think I can push for a better deal considering the inflation on Alice's side is much higher than mine. I'm going to try to get a higher percentage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, aiming for a 65/35 split. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the inflation affecting Alice more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

With the inflation hitting Alice much harder, I'm going to accept this offer.  While it's not my ideal split, it's a decent gain and getting closer to the 50/50 mark.  I don't want to risk losing everything by being too greedy."
