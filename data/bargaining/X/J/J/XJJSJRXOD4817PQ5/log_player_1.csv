"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40. I think it's a fair offer considering I'm making a compromise and the money loses value for me with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
