"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I get to make the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I proposed a 70-30 split, which is equivalent to a 70-30 split in terms of the actual dollars I get. Now, in this round, Bob is proposing a 60-40 split, which is equivalent to a 60-40 split in terms of the actual dollars he gets.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually more favorable to him than my original proposal was to me. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the inflation effect, I decide to reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 65-35 split in my favor, with me getting 65 dollars and Bob getting 35 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""compromise"" to see how Bob reacts."
