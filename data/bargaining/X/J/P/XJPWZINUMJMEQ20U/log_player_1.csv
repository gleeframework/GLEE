"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the inflation is 20% less for me, my gain of 400,000 is actually worth 320,000 in ""real"" terms. Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 480,000 in ""real"" terms.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (80% of 80% of the original value), I'll propose a more aggressive split to account for the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm taking a bigger share this time, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Since the money is worth 48.8% of its original value, my gain of 300,000 is actually worth 147,600 in ""real"" terms. Bob's gain of 700,000 is worth 343,600 in ""real"" terms.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept it.
