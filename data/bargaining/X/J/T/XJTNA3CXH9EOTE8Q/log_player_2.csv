Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. My proposal is:
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my potential gain of 40$ is actually 40 * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = 32.4$ in the first round's value, which is not a bad deal. I'll accept this offer.
