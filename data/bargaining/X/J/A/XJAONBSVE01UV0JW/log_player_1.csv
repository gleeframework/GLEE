"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 

I'll start by being fair, but firm. I'll keep 90% and give Bob 10%.  Let's see if he accepts this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is better than nothing, but it's still not fair. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm willing to compromise a little, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. 80/20 seems like a good middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob finally came around!  50/50 is a fair split, and I'm happy to take it. No need to risk getting nothing at this point."
