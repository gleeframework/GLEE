"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit.""
}
``` 

This offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It gives Alice a favorable split but is still significantly better than what Bob can expect as the rounds progress and inflation eats into his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, but it's still not favorable considering the rapid inflation working against him. He needs to feel the pressure.  We'll counter with a stronger offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""This is a strong offer, Bob. The clock is ticking and our potential gains are shrinking.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Applying pressure:**  This offer is a bit more aggressive than our opening, but still reasonable.  We're emphasizing the time pressure and the fact that his potential gains are diminishing rapidly due to the 20% inflation he faces each round. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While we've increased our share, we're still leaving room for Bob to counter-offer with something above his previous proposal. The goal is to reach an agreement before the inflation makes any potential deal unattractive to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but I need a bit more to make this worthwhile. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the heat, and his offer reflects that. However, he's still trying to secure a slight majority.  We need to hold firm and demonstrate that time is on our side, not his. Accepting now would give him the better end of the deal, even with the inflation he's facing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair deal given the circumstances.  Let's be smart and walk away with something substantial.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Slight Concession:**  We're showing some flexibility by slightly reducing our demand from the previous round. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness and Urgency:**  The message aims to frame the offer as a reasonable compromise while reminding Bob that time is running out for both of us.  
* **Anticipating Acceptance:** Bob is likely to realize that his position is weakening significantly with every passing round. This offer might be his last chance for a reasonably favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit significantly. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Shift in Power Dynamics:** While not ideal, a 50/50 split is now a reasonable outcome. The significant inflation working against Bob has dramatically shifted the power balance in our favor.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for a slightly larger share, there's a real risk that Bob, in a desperate attempt to secure a better deal, might make increasingly unfavorable offers or even run the clock out. Accepting now guarantees a significant sum, which is better than nothing. 
* **Fairness:** Bob is finally acknowledging the need for a fair deal.  Accepting a 50/50 split at this stage demonstrates a willingness to compromise and end the negotiation on a positive note."
