"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the low offer, I'll get the majority! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a 233% share of the remaining money. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect too much!""}

I'm proposing that I get $450,000 and Bob gets $550,000. I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
