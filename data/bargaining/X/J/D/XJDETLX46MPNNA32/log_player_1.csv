Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 5500/4500 split in your favor, Alice.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor that favors you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This round, I propose a 50/50 split. Since Bob rejected my initial offer, and the inflation is impacting us both, a fair split seems like the best way to move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  Although it's not ideal, inflation is starting to impact us both significantly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
