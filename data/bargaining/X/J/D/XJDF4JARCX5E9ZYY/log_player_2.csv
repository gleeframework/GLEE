"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A slightly larger share for me, and we can both enjoy this money now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I think it's time we both got a little more. Let's split it more evenly this time, and we can both enjoy the money before it's worth less.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a slightly larger share, it's not worth risking another round of inflation. 50/50 is a fair deal."
