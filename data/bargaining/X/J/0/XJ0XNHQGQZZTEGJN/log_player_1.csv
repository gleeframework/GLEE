Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, Alice. Let's end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this round, Bob offers an equal split of $5000 each, but considering the inflation, Alice's gain is worth 20% less than the initial amount, while Bob's gain is worth 10% less. This means Alice would effectively get less value than Bob from the same nominal amount. Since Alice aims for a fair division considering the impact of inflation, she rejects this offer to try for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, in Round 3, the money is worth even less than in the previous rounds. To account for this, Alice needs to adjust her proposal to ensure fairness considering the devaluing money. Alice will propose a division that slightly increases her share to compensate for the greater loss in value she experiences due to inflation, compared to Bob. She also includes a message to Bob to justify her offer, emphasizing the need to consider the unequal impact of inflation on their gains.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split.""}"
