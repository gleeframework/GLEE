Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll try to get a better deal. Since Alice's offer is closer to the initial 50/50 split, I'll think it's a decent offer. I'll accept.
