Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer.  It seems like she might be willing to negotiate, but very slowly. I'll continue to reject slightly unfair offers to see if I can push for a better deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give up a bit more, but this is as low as I'll go 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  We are now past the halfway point of the rounds. While this offer isn't ideal, Alice has stated this is her lower limit.  If I reject and she's being truthful, the offers will likely only get worse for me from here on out. It's better to take a slightly unfavorable deal than risk getting nothing at all."
