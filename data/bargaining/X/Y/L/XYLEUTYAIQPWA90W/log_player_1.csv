  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I need to take that into account.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, meet me in the middle.""
}
```"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied, I'll take control now 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take control of the negotiations. Given the inflation rate, I'll need to take into account that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less.

However, Bob's offer is still a 55/45 split, which is even more in his favor than his previous offer. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any younger, time to make a deal.""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger either, meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure if it's a genuine attempt to compromise or just a ploy to get me to accept a slightly better deal for himself.

Given the significant inflation rate, I'll need to take into account that Bob's gain is worth much less than in the first round. However, the 52/48 split is still a relatively even split, and I might be able to get a better deal if I push further.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal.

# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate, and his offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split. Considering the extreme inflation rate, I'll need to take into account that Bob's gain is worth almost 80% less than in the first round. Given the circumstances, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal.

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point.
