Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to give up some of my share from the last round, but I still need a fair portion. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making concessions, the impact of inflation is becoming more significant. Accepting $4,000 now is a poor outcome compared to what we could potentially secure in future rounds if we play our cards right."
