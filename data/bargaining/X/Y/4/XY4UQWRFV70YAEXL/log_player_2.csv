"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want a fairer split than 40/60. I'll see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both need to agree on a division. Let's work together to make this work!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  Since we both rejected the previous offers, I suggest an even 50/50 split. This way, we both get something, and we avoid further devaluation of the money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking further devaluation and getting nothing."
