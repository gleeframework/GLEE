Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'll come down a bit, $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is incrementally reducing her demand, indicating a willingness to negotiate. While the offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. We're only in round 3, and time pressure is not a significant factor yet. By rejecting, I signal that I'm looking for a more balanced deal."
