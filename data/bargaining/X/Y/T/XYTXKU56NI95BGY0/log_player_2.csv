Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is only affecting you, I'll take a bit more. It's still a good deal for you before it devalues further. 
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Alice is taking a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money for me. It's better to accept and secure some of the money before it loses further value."
