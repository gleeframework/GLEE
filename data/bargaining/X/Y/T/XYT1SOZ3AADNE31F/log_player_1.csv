"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount to start, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 70-30. Let's start with 60-40.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 95% of the original amount, which is 38 dollars.

I'm not too happy with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting less money than before, I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60-40 is fair, considering the inflation. Let's try 55-45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so it's worth 95% of the value of the 40 dollars I would have gotten in Round 2, which is approximately 38 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. 45-55 seems like a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
