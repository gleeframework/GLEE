"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I still need a larger share. This offer is closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor.  The impact of inflation is also becoming significant. Accepting this offer would mean I get less than a third of the original value, which is a bad deal even with the threat of getting nothing. I need to push for a more equitable split."

""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. Inflation is eating away at the value, and we both lose if this drags on. I propose an even 50/50 split. It's fair, simple, and ensures we both benefit.""
