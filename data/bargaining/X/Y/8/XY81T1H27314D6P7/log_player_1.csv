"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done before the money loses too much value! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks it's a fair split, but I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, I'll offer a slightly lower amount to Bob. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
