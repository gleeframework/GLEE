"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%.  This seems fair considering I'm the one taking the initiative and offering a division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a decent amount.  Inflation is a factor, but I believe this is a fair compromise, especially given the risk of further rounds leading to even less for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm disappointed I'm receiving less than what I initially wanted, it's important to recognize the increasing impact of inflation. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to avoid further losses."
