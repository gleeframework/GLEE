Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. We both have to consider the inflation. A 50/50 split seems fair,  don't you think? We can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
