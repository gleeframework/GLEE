I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, considering I have the first offer, and Bob will have to deal with a 20% discount on his share in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a 800,000 to 200,000 split. Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm taking a slightly more aggressive stance. This takes into account the fact that Bob is now facing a 40% discount on his share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's important to consider the rapidly decreasing value of Bob's offer due to inflation.  Accepting 200,000 now is better than risking getting nothing in future rounds as the value of the money keeps shrinking."
