"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can see where we stand after the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $2,000 I'd gain is actually worth $1,600 in real terms, and the $8,000 Bob would gain is still worth $8,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll have to consider it. I'd rather not give up too much in the early rounds, but I don't want to risk going to the 12th round either.

I'll accept this offer.
