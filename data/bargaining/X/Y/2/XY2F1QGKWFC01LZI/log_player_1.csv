"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair offer and accept it, considering it's the first round and the money is still worth its full value. The message ""Let's make a fair deal!"" is meant to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split the difference. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, which gives me only 40% of the total amount. Considering the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'd like to try and negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Considering the 5% decrease in value for me, I'll aim for a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal but still higher than Bob's offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, considering inflation.""}"
