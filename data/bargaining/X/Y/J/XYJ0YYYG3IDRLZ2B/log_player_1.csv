I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, taking 90% for myself.  Since Bob's money loses value less quickly than mine, I'm hoping he'll take the deal rather than risk losing more in the next round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one. While it seems like a fair deal on the surface, I need to think about the long game. If I accept, I only get 100,000 now, which is worth even less after the 20% inflation.  

I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. Since I'm the one making the proposal then, I have more control."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal considering the inflation. Bob is aware of the decreasing value of his money too, and he might be more inclined to accept an offer that gives him a larger share now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I think I need to accept. Inflation has hit me hard, and my potential gains are dwindling rapidly. While I'd prefer a better split, I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the next round. Accepting now at least guarantees me a small amount of money, which is better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
