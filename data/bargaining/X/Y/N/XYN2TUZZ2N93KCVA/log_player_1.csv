"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take half, let's split it down the middle. No need to negotiate, let's end this quickly too. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
