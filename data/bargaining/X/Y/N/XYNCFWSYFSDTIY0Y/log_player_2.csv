This is a very lopsided offer, and it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal."

Let's start with a fair split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I still think I can get a better deal than this."

I'm willing to give Alice a slightly smaller share, but I still want a larger portion of the money."
