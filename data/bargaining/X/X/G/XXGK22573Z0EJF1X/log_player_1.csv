Let's start fair! I propose a 50/50 split."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm willing to go up slightly to 55 for me, but I still want a larger share since the money is worth less for me now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

I still think I can get a better deal, even with the inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my share again, as the inflation is really starting to hurt.  I'm willing to go up to 60 for me, but I need to get something decent out of this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still believe I can get a better deal. The inflation is hitting me hard, but Bob's offer is still too low considering how much value I'm losing.  I'll try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

The inflation is really hurting me now, but I need to secure a larger portion.  I'm going to push for 70 for me, leaving 30 for Bob. This is likely my last chance to get a decent share before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really hurting me now.  It's time to accept Bob's offer, even though it's not great.  I'm losing a lot of value, but getting nothing would be worse."
