Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I still need a good deal to make it worthwhile.  70/30 in my favor is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing, getting only $3,000 is a terrible deal for Bob. It's worth holding out for a better offer, as Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. The longer the game goes on, the more pressure there is on Alice to offer Bob a better deal."

{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the halfway point.  Let's be realistic - 70/30 is too far in your favor.  I propose a 55/45 split. This gives you a significant advantage, but acknowledges the impact of inflation on my side.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try to make progress. 60/40 in my favor is a fair compromise considering the inflation. I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing more flexibility, this offer is still not good for Bob.  It's the same split he proposed in Round 2, but now inflation has eroded the value significantly.  He needs to hold firm and push for a better deal, knowing that time is working against him."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now.  I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split.  This is fair and prevents either of us from feeling like we got a bad deal. Let's end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The longer the negotiations go on, the worse the deal becomes for Bob due to inflation.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially as they approach the halfway point. This firm offer emphasizes the need for a resolution while still being reasonable."
