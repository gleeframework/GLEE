"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more realistic.  I'm taking 60, you get 40.  We can still avoid the inflation risk by accepting this deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
