"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's a huge drop from my initial proposal. I'm hoping to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground. I'm reducing my share a bit, but I'm still aiming for a larger portion since I'm the one proposing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm still hoping to get a bigger share. I'll try to negotiate better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This time I'm proposing an even split.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and I think this is the fairest offer that I can make while still getting a decent amount.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous!  The inflation is really starting to bite now, but I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm making a slightly more generous offer to Bob than in the previous round, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  We're getting close to the end, and I want to ensure that we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting really dicey. I'm not happy with the offer, but the inflation is taking a huge toll.  I'm accepting this offer to avoid getting nothing at all."
