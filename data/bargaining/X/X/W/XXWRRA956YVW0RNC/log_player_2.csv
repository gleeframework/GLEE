"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the funds with a slight difference to ensure both of us benefit. This division aims for fairness. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Even though Bob gets 2500$ in the first round, this amount will be worth less in the subsequent rounds due to inflation.  Rejecting allows Bob to make the next proposal and potentially get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds due to inflation.""
