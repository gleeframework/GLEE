"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a bit unfair considering the inflation rate. Let's make it a clean 50/50 split and avoid further delays. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
