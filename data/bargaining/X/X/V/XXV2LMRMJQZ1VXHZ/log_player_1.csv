"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $600,000 gain from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000. And Bob's $400,000 gain is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, given that I've already taken a hit from inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the next round of inflation, my $480,000 gain from the previous round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $384,000. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000, which is a bit more than my current ""fair share"" of $384,000, and leaving $450,000 for Bob."
