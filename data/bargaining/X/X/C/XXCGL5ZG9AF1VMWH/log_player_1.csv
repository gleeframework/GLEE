"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to counter with an offer that gives me a slightly higher share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a 30% share, and keeping $700,000 for myself."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 40/60 split, which is closer to my previous offer, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. I'm still hoping to get a better deal."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bigger chunk of the pie to make it worth my while.""
}
```

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a compromise. I need more than 200000, and I think 300000 is a reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 30/70 split, which is closer to my previous offer, but still not as favorable as I'd like. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's a compromise that gets me a decent share of the money."
