Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, not acknowledging the impact of inflation on my gains. While her offer is slightly better, it's not enough of an improvement to warrant accepting.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share before we run out of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic. Inflation is hurting my gains every round. This offer is fair and gives us both a decent share.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation may be hurting your gains, but I'm not going to give in that easily 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is running out.  While Alice's offer is far from ideal, it's better than nothing, which is what we both get if we don't reach an agreement soon. Accepting now cuts my losses and secures me something rather than risking it all for a potentially slightly better deal in later rounds."
