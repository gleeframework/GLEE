,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me taking the larger share since I'm the one making the offer this round.  Let's see if you agree.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a compromise considering the time pressure and inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to go down to a 55/45 split, but I'm sticking with my higher share.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers with inflation ticking up.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split - it's a small concession on my part, and shows I'm willing to compromise. Let's close this deal before we both lose out.",Alice,5,
