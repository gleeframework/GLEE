"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70:30 split, which is roughly a 70% to 30% split. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new values, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I want to give him 80% of the remaining money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40:60 split, which is a more equal distribution of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. You'll have to do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

However, Bob's offer is extremely aggressive, and I'm not willing to give him 90% of the remaining money. I'll have to think of a new strategy to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to come up with a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less, I'll have to be even more careful with my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, Bob. But I need something in return.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25:75 split, which is a significant concession on my part. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept, but I'm also trying to leave room for negotiation and see if I can get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not interested in negotiations. I'm taking what I want. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really ravaging the value of the money! With the money I gain being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm getting extremely desperate.

However, Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. Giving him 95% of the remaining money is outrageous, and I'm not willing to accept it.

I'll reject this offer and try to think of a new strategy, but I'm running out of options.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less, I'm left with very little to negotiate with. Here's my final offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5,
  ""bob_gain"": 95,
  ""message"": ""I'm giving up. Take it all, Bob. I'm done.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 5:95 split, which is essentially giving Bob the majority of the remaining money. I'm not sure what else I can do at this point, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer and end the game."
