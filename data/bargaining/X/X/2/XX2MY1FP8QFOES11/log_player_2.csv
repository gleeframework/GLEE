"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but you get a small piece.  Accept this and we're done! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to settle for just $10!  Let's see what Alice's next offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This is a fair offer, Alice. We both get a good chunk of the money, and we can move on.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair deal, and we both get a good amount. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

An even split is a fair deal.  It's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
