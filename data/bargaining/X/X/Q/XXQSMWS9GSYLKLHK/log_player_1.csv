```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer as I was about my initial one.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a better deal this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I think this offer is more reasonable. It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept this offer.
