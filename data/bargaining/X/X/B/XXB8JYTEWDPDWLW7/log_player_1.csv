"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take half, you can take the other half. Simple and fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A straightforward proposal from Bob!

I'll consider his offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal. The money is worth less, but I still want to aim for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a bigger share now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now!

I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the value of the money has decreased significantly, I'll think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. $4,500 is a decent amount, considering the decreasing value of the money. It's better than risking going to the next round and facing even lower values."
