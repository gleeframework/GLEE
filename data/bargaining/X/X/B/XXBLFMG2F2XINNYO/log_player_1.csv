"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 450,000 is now worth 405,000, and Bob's gain of 550,000 is now worth 440,000. It's a bit more favorable to me, but I'll consider it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, my gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, so it's now worth 363,000. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values for round 4:

My gain of 500,000 is worth 73,000 (since it's 27.1% less than the original 1,000,000, and 73,000 is 10% less than the 81,000 I would have gotten in round 2).

Bob's gain of 500,000 is worth 55,000 (since it's 48.8% less than the original 1,000,000).

It's a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable offer considering the inflation. I'll accept it.
