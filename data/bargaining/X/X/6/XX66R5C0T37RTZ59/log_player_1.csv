Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I propose 60/40 in my favor, considering the inflation factor will benefit you more in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
