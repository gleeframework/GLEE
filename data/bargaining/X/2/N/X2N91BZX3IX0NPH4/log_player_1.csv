"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but leaves Bob with a small amount.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him into accepting, as the inflation will significantly impact him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is not ideal,  the inflation rate will make it significantly harder for me to get a better deal in the future. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, whereas rejecting could lead to me getting nothing at all."
