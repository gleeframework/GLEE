Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A tiny bit more for me, considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my shrinking pot.  While 43 is a reasonable amount in this round, if I hold out longer, she might be forced to offer even more to avoid getting nothing in the end."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, and I'm taking a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is slipping away. While not ideal, 41 is better than nothing, which is what we'll both get if we don't reach an agreement soon. Alice is unlikely to offer more, knowing I'm feeling the pressure of inflation."
