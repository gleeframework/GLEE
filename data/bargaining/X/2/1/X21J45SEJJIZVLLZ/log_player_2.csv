"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose value over time, but you lose it faster. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, it's important to remember the inflation rates.  Since I lose value faster, I need to be more aggressive in securing a larger share early on.  Rejecting this offer sets the stage for me to make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think a more equitable split reflects the disparity in our inflation rates. This proposal gives you a fair share while ensuring I can maximize my returns before the value diminishes too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, our rates are tough, but letting rounds pass hurts us both. I'm willing to adjust, but 60/40 in your favor is too steep. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is an improvement, it still doesn't fully account for the difference in our inflation rates. The value of my share is dropping significantly faster, and I need to ensure a larger share to make this worthwhile. Rejecting this offer gives me another chance to push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of our shares keeps shrinking. I'm willing to compromise, but a 55/45 split is the most I can offer while still ensuring my losses are minimized. Let's reach an agreement before the opportunity cost becomes too great for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. This offer is a slight adjustment â€“ let's close this out before the inflation eats away at the value even further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer, while acknowledging the inflation issue, still undervalues my share. It's crucial for me to secure a larger portion of the pie considering the significant loss of value in my gains.  The remaining rounds are dwindling, but I need to hold out for a more favorable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. This is a crucial point for us to reach an agreement.  I'm offering you 40%, which is still a fair amount considering your slower inflation rate. We need to act quickly to prevent further losses.""}
