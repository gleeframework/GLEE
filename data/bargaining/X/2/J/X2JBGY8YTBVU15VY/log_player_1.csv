"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer seems fair. I am proposing to keep 999,000 dollars and give Bob 1,000 dollars. While this is a significant advantage for me, it is still a decent amount for Bob, and he will likely accept it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  The money is worth less with each round, and I risk getting nothing if I reject. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise."
