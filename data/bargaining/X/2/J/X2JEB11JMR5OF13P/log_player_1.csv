"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than his previous offer, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation factor. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to accept a deal where I get significantly less than half of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is still more than what he would get with the inflation factor. This is a fair compromise that considers both the value loss and the need to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than his previous one. His share is increasing while mine is decreasing due to inflation. I'm not going to accept this unfair deal. I'll try to make a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Since inflation is hitting Bob harder, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best way to maximize our gains while minimizing the risk of getting nothing."
