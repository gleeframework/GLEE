"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $6000, you take $4000. It's a good deal for the first round.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit imbalanced Alice. Let's split it closer to the middle, with a slight advantage for me since I'm taking the risk in this round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. I'll take a little less than my first offer, $5500, and you get $4500.  Time is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still trying to take a significantly larger share.  While the time pressure is on, accepting a bad deal is worse than no deal at all, especially since I'll be making the offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we need to agree soon!  $5200 for me, $4800 for you.  Don't let inflation eat away at our potential winnings! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is barely better than her last offer, and still significantly tilted in her favor.  With the increasing inflation, the pressure is on, but accepting a poor deal will be worse in the long run. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable in the next round, especially since I know she's aware of the shrinking pot."
