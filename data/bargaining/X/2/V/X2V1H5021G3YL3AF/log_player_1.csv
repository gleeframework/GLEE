Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good deal.  I'm assuming he might be more risk-averse and prefer to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to secure at least half the money now. Inflation is a real threat, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future. This offer at least ensures I get a decent amount, even if it's less than what I initially proposed."
