"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly, or we can keep negotiating.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to set a good precedent and create an incentive for him to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging on this one! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being a bit more aggressive in the second round!

I'll analyze the offer and decide what to do.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the absolute values. In the first round, I offered Bob $2000, and now he's offering me $6000. That's a significant increase in the amount I'd gain, but I need to consider the overall division of the money.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! Let's find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give up, hoping to create a more balanced offer that Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not budging, but I'm willing to give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

I'll analyze the offer and decide what to do. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the absolute values. In the first round, I offered Bob $2000, and now he's offering me $4500. That's a significant increase in the amount I'd gain, but I need to consider the overall division of the money.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. It's only fair.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced solution, where we both get an equal share of the money. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
