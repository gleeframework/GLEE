"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get less if you wait, take this deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is equivalent to $5,000 in the previous round.

Considering Bob's message, I'm not sure if I should wait for a better offer. The message seems to imply that Bob thinks the value of the money will decrease further, but I don't know how much more it will decrease.

For now, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I'm trying to make a more competitive offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'll take it if it's the best I'll get 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the new offer, I'll need to adjust my thinking again. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,500, which is equivalent to $9,500 in the first round.

Bob's message suggests that he's not happy with the offer, but he's willing to take it if it's the best he'll get. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'm also not sure if I'll get a better one in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to...
