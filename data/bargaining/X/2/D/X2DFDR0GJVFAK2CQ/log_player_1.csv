"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous offer considering the game's inflation rules. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not that big! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less for me, but I'm glad Bob is willing to give me a bigger share this time.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like I'll get $70, which is a good deal considering the inflation!"
