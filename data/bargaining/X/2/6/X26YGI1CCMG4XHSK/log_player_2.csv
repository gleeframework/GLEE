"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While 1000$ is something, I'm not going to accept being given the crumbs. I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the bigger share. It's a better deal for both of us than the previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer a more even split, the inflation is hurting my potential gains.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something and avoid further losses."
