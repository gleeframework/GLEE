Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split, Bob. 6000 for me and 4000 for you.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. With 11 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth a bit less in the hopes of getting a larger share.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is now worth 10% less, the total value is $9,000. I'll offer a split of 5,500 for myself and 4,500 for Alice, but I'll frame it as a 55-45 split of the original $10,000 to avoid focusing on the decreased value.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55-45 split, Alice. I think this is a fair division.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice. I'm curious to see how she'll respond."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about this: 5700 for me and 4300 for you. It's a bit closer to my initial offer, but still gives you a decent share.  We should settle this before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. With 9 rounds left, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. The inflation is a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk for now.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'll try to make a more appealing offer next time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer to Alice. Considering the money is now worth 19% less, the total value is approximately $8,100. I'll offer a split of 5,200 for myself and 4,800 for Alice (in terms of the original $10,000), but I'll actually be thinking of it as a roughly 58-42 split of the current value.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, Alice. A 52-48 split seems fair, considering the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice. I'm hoping this one will be more to her liking."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is ticking, Bob.  Let's settle this now. I'll take 5500 and you get 4500. It's a good deal considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. With 7 rounds left, the inflation is starting to take a significant toll on the value of the money. I think it's time to cut my losses and take the 4500, which is still a decent amount. I don't want to risk the value dropping even further and getting an even worse deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I accept her offer, and we can conclude the game."
