"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I want the majority. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd be getting $20, which is worth the same as in the first round, but the $80 he's keeping is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'd be getting a smaller share, but the value of his share is decreasing faster due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not willing to give up more than 40%""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, while still giving Bob a decent share."
