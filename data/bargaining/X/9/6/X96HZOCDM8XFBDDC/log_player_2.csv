"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves us both with a significant sum, Bob. Let's not risk losing it all to inflation.

# Alice gain: 700000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's keep it simple and fair. 50/50 split. No need to risk inflation eating away at our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 sentiment, but inflation hurts you more than me. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us with rounds to spare. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor me to a lower amount by emphasizing the impact of inflation.  While it's true inflation affects me more, I need to push for a better split in the next few rounds. Accepting 350,000 now sets a bad precedent and she's likely to lowball me further in subsequent offers."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the impact of inflation on your share. Let's be sensible and secure something before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is increasing the pressure, but her offer is barely better than the last one. I need to hold firm. While the impact of inflation is significant, accepting an unfair split sets a dangerous precedent for future rounds. I'm betting Alice will be more willing to compromise as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is about finding middle ground. We both know the clock is ticking, and this offer reflects that urgency while still being a reasonable compromise.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm nudging closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but not capitulating.  This keeps the pressure on her while still aiming for a better split than her previous offer. We're entering the stage where a deal is crucial for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this one. It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against you. Let's close this deal and get something! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but I need to accept. Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** We are past the halfway point, and inflation is rapidly eroding my potential gains. Waiting any longer is incredibly risky.
* **Alice's stance:** She hasn't budged much, indicating she's firm on this range. Holding out for a significantly better offer is unlikely.
* **Guaranteed gain:** Accepting now secures a decent sum, even with the impact of inflation. Rejecting risks getting nothing at all if we can't reach an agreement.

While not ideal, taking the 400,000 now is the most rational decision to avoid walking away empty-handed."
