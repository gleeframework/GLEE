"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'll give you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45$ in this round is actually worth less than my gain of 80$ in the previous round. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'm taking control now!""
}
