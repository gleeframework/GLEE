"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to split closer to the middle, Bob, but I need to factor in the inflation. How about we switch it around? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. While she does face inflation, offering me the exact same amount she rejected in the previous round is not a sign of good faith negotiation. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting nowhere fast. I'm moving closer to your offer, but you need to meet me halfway. This is a fair deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving slightly closer to Alice's offer to show I'm willing to compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to make a deal soon due to the shrinking pot. 
* **Fairness:**  While I'm aware of the inflation affecting Alice, I'm still aiming for a slightly larger share to reflect the risks I'm taking by potentially running out of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. This accounts for the inflation impact I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice has moved closer to a reasonable split, and the clock is ticking. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent payout before inflation further erodes the value for both of us. It's better to secure a win now than risk ending up with nothing."
