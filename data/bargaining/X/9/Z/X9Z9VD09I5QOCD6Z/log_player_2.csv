Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a little more. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This still accounts for the inflation, but gives us both a more even split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
