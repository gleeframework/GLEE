Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about a 70/30 split?  It benefits us both to settle this quickly due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
