"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10.  Fair deal, right? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm feeling greedy! ðŸ¤‘  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better. 95/5 is more equitable, and we both get a bigger piece of the pie!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. 60/40, I'm willing to give you a larger share than before. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, 400,000 is a decent amount.  I don't want to risk getting nothing in the next round!"
