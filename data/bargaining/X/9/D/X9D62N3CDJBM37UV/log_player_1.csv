"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not waste any more time with inflated money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

It's now my turn again. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's split the difference""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's split the difference""}\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly before we lose even more money. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

It looks like I've finally accepted Bob's offer! Well, I guess it's better to take the 50-50 split before the money loses even more value due to inflation.

So, the final result is:
Alice's gain: $50 (although it's worth 27.1% less than the original $50)
Bob's gain: $50 (also worth 27.1% less than the original $50)

Thanks for playing the game with me! Would you like to play again?"
