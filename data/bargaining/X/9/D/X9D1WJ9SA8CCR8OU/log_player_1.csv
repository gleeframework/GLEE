I'm starting with a proposal that's heavily in my favor. I know Bob will get a worse deal with each passing round, so I want to secure most of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 50% now. The longer we go, the more Bob will take advantage of the inflation, and I'll end up with even less."
