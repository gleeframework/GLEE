Let's see how Bob likes my generous offer! ðŸ˜œ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

It's not the best offer, but I'm not sure I want to risk Bob getting more money in the next round.  Let's take the 6000 and run!"
