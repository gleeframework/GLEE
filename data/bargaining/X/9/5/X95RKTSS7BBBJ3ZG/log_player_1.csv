"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more but still leave you with a sizable share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too little for me, I want more!""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40% share, I want a higher percentage to compensate for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the further reduction in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 45%."
