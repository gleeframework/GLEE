"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've proposed that I receive $60 and Bob receive $40, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. I've chosen this division because, as the proposer, I have the upper hand in this round, but I still want to offer Bob a significant amount to incentivize him to accept and end the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation. The message is a simple appeal to fairness, hoping that Bob will see the offer as reasonable and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I rejected your offer, but inflation is hurting us both. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer because, despite the effects of inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal in subsequent rounds. Bob's offer gives him the larger share, which I'm not willing to accept this early in the game. By rejecting, I'll get the chance to propose again, potentially leveraging the increasing pressure of inflation to persuade Bob to accept a more favorable division for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to propose a division that slightly favors me but is closer to a 50/50 split than my initial offer. By suggesting that we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise, hoping that the effects of inflation will make this offer more attractive to him. Given that the money's value is decreasing, I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my gain and making an offer that Bob might find acceptable."
