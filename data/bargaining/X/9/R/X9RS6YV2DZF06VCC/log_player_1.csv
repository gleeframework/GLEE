"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start by being generous to Bob, but keeping the vast majority of the money for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as it's a good starting point and avoids the risk of inflation for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, which is better than risking losing even more in the next round."
