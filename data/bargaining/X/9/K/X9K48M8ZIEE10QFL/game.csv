6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time. It's fair considering the inflation we'll have to deal with next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer doesn't make sense with the inflation.  Let's be reasonable: I'll take a slight hit from my original offer and take 5500, you get 4500. This is my final offer.",Alice,3,
