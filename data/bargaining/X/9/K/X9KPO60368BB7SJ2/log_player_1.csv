"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair and reasonable split, don't you think?""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the meeting-in-the-middle approach, but I'll consider it.

Since I'm not sure about the inflation effect on Bob's proposal, I'll do some calculations to adjust for the 20% loss in value.

My original offer was for 800,000, which is now worth 80% of the original value due to inflation. To meet in the middle, I'd get 400,000, which is 40% of the original value. That's a significant drop.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about we split it 55-45?""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is too far off. Let's try 52-48 instead. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

I'm not thrilled about the 52-48 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since I'm not sure about the inflation effect on Bob's proposal, I'll do some calculations to adjust for the 48.8% loss in value.

My original offer was for 800,000, which is now worth 51.2% of the original value due to inflation. Bob's offer is for 460,000, which is 46% of the original value. That's a relatively small difference.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be satisfied and we can finally wrap up the game.
