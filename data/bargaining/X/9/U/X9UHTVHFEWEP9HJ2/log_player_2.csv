"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I think this is a good starting point for a quick resolution. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI don't think this is a fair split. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal. I will suggest a division that I think is more reasonable.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to clarify that since we are in Round 1, the money hasn't lost any value yet, right? The 20% decrease in value for me and 10% decrease for Alice will start from Round 2?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince we are now in Round 2, I will take into account the 20% decrease in value for me and the 10% decrease for Alice.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think an equal split is more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.\n\n###\n\nNote that the values I provided are based on the original $10,000, but keep in mind that the actual value has decreased due to inflation. For me, the $5000 I'm proposing is actually worth $4000 (80% of $5000), and for Alice, the $5000 she would receive is actually worth $4500 (90% of $5000)."
