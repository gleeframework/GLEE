I'm proposing a 99/1 split in my favor.  I figure Bob will be happy to get anything, and I'll still have a large share.  It's a good starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and while I could try to negotiate a better deal, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept in the next round.  The inflation will only make the deal worse for me."
