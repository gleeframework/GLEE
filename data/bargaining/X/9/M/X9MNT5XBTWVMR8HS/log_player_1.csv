"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a more even distribution, and with inflation, this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
