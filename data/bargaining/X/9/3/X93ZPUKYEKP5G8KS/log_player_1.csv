"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 60% for me and 40% for you. It's a fairer deal considering the money's value will drop if we keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
