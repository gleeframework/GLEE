"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 300k, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60%, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the 20% decrease in value, $600,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $800,000 in today's value. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

However, considering the decreasing value of money with each round, I think I should aim to get as much as I can now. I'll accept this offer.
