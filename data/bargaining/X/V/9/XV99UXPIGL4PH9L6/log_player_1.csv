"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk too 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I like Bob's offer. He's taking 70% of the money, which is a significant majority. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split to account for the decreased value. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll take 45 and you can take 55. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give away too much.""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger chunk, but I'll give you a tiny bit too 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is losing value fast! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm not sure I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer to account for the rapid inflation. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll take 30 and you can take 70. I'm willing to give up more, but I need something to show for it.""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
