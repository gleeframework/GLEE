"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm taking a bit more since I'm the first to propose and we'll both lose value on our money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
A 50/50 split is fair given the inflation we are both facing. Taking the offer allows us to avoid further devaluation of our potential gains."
