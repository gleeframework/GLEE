Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, given the risk of inflation. Let's agree on this to avoid further rounds and potential losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
