"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. A fair deal considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is going nowhere. I'll come down to $65, you get $35.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's end this before the value of the money drops any further."
