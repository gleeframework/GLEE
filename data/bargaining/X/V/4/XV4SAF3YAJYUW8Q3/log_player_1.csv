I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to get a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take the 50/50 split now. While I'd prefer a larger share, inflation means my potential gains are smaller in the next round.  Plus, I'm not sure how inflation is affecting Bob's decision-making.  A guaranteed 50% is a good outcome in this situation."
