4500.0,5500.0,Let's split it 55/45. The money is already worth less for both of us. This is a fair deal.,Bob,2,

4200.0,5800.0,"I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation hits me harder. 58/42 is still a relatively fair deal.",Bob,4,

6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The money is losing value fast.  I'm offering you 4000, take it or leave it.  This is your last chance for a decent share.",Alice,5,
