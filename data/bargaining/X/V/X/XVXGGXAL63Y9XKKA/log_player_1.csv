"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'm not thrilled about the offer. However, Bob's message suggests he's willing to compromise, and I don't want to be too greedy.

I'll accept the offer:
