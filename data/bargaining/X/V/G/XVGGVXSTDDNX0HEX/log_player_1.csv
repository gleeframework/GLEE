"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60 and you get 40. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original 100$, which is a fair share considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 40 (50 * 0.8)
Bob gain: 40 (50 * 0.8)

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
