# Bob gain: 57 
# Alice gain: 43 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### I'll accept the offer since it's close to my previous proposal and the money is still worth the same to me, while Alice is losing value due to inflation. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risking further rounds where Alice might become more unwilling to compromise."
