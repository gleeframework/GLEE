Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9,000 and leaving Bob with $1,000.  I figure it's a good starting point, and if he rejects it, I'll have a chance to revise my offer in the next round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer more, taking $3,000 is better than risking getting nothing in the next round.  Inflation is a risk I'm not willing to take right now!"
