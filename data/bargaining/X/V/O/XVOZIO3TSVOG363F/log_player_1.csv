I'm going to start with a generous offer, giving Bob $1000.  I figure this will encourage him to accept and we can both walk away with something.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it seems tempting to take $1,000, I know that if I wait, Bob's offer will likely get less appealing due to inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to slightly reduce my offer for Bob, but still leave him with a decent amount.  Since I rejected his offer, he's likely feeling the pressure from inflation. I'm hoping this will make him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I know the money is decreasing in value for him, but I'm holding out for a larger share. I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to continue to reduce my offer, but I think I'm getting close to a point where Bob might be willing to accept.  The inflation is starting to impact him significantly, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Bob's share is decreasing in value, and I believe I can get a more favorable deal in the next round.  I'm hoping the pressure from inflation will finally push him to make a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to continue lowering my offer, but I'm still giving Bob a decent amount.  The inflation is really starting to hurt him now, and I believe he will be forced to accept a smaller share.  I'm confident that I'm still getting a good deal."
