"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see what Alice will propose if she has to make the offer next round.  I may be able to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair deal.  It gives you a good amount and I feel like it's a good starting point for negotiations.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer my offer from round 2, the potential loss from further rounds due to inflation makes accepting the 50/50 split the best choice."
