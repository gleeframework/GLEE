"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share of the money. I hope Bob will find it a reasonable starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'll try to counter 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can counter my strong start! I'll consider his offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I think I can do better than a 30-70 split. I'll wait for the next round to make my next move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to regain the upper hand. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take the lead, but I'm not letting go!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, trying to regain some ground and put pressure on Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're holding firm, I'll try to make a compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to make a compromise, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'll consider his offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I think I can get a better deal than a 45-55 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain more significantly now. I'll wait for the next round to make my next move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a bold move to take the lead. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle, let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find common ground and end the game. Will Bob accept this fair offer?"
