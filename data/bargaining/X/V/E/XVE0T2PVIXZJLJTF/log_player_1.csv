"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I'm willing to give you 20% to get this started.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount to get the negotiations started, while keeping a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's split the money 80/20 in my favor, reflecting the fact that I'm taking on the risk of rejection this round. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'm willing to give Bob such a large share, especially since the money is worth 10% less for me now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 80% this early. Let's meet in the middle at 60/40.""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping a larger share, but still giving Bob a significant amount to keep the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise and split the money 60/40 in my favor, as you suggested. This offer reflects the fact that we're now in round 4, and I'm still taking the risk of rejection.  Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get me to accept his offer by mirroring my previous suggestion. However, I'm not willing to give him the upper hand now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less for me now, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 60% now. Let's try 55/45. You're not taking on that much risk at this point.""
}
```

This way, I'm still keeping a larger share, but giving Bob a slightly smaller portion than he was asking for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. You're still getting more than 40% of the money, and the inflation is only going to get worse.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at 55/45. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to appeal to my sense of reason, but I'm not convinced. I'm not willing to give him the upper hand now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth significantly less for me now, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging on the 55/45 split. You're getting a better deal than you were in the first round, and I'm taking on the risk of further inflation. Meet me here, or I'll walk away.""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to make a strong case for why I deserve a larger share, and giving Bob a slightly smaller portion than he was asking for."
