3000.0,7000.0,My turn!  How about a 70/30 split in my favor?  Consider that the money will be worth less next round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Okay, I'll give you a little more.  80/20 split.  If you reject this, you'll be getting much less next round, since the money is losing value faster for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and the money is losing value for me every round.  A 60/40 split makes the most sense.  Take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, I'm starting to get a little worried about the inflation.  Let's split it 70/30, with me getting the bigger share.  This is the last offer I'll make before the money really starts losing its value for both of us.",Alice,5,
