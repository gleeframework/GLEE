# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is still being very greedy, and while the offer is better than the first round, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with every passing round. Let's split this fairly, I'm willing to give you 40% but I need to make sure I get a good share as well.""}

Do you accept this offer?","```json

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still too low, and while I'm aware of the time pressure, I'm confident I can secure a more favorable split. I'll continue to negotiate and see if she's willing to come up with a more equitable offer."

Alice's offer is still too low.  Even though we're close to the end, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me significantly less than a 50/50 split."
