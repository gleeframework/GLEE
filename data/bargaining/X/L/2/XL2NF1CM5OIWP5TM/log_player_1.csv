"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
This is a fair starting offer, as it leaves Bob with 10% of the money while giving Alice 90%. While I know that the money will be worth less for both of us with each round, this ensures that we both get something in the first round and allows us to see how the other player will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing more to inflation than Bob, I'm also gaining more money with this offer than in the previous round. Accepting this offer ensures that we both get a decent amount of money, and it avoids the risk of the game continuing and us both potentially getting nothing."
