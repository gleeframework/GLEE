"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the values, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Considering the offer, I'll reject it. I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. I'll aim to get a better share of the remaining value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob. Consider this one.""
}
```"
