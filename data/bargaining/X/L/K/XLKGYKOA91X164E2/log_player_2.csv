"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Time is money! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice, but let's not drag this out. This is my final offer.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:**  Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. Offering her the inverse (60/40 in Bob's favor) sends a clear message that her previous proposal was unacceptable.
* **Time Pressure:**  While Bob is experiencing higher inflation, it's important to apply pressure on Alice as well. The message emphasizes that this is his final offer, implying he's willing to walk away if she rejects it.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting with a strong counter, Bob leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds if Alice rejects.  He can gradually decrease his demand, knowing that each round is costing them both money (though him more rapidly)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. Don't let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactics:** Alice's message is all about time pressure, but she's not significantly budging in her offer. This suggests she's trying to wear Bob down, hoping he'll panic as inflation eats away at his potential gains.
* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice only increased Bob's share by $5, which is a poor concession considering the rapidly declining value of the money. 
* **Holding Strong:**  Bob set a strong initial counter-offer. By rejecting this offer, he signals that he's serious about getting a fair deal and won't be pressured into a bad one."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose with every passing round. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but this is my final offer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Bob is lowering his demand from 60% to 55%, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but holding firm on a reasonably fair split.
* **Finality and Urgency:**  Reiterating that this is his final offer emphasizes that time is running out for both of them. 
* **Appealing to Logic:** By highlighting that both parties lose with each passing round, Bob is reinforcing the need for a swift and mutually beneficial agreement."
