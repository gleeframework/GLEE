Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's be fair, I'll take a little more since I have to wait a round, but this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
