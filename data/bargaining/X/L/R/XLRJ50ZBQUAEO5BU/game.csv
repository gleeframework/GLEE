4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think it's only fair I get a bit more. This is my counteroffer.",Bob,2,
,,This offer doesn't seem fair given the inflation. Let's try to find a better balance.,Alice,2,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"I'm trying to be reasonable, Bob. This offer accounts for the inflation while still giving you a significant share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"You may be losing value due to inflation, but I'm not getting any more patient. This is my new offer.",Bob,4,
,,This offer is getting worse for me with each round.  I need you to consider the impact of inflation more seriously if we want to reach an agreement.,Alice,4,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to reach a deal. This is my final offer - it's a compromise that recognizes the impact of inflation while still giving you a slight advantage. Let's end this here.",Alice,5,
