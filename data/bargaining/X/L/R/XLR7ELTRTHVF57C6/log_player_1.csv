"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about Bob's proposal. However, I don't want to risk losing more in the next round due to further inflation.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
