I'm going for a slightly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!  I won't accept this offer. I'm willing to play this game longer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to make a more balanced offer this round. Since Bob rejected my last offer, I'm adjusting my proposal to be more reasonable, but I'm still aiming to secure a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive with each round, and the inflation is starting to eat into his share. It's time to accept this offer."
