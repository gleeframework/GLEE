I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable and generous offer. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,

Since Bob wanted a more even split, I'm willing to compromise and move closer to the middle, but still slightly in my favor. Let's see what he thinks!"
