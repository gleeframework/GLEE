"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to persuade Bob to accept the offer. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is decreasing rapidly with inflation. Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less to me due to inflation, I think I can still get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share.""}\n\nI've considered the effects of inflation and Bob's previous offer, and I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering a 58-42 split, with me getting $5,800 and Bob getting $4,200. My message conveys that I'm willing to find a middle ground, but I still need a fair share of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it now, or lose even more to inflation next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting Bob's offer is the best decision at this point. The money is worth almost 50% less to me than in the first round, and Bob's offer of $4,000 is better than risking another round and losing even more value. I'm choosing to accept this offer and end the game here."
