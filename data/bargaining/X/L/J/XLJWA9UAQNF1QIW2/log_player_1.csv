Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is cutting it close. It's my final offer.  Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less value the money holds due to the steep inflation rate for Alice. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Bob's offer in this round carries a significant risk. If we don't reach an agreement in the next round, the value of the money will decrease even further for Alice, potentially leading to a worse outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.
* **Bob's Ultimatum:** Bob has labeled this as his final offer. There's a high probability he won't budge further, making a better outcome for Alice unlikely.

Therefore, accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is preferable to risking a much worse outcome in later rounds."
