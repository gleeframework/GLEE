"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation and the limited number of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still hoping for a more equitable split, but I'll offer 80/20 to try and make progress. It's risky, but I believe in a fair outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a tough decision, but I still believe I can get a better deal than 10/90. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a fairer outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I still believe in a fair outcome. I'm hoping Bob will see that we both need to make compromises to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is slightly better than the previous one, it's still not fair. I'm determined to reach a more equitable split, and I'm willing to keep fighting for it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm making a final attempt to reach a compromise.  I'm dropping my offer again, but I still believe in a 60/40 split being the fairest outcome considering the time pressure and inflation."
