"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering my time is valuable""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that with each passing round, the money loses value for me due to inflation, while it retains its full value for Bob. This initial proposal aims to find a middle ground that acknowledges the impact of inflation on my potential earnings. By suggesting this division, I'm hoping to appeal to Bob's understanding of the game's mechanics and the mutual benefit of concluding the game early to maximize our gains. The message emphasizes fairness and the value of time, aiming to set a cooperative tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. We both have equal value in this game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his message suggesting an even split is fair, his proposal actually favors him with a 60-40 split in his favor. This doesn't account for the inflation factor that affects me, making my potential earnings worth less with each round. Accepting this offer would mean I'm not considering the time value of money in this game, which is a crucial element. By rejecting, I aim to push for a more balanced proposal that takes inflation into account, hoping for a better outcome in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I've adjusted my offer. Let's settle before the value drops further""}\n\nIn this round, I've slightly adjusted my initial offer to make it more appealing to Bob while still considering the impact of inflation on my earnings. By proposing a 58-42 split in my favor, I'm attempting to find a compromise that acknowledges Bob's desire for a more even split while also reflecting the decreasing value of the money for me. The message reiterates the urgency of reaching an agreement before further rounds reduce the value of the money even more, aiming to prompt Bob into accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, although he mentions compromise and the willingness to give up a bit more, the proposed 45-55 split still doesn't adequately address the significant impact of inflation on my potential earnings. By round 4, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, making his offer less valuable in real terms than it appears. I believe there's room for a more substantial compromise that takes into account the increasingly disproportionate effect of inflation on my share. Rejecting this offer allows me to push for a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of further inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting hard on my end. This is as low as I can go without feeling undervalued""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make a slightly more concessionary offer to Bob, proposing a 56-44 split in my favor. Given the significant impact of inflation on my earnings by this stage (48.8% less value than in round 1), I'm attempting to convey a sense of urgency and compromise. The message emphasizes that this offer represents the lowest I'm willing to go without feeling that I'm undervaluing myself, aiming to convey a sense of finality and seriousness about reaching an agreement. By framing it this way, I hope to encourage Bob to accept, recognizing that further rounds will only exacerbate the effects of inflation on my share."
