Let's see if we can get a better deal.  I'll make a proposal in the next round."

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I've adjusted my offer. Let's settle before the value drops further 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a more even split. I believe we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting hard on my end. This is as low as I can go without feeling undervalued 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a more even split, I realize inflation is impacting Alice more significantly.  Accepting this offer ensures we both get something, and I'm not risking getting nothing in the end."
