I'm taking a risk by offering Bob only 100,000. He might reject it, but if he does, I'll be making the next offer, and the money will be worth less for him.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though it's a significant amount, it's still less than what I offered him in the previous round. Since the money is losing value with each round, I'm better off waiting for the next round and making my own offer. I'll try to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm offering Bob 150,000 this round. It's less than the 200,000 he offered in the previous round, but still a significant amount. Since I get to propose this time, I'm hoping to get a larger share of the money. I'm willing to give him a bit more to avoid losing out on value due to inflation."
