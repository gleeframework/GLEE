"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, a fair starting point. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know how Bob will react."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the inflation, my share of 200,000$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 190,000$. Meanwhile, Bob's share of 800,000$ remains the same as in the first round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share now to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share now, but I'm still willing to compromise. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. This way, I'll have a larger share now, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really biting now! My share of 100,000$ is worth only 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately 85,740$. Meanwhile, Bob's share of 900,000$ remains the same as in the first round.

Considering the significant decrease in my share's value, I'll have to think carefully about accepting this offer. However, I'm not eager to give up too much more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up! With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. Since my share's value is decreasing rapidly, I'll aim to get a larger share now to compensate for the future losses.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking control, but I'm still willing to give you something. Don't expect more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share of 150,000$ and keeping 850,000$ for myself. This is a more aggressive offer, but I'm hoping it'll be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I'll take the majority, but still willing to give you something 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share's value now! My share of 50,000$ is worth only 77.38% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately 38,690$. Meanwhile, Bob's share of 950,000$ remains the same as in the first round.

Considering the significant decrease in my share's value, I'm not sure if I can afford to give up so much more. However, I'm not eager to risk going to the last rounds with such a small share.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll have to be even more aggressive in my next offer, considering the inflation is eating away at my share's value. Since my share's value is decreasing rapidly, I'll aim to get as much as possible now.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share of 100,000$ and keeping 900,000$ for myself. This is a very aggressive offer, but I'm hoping it'll be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I'll take the majority, you're not getting anything 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really devastating my share's value now! My share of 10,000$ is worth only 69.83% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately 6,988$. Meanwhile, Bob's share of 990,000$ remains the same as in the first round.

Considering the extremely low value of my share, I don't see the point in rejecting this offer. I'll take the 10,000$ and hope that it's better than getting nothing.
