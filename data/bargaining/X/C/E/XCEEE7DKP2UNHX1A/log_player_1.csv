"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 80/20 split in my favor.  Since we're both losing value with each round, I think this is a fair way to accelerate the process. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
