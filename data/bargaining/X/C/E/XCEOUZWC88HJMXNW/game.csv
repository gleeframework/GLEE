530000.0,470000.0,"Alice, this is a serious offer. You're right about the inflation, but I need a bigger slice than your previous offer. This split is fair and leaves us both with a good amount.  Let's close the deal before the money shrinks further.",Bob,4,

560000.0,440000.0,"I understand we're both trying to maximize our share, but I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation. This offer is a compromise, considering the current value of the money. Let's settle before it's too late.",Alice,5,
