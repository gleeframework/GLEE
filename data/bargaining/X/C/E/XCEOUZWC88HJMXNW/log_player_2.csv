Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet in the middle, but I need a bit more considering the inflation. This offer is still generous, and we should settle before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is right about the inflation impacting her share more, this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to push for a larger portion before the potential gains shrink significantly for me in later rounds."

""alice_gain"": 530000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're both trying to maximize our share, but I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation. This offer is a compromise, considering the current value of the money. Let's settle before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the inflation argument effectively, but this offer is worse than her round 3 proposal for Bob. It's clear she's aiming for a larger share than my offers allow, but accepting now would mean settling for a smaller gain than I'm willing to take. The risk of getting nothing is increasing, but I'm betting Alice will become more agreeable as the rounds progress and the inflation eats further into her potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is getting us nowhere. The longer we wait, the less money we both get. I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and guarantees we both walk away with a substantial sum.""
