"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the proposal. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game early. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me with each passing round, I want to wrap up the game as quickly as possible.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle? This offer is fair and leaves us both with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer seems reasonable, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my share. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, the actual value of my gain would be $495,000 (550,000 x 0.9). I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'll take the risk and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""I see you're willing to meet in the middle, but I need a bit more considering the inflation. This offer is still generous, and we should settle before the money loses more value.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less for me than in the initial round. I'm making a slightly higher offer than Bob's previous one, while still trying to maintain a reasonable margin. The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer before the value of the money decreases further.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a serious offer. You're right about the inflation, but I need a bigger slice than your previous offer. This split is fair and leaves us both with a good amount.  Let's close the deal before the money shrinks further. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, the actual value of my gain would be approximately $386,930 (530,000 x 0.729). Although Bob's offer seems reasonable at face value, the impact of inflation on my share is significant. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating, hoping to secure a better deal in the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to maximize our share, but I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation. This offer is a compromise, considering the current value of the money. Let's settle before it's too late.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the impact of inflation on my share. I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob than in my previous offer, while still trying to secure a reasonable share for myself. The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer, given the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth is getting us nowhere. The longer we wait, the less money we both get. I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and guarantees we both walk away with a substantial sum. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my share, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable option at this point. The actual value of my gain would be approximately $296,275 (500,000 x 0.5925). While it's less than I initially hoped for, it's better than risking further devaluation of the money. Accepting this offer ensures that I walk away with a substantial sum, and it's the fairest option given the circumstances.\n\n###"
