"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'll still give you a good deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal, and I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'm willing to take a risk to get a better split. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think 80 is the minimum I'm comfortable with. Can you do better?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, aiming for an 80-20 split. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to go all the way to 80 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With my money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be very careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 75 is a decent compromise, considering the harsh effects of inflation. I'd rather take what I can get and move on."
