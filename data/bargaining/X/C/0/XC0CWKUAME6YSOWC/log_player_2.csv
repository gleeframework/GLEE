"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too low for me. How about this slightly adjusted split?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the lead:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals he's aiming for a larger share. This offer positions him for a potentially better outcome.
* **Slight improvement:** The offer is still generous towards Alice, acknowledging the decreasing value of the money for her due to inflation. 
* **Negotiation tone:** The message is polite and suggests a compromise, aiming for a quicker resolution that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving closer to a more even split, it's still advantageous for Bob to hold out a little longer. The inflation factor is increasingly impacting Alice, making her more likely to concede a larger share in the next round. Bob's position hasn't worsened, so there's a strategic benefit to seeing what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice! This offer is fair and lets us both walk away with a good amount.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased demand:**  Bob nudges his share up slightly, demonstrating that he's aware of the pressure on Alice due to inflation.
* **Sense of urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time sensitivity, hoping to push Alice towards accepting a deal in this round.
* **Balance:** This offer still leans in Alice's favor considering the total value loss she's facing, but it secures a significantly larger portion for Bob compared to the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 462500 
# Alice gain: 537500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable shift:** Alice's offer has shifted significantly in Bob's favor. While it's not quite the 475,000 Bob aimed for, it's a substantial gain compared to the initial offers.
* **Inflation pressure:**  The 18.55% inflation impact on Alice's share is significant. It's unlikely she'll offer a much better deal in future rounds, and her willingness to ""settle"" suggests urgency.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out further carries the risk of Alice offering even less favorable terms, especially as the value diminishes for her with each round. Accepting now guarantees a good deal for Bob."
