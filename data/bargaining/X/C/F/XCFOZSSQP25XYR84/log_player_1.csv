"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'll increase it if you accept 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob this round, I'm not sure if I want to give him the majority of the money. But on the other hand, if I reject this offer, I'll have to make a new proposal next round, and who knows what will happen to the value of the money then.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80/20 in his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. I'll offer him a smaller share, but still more than the 20% he offered me last round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split this time, see if we can meet in the middle""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this round, but I'm not going to give up yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Bob's offer is still a bit skewed in his favor, but I'm not sure if I want to wait for another round and risk the money losing even more value.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, taking into account the fact that the money is worth less and less for Bob with each passing round. I'll offer him a smaller share, but I'll be careful not to give up too much.

```
