"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, given the inflation and that I'm taking the risk of this offer being rejected. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
