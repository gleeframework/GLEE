"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to see if he'll take it, hoping he'll be greedy and try to get more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob is offering me more money, it's still not a good deal. He's getting a bigger share, and the money is worth less for him each round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob this round.  Since he's losing 20% of his money's value each round, I'm hoping he'll accept a very small share to avoid losing even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While it's not ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get. Bob's money is losing value rapidly, so he's likely to make increasingly less favorable offers in the future. It's time to take what I can get before the game drags on further."
