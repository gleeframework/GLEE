"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the money to get the negotiations going.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's try for a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth $4750.

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the first round, but a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
