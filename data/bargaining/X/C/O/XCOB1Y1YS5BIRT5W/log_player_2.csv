Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's previous offer was 30/70, I'll try to counter with a more favorable ratio. My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 25$ is actually worth 19% less than the 30$ I would have gotten in the first round. My offer in the first round was rejected, so I'll try to do better this time. Since Alice's offer is still quite skewed towards her, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 19% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll try to get a better deal than the 40/60 ratio I offered in round 2. My new offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
