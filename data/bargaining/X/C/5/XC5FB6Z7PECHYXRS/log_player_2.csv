"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems fair for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since the money is worth less to Alice with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's split it 65/35. You get the smaller share this time, but remember the money depreciates faster for you, so it's actually worth more than it seems.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a larger share than last round, considering the depreciation. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is better than her previous one, but the depreciation is hitting her harder. I'm going to try to hold out for a better deal, hoping she'll cave sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and the money is losing value rapidly. I'm offering you a smaller share than before, but it's still a decent amount. Let's settle this before things get even worse.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my demand again, but I won't accept an unfair deal. We both lose if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still offering a larger share than she initially wanted, and while the depreciation is hitting her harder, I'm going to hold out for more. I think I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, it's getting late.  The value of the money is plummeting. I'm offering you a smaller share, but it's still better than getting nothing. Let's make a deal before it's too late.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it, but we both lose if this goes on. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is fair, and with the money depreciating so quickly, it's best to accept and avoid losing even more."
