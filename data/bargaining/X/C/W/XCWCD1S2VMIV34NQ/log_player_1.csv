"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed in his favor, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split in my favor, while still being mindful of the decreasing value of money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal than before, but I'm not going to give away all the value!""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away all the value either! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! I need to be careful with my decision.

Considering the current value of money, Bob's offer is still a bit skewed in his favor, but it's closer to a fair split than before. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best one I've seen so far, and the game will finally come to an end."
