75.0,25.0,I propose we split the money 3:1 in favor of my offer. This ensures I have a significant portion while still giving you a reasonable amount.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
20.0,80.0,"I'm not afraid of a 3:1 split. How about a more balanced 80:20 in my favor? It's a fair deal, considering I'm taking on the risk of rejection.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"I suggest we go with a 6:4 split. This balances the risk and reward for both of us, considering the inflation impact on our offers.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,I'm not willing to give up the majority of the money. I'll meet you in the middle with a 50:50 split. Let's end this and share the loss of value equally.,Bob,4,
