"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it's a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation. I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me $6000, which is worth 20% less than my original $9000 offer. While this is a significant decrease, I believe I can still do better. I will reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering Bob $3000, which is slightly less than his previous offer of $4000. However, considering the inflation, I believe this is a fair compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement quickly before the money depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is tough, but considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is getting a bigger share, it's likely I won't get a better deal in the future.  I'll accept this offer and move on."
