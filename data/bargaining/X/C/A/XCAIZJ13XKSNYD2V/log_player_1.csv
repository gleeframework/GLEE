"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, let's try this way. 
# Alice gain: 450000

Round 4

# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share to make up for the lost value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is getting dangerous. Bob is pushing his luck, but accepting a 40/60 split at this stage feels like I'm losing too much ground.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate, but not be walked all over."
