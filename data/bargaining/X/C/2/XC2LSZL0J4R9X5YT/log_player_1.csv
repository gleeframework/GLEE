Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I need a better deal than that. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn again. Here's my offer for Round 3:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIt seems there's been a misunderstanding in the instructions. Given the format and the scenario, I will proceed as instructed, but it seems my previous response was already aligned with the expected format for Round 3. However, to follow the instructions precisely and continue the game, I will resubmit my offer for Round 3 as it was:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I still need a slightly better split. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, and considering Bob's message that this is his final offer, I will weigh the pros and cons of accepting this deal. Since the money's value is decreasing more significantly for me than for Bob with each passing round, and we are already at Round 4 with a considerable reduction in value, accepting this offer might be more beneficial than risking further devaluation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
