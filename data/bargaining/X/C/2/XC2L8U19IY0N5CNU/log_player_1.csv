"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money, as I'm aware of inflation and want to secure a good deal for myself early on. I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping to encourage him to accept and avoid the risk of further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something. Given the inflation, continuing to reject offers could lead to nothing for me."
