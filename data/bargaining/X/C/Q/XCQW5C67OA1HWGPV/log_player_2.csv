Alice's offer:

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground.  I'll take 55% and you can have 45%.  We can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still too early to accept.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is working in my favor:**  Alice is losing value faster than I am. Each round she's more likely to accept a less favorable deal.
* **I have time:** We're only on round 3 of 12. There's room to negotiate further.
* **Holding out for a better deal:** My goal is to secure at least a 60/40 split in my favor."

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split. It's a strong offer considering the inflation working against you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to concede further, but this offer is final. I'll take 40% and you take 60%.  If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both lose a lot. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This offer meets my goal of a 60/40 split. While I could potentially push for more in later rounds, the risk of Alice becoming increasingly desperate and offering a much lower amount is significant. Accepting now guarantees a favorable outcome."
