Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, it's in our best interest to reach a deal soon.  I'm willing to compromise, but this offer is my bottom line.""

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The longer the game goes, the more money loses value for both players, but especially for Bob.  It's important to emphasize this urgency to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Show Flexibility:** I've moved slightly from my original offer to show a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer still gives Alice a slight advantage (as the first proposer), but it's a reasonable split considering the inflation factor heavily impacting Bob."
