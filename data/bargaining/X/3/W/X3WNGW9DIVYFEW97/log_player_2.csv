"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to build trust. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Even a small gain now might be worth significantly less later.  I'll see if I can get a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer in the next round."
