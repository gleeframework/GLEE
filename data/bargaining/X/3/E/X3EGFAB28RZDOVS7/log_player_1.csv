"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to establish a fair and equal division of the funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, but I'll give you more next round if you don't accept now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is actually worth $3200 in real value. I'm not sure what to make of Bob's message about giving me more next round, but I'm not confident that's a reliable promise. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting any younger""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away too much, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
