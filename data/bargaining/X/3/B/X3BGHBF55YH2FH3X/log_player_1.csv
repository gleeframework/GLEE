"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the offer is now 50-50, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for the next round and see if Bob's offer changes."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 50-50, I'll try to increase my share a bit. Here's my new proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll keep waiting for a better offer, hoping that Bob will make a more generous proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

I'm increasing my share again, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
