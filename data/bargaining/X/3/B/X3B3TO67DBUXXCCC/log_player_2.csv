# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems increasingly tempting as inflation eats away at potential gains, Alice is clearly playing a waiting game. She knows my losses from inflation are higher than hers. Rejecting now keeps the pressure on and gives me another opportunity to propose a more favorable split before the losses become too significant."
