"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split of 60/40.  While the inflation is working against me,  I believe this is a fairer offer than your initial proposal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
