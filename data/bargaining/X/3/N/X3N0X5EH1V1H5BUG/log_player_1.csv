"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80 and you can have 20. Then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50-50 split for now, let's see if we can improve on that in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 50 is worth 20% less than the 80 I would have gotten in the first round, but it's still a decent offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
