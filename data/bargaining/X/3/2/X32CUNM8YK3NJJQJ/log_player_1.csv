"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, I'd rather get a higher amount now, even if it's not a 50/50 split. But, I'm not sure if I want to give up that extra $1000 to Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

I've increased my proposed share by $200, trying to balance between getting a good deal and not giving up too much to Bob. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! Considering the decreased value of the money, I'd rather take a smaller share now and get something rather than waiting for a potentially better offer that might not materialize.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, and we can finalize the split."
