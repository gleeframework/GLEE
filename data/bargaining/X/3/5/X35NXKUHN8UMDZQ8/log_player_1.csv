"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me getting 80% of the $10,000 and Bob getting 20%. I'm hoping Bob will see the wisdom in my proposal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $5,500 in this round is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round, which is still a decent amount. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up that much to Bob.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he's willing to accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise again, let's meet in the middle this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, my gain of $5,000 in this round is equivalent to $2,000 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount. However, Bob's gain of $5,000 in this round is equivalent to $2,000 in the first round as well, so it's a fair split.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
