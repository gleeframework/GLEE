"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get the game over with quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth 10% less now, I'd rather accept this offer to get some money rather than risking a worse offer in the next round.
