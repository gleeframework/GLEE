"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can divide the money evenly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more strategic now.

I accept Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $4,000 and Bob will take $6,000."
