"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think about whether the 30% gain I'll get is better than the 50% gain I could have gotten in the first round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was for 70% and I rejected it, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll offer a smaller share to Bob, but still a bit more than 30%.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me this time, but still a fair deal!""
}

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to get a bit worried that Bob is going to try to take advantage of me as the rounds go on. However, considering the inflation rate is now 48.8%, I'll have to think carefully about whether the 40% gain I'll get is better than the 45% gain I could have gotten in round 3.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is getting crazy! With the money Bob gains being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm starting to think that I should just take what I can get. However, considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether the 35% gain I'll get is better than the 42% gain I could have gotten in round 5.
