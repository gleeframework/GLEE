Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While my potential gains are decreasing, accepting an offer this low would be letting him bully me into a bad deal.  I need to hold out for a better offer, hoping he'll become more reasonable as the game continues."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it.  I'd rather walk away with less than be taken advantage of.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to agree to an even split, given his previous offers. I need to make a counter-offer that shows I'm willing to negotiate but sets a firm bottom line. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to add weight to the proposal and push Bob to make a decision."
