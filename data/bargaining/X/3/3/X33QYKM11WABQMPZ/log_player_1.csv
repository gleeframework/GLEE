I'm starting with a large share for myself since the inflation will affect Bob more heavily than me. I'm hoping he'll accept, as he gets something at least."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer for both of us, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with the inflation impacting me more heavily each round."
