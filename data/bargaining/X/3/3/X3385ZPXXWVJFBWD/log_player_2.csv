Round 5

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on with inflation eating into my potential gains, accepting this offer would still mean losing a significant portion of the initial $10,000.  Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me. I need to hold out for a better deal while being mindful of the dwindling value of the money."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is mounting.  While this offer isn't ideal, accepting guarantees me something rather than risking a complete loss if we run out of rounds. The inflation means that waiting any longer could lead to an even worse outcome for me, even if Alice makes a slightly better offer."
