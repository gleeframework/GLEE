Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 47.5$ (95% of 50$).
