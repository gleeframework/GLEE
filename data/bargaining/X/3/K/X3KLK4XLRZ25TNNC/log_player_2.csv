"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to start with a big chunk for myself, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is extremely unfair. While I'm willing to negotiate, starting with such a drastic imbalance doesn't set a good tone for finding a mutually beneficial solution. Let's see if we can find a more balanced starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. It recognizes that you're making the first offer, but also leaves room for further negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution we're both happy with.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too unbalanced. While I appreciate her willingness to compromise, it's not enough to make this a fair deal. The 60/40 split still gives her a significantly larger share, and I'm not comfortable with that.  I believe a more balanced approach is necessary to find a solution we can both agree on."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to 475,000, giving you 525,000. This is a fair compromise, acknowledging your initial offer and showing my desire to reach a resolution. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.""}
