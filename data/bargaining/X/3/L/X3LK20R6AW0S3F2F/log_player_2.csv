"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. Take this offer and avoid the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation penalty for me is only 5%, so I'm willing to take the risk and try to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, I'll get less value in the next rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The money is losing value, Bob. This is a better offer than you'll get in round 4! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, even with the inflation penalty, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The current offer still seems too skewed in Alice's favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, this is a reasonable split. Let's settle before it gets worse for me.""}"
