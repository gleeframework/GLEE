Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split that accounts for the inflation we're facing. Let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is offering a larger sum, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting $400,000 now is a bad deal compared to what I could have gotten in the first round. It's worth risking another round to aim for a more favorable split, even with the inflation penalty."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm taking another hit from inflation. This is my final offer - it's a reasonable split considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** It's round 4, meaning another round of inflation is looming. I need to make a compelling offer to avoid losing more value.
* **Balance:**  While I want to maximize my gain, I need to offer Alice enough to entice her to accept. This offer is still advantageous to me but moves closer to a 50/50 split.
* **Finality:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal to Alice that it's time for a decision. This can help prevent the negotiation from dragging on further."
