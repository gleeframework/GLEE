Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 90/10. This is a fair deal, considering your  20% inflation rate compared to my 5%.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too unbalanced. I propose 70/30. This split still accounts for the inflation, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement before the money is worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000
