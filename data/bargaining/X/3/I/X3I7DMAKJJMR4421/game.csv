40.0,60.0,I think a more even split is fairer considering the inflation we both face.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.,Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise to avoid further losses from inflation.  A 50/50 split is the most fair solution in this situation.,Bob,4,
