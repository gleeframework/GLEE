"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leave $400,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 95% of the original amount, so he's offering me $475,000 and keeping $475,000 for himself.

I'm not sure I want to accept a 50/50 split, especially since I was initially offered a 60% share. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3

```
