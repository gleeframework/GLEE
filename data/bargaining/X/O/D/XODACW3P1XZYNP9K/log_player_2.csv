Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I'll aim for a higher share. However, I'll keep in mind that inflation is a factor and the money's value will decrease over time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the 45 I gain in this round is equivalent to 29.4 in the first round (36% less). That's a relatively low share, but I'll consider it since the game is progressing and the money's value will continue to decrease.
