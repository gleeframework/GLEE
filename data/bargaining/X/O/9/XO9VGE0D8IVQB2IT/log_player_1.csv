"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but we'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too greedy, let's try a more balanced split this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too greedy, does he?

I'll consider his new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too skewed towards you, Bob!""
}
```

I'd like a more balanced split, but I'm not there yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, with me getting a slightly larger share, but still a compromise. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were closer this time, but I think I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get the upper hand!

Considering the new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You were closer, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up yet, and I think I can do better than this offer. The split is still a bit skewed towards Bob, and I'm hoping to find a more favorable split in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob! Let's try to meet in the middle again!""
}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I've got a good feeling about this one, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script!

Considering the new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""You've got a good feeling, Bob? I think you're right!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. With the money being worth less and less with each passing round, I think it's time to wrap things up and get a share of the remaining $1,000,000."
