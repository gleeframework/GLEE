"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting and ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 720,000 (10% of 800,000 is 80,000, so 800,000 - 80,000 = 720,000)
Bob gain: 180,000 (10% of 200,000 is 20,000, so 200,000 - 20,000 = 180,000)

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair split, and I'd rather end the game now than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds. I'll accept his offer.
