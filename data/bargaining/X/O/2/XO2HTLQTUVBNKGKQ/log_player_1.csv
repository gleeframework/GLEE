"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so I can get my share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I'm getting a much smaller share than I was hoping for. Bob's offer is quite lopsided, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds. I'll accept this offer.
