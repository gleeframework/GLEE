Let's start with a fair and equal split."

# Bob gain: 60

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept. The inflation will hurt him more than me this round, so he might be more inclined to take a slightly lower amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair, and the inflation is hurting him more than me. I'm going to keep rejecting until I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is even more lopsided than before.  I'm sticking to my strategy of rejecting unfair offers, hoping Bob will eventually realize he needs to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm going to push my share even higher, knowing that Bob is being hit hard by inflation. I'm running out of time, so I need to make a move that will hopefully get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is completely unacceptable. I'm going to keep rejecting until Bob realizes that he needs to make a more equitable offer. The inflation is hurting him significantly, so hopefully he will come to his senses soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

Time is running out, and I'm getting desperate. I'm going to make a final push for a larger share, knowing that Bob is hurting from the inflation.  It's a risky move, but I need to make something happen before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is completely ridiculous. Bob is taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in.  I'll keep fighting for a fair deal, even if it means we both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm taking a huge gamble. I'm pushing my share as high as I can, hoping that Bob will finally see reason. I'm aware that this might be too much for him to accept, but it's our last chance to get anything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete insult.  While the inflation has hit him hard, I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with practically nothing. We both will get nothing if we fail to reach an agreement, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of just because of inflation. I've held my ground throughout the game, and I'll continue to do so until the very end."
