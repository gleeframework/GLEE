"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $7,000 is actually worth $5,600 (since it's 20% less than the $7,000 I would have received in the previous round).

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
