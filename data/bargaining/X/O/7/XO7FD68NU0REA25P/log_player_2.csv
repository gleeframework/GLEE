It's painful, but at this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 3 rounds are left. If Bob rejects this, there's a very real risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The inflation is hitting Bob hard. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than potentially getting a slightly better deal next round that's been heavily eroded by inflation. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has been consistently firm. It's unlikely she'll offer anything significantly better in the remaining rounds. 

This is a classic illustration of the ""bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" dilemma."
