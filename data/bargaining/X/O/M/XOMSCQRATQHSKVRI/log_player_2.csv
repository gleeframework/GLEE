Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, I'm being reasonable, don't let inflation eat your share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't bluff, I know you're losing value each round 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While the offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, accepting now would still give her a significantly larger share.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it before inflation hurts us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 offer is generous, but I'll take a bit more, considering inflation is only hurting you 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While the current offer isn't ideal, rejecting it poses a significant risk.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the window for negotiation is shrinking rapidly.
* **Increasing Inflation:** The longer the game continues, the more my share is eroded by inflation. Accepting a less favorable deal now might be better than getting a worse one later or even nothing at all.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share and rejected fair offers. It's unlikely she'll agree to a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds.

Taking these factors into account, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is the most logical decision to maximize my potential gain."
