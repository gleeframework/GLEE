**Reasoning:**

While the clock is ticking, Alice's offer is getting worse with the inflation working heavily in my favor. She's feeling the pressure more than I am.  I need to hold my ground a bit longer to secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're approaching the point where greed will cost us everything. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The time for negotiation is shrinking. Offering a 50/50 split might seem generous, but:

* **Time pressure:**  Alice is feeling the heat of inflation more than I am.  
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, even with some inflation impact, is objectively fair and gives her a reason to accept.
* **Preventing Loss:**  It's better to secure half than risk getting nothing if negotiations completely stall."
