"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the money is worth less to him with each passing round. I'll attach a friendly message to set a positive tone for the negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic about the diminishing value. This is my offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although he's being generous, I think I can get a better deal considering the money is worth the same to me but less to him with each passing round. I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $45, taking into account the inflation that affects the value of the money he receives.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing rapidly. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Considering the rapid decrease in value for Bob, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I've managed to get a fairly good deal, and accepting now ensures I don't risk losing more value in future rounds. Game over!"
