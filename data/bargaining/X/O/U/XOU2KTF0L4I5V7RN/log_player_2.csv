"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the 20% decrease in value for Alice, I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice's money is worth 20% less in each round, I'm trying to take advantage of that by offering her a smaller share. Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Let's close this deal now and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I previously offered Alice a worse deal (4500 for her), which she rejected. Given that her money is now worth even less due to inflation (36% less), I think I can still negotiate a better deal for myself. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant decrease in value for you, I think this is a reasonable offer.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice's money is worth 36% less than the original amount. Given that she rejected my previous offer of 5500 for me and 4500 for her, and her subsequent offer of 4500 for me and 5500 for her, I'm going to try to take advantage of the situation by offering her an even smaller share. The message is an attempt to justify the uneven split and appeal to her sense of reason, considering the impact of inflation on her potential gain. Let's see how she responds to this proposal."
