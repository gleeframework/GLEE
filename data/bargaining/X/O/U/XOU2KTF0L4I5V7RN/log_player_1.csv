Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant decrease in value for you, I think this is a reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Taking Bob's offer is the best option at this point. Here's why:

* **Declining leads to a worse outcome:**  If I reject Bob's offer, the value of the money decreases further for me in the next round. There's a high chance Bob will offer me even less, leaving me with less than $4,000 (after accounting for inflation).
* **Significant inflation:** The 48.8% inflation has already eaten significantly into my potential gains.  
* **Bob's offer is consistent:** Bob has consistently aimed for a 60/40 split in his favor.  It's unlikely he'll deviate from this strategy. 

It's better to take the guaranteed $4,000 (after inflation) now than risk getting an even worse deal in the next round."
