"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can propose a better deal if you want!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split the money more evenly. This seems like a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to flip the script, does he?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I'd like to propose a new deal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the initial proposal. Your turn!""
}
```"
