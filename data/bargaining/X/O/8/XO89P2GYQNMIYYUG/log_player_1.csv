"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation""}\n\n\n\n###\n\nI made an offer to Bob, where I get $6000 and he gets $4000. I also included a message to Bob suggesting a fair split considering the inflation. Now, it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept the offer or proceed to the next round. If he accepts, the game ends; if not, he'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Since I'm Alice, I need to be strategic in my offer, keeping in mind that with each passing round, the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. This initial offer aims to find a balance that might appeal to Bob, considering the impact of inflation on his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's be a little more greedy this time, but still try to be fair.  If you agree, we can finish the game now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, accepting $4000 in the second round means the value is 5% less than the original amount, making it effectively $3800 for me. Meanwhile, Bob's portion, although larger, suffers a 20% decrease in value, making his effective gain $4800. Given the significant disparity in how inflation affects us, I believe there's room for negotiation to find a more favorable split. It's my turn again, and I'll need to make a strategic offer that considers the decreasing value of money for both of us, especially the steeper decline for Bob. My goal is to propose a division that Bob might find acceptable, taking into account the increasing loss of value with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've made an offer where I get $5500 and Bob gets $4500. Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on Bob's portion, I've aimed to find a middle ground. The message to Bob emphasizes the need for a mutually beneficial agreement, considering the devaluing of the money with each round. My offer takes into account that while I lose 5% of the value, Bob loses 20%, making his effective gain significantly less. By proposing a 55/45 split, I'm attempting to balance our interests and encourage Bob to accept, thereby ending the game before further devaluation occurs. This approach also shows flexibility from my initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise that might appeal to Bob."
