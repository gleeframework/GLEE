Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and we can adjust if needed.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 50/50 split. We're both losing value with each round, so this seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I'll take the 50/50 split. With the inflation, I'm already losing a significant amount, and I don't want to risk losing more in the next rounds."
