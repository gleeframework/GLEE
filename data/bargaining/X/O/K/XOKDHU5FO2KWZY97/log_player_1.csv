"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is much worse for me than the first one, and the decreasing value of the money makes it risky to wait.
