Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 75% of the total, I'll try to increase my share a bit. Here's my offer:

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! Okay, let me think... Since Alice's offer is closer to the original 75% split, but still not quite there, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more aggressive. Here's my response:
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is really taking its toll now! With the money being worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my next proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
