Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the 6000/4000 split is better than the risk of inflation in the next round.  It's likely that Bob will offer me an even worse deal if I reject."
