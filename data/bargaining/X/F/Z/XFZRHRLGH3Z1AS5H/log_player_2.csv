Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time. I've come down from my initial offer, but I need you to meet me halfway.  This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.

# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie. But your share is losing value much faster than mine. I'm offering you 45 which is more than you'd get if you wait much longer. Let's be pragmatic and end this.""}"
