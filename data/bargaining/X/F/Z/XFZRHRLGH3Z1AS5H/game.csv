55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's not waste time. I've come down from my initial offer, but I need you to meet me halfway.  This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie. But your share is losing value much faster than mine. I'm offering you 45 which is more than you'd get if you wait much longer. Let's be pragmatic and end this.",Bob,4,
