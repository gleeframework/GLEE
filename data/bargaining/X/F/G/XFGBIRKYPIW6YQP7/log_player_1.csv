Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be real, Alice. We both know this is going nowhere fast. I'm proposing a 50/50 split after accounting for the inflation. Take it or watch our potential earnings shrink. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
