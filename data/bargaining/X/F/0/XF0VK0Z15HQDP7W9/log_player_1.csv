Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it.  This way we both get something, and I minimize the risk of inflation eating away at my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a significant improvement from the previous offer. Accepting this avoids further inflation, which would make my share even smaller."
