"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since I'm not sure about the inflation rate affecting Bob's money, I'll have to consider the worst-case scenario where the inflation rate is higher than 10% for Bob. In that case, the actual amount Bob gains could be even lower.

Given that I'm not sure how much money I'll actually end up with, I'll try to be cautious and reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll try to take a more aggressive stance, considering that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less from round 1 and 10% less from round 2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 4, I need to consider that the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. Given that I'm not sure how much money I'll actually end up with, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, since I'm not sure how much Bob's money is being affected by inflation, I'll try to be cautious and reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 5, I'll try to take a more aggressive stance, considering that the money is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll aim to get a larger share, but still leave Bob with a decent amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with 30% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 6, I need to consider that the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, which is a very significant decrease. Given that I'm not sure how much money I'll actually end up with, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the large decrease in Bob's share, I'll take a chance and accept the offer. It's possible that Bob's share is being heavily affected by inflation, and I might end up with a better deal than I would in a future round.
