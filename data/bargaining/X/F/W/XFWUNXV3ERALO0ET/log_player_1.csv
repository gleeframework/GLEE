"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal. You can't expect to get 60%! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like the 75-25 split. It's too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's more aggressive than my previous one. Since Bob rejected my initial 60-40 split, I'll try to push for a 55-45 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You rejected my initial offer, so I'm pushing for a slightly better deal for myself. 55-45 is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is still too much in your favor. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to give away too much more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to push the deal back to a 50-50 split. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's even more aggressive than my previous one. Since Bob is trying to push for a 50-50 split, I'll try to push for a 52.5-47.5 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split. I'll take 52.5% and leave you with 47.5%. It's time to make a decision.""
