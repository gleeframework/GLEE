"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, with a slight advantage for me to start. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I have some leverage to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'm trying to use this to my advantage by making a slightly more favorable offer to myself. However, I'm still being cautious not to be too aggressive, as Alice may reject the offer and we'll have to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. This back and forth is only hurting me. I propose a 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less for Alice than in the first round, but still worth the same for me, I have a significant advantage in terms of purchasing power. However, considering Alice claims this is her final offer and a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, I'll accept this deal to ensure I get a fair share without further risking negotiations breaking down.\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
