"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair split considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of the original $8000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is $6400.

I'll reject this offer. The offer is not good enough for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 80% of the original amount, so the total amount is now $8,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this round, but I'm still not giving away too much.""
}
```

This offer gives me 75% of the current $8,000, which is a bit more aggressive than the previous round, considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving up yet. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the total amount is now $4,800. Considering the offer, I'll calculate the value of the gains:

My gain of $5000 is worth 62.5% of the original $8000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is $5000.

The offer is actually a good one, considering the inflation effect. I'll accept this offer.
