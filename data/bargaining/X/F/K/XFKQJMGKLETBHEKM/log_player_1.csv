Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more equitable. It's a fair compromise considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out! This offer is still generous, considering the inflation is hitting you harder.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a fair 50/50 split, considering our current inflation rates.  We can both benefit from getting something rather than risking getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 
 
Even though it's not the best deal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes sense. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:**  The value of the $100 is decreasing rapidly for both of us. The longer we wait, the less we get even if we manage a ""favorable"" split.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal is risky. If we don't reach an agreement, we both get $0.  
* **Fairness:** While Bob has been pushing for a larger share, the impact of inflation is more significant on his end. A 50/50 split, while not ideal, prevents further losses for both of us."
