"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, let's start with a fair share.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 70% 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm being too generous, huh?

I'm not too keen on giving up 70% of the money, but I'll consider the offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Considering the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob (5% less from the previous round), I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
