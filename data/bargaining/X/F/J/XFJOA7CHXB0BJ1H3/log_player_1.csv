"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob. It's a good starting point to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is not as favorable as my initial offer, and I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting and proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split this time. After Bob rejected my previous offer, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. We both get a decent amount, and it prevents further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous proposal, and the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money. It's not worth accepting such a low share, especially considering I have a good chance of getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm going back to my initial offer from round 1. Even with the significant inflation, I believe this is still a fair compromise. Bob has shown a pattern of rejecting even splits, and I'm hoping to appeal to his desire for a larger share while still getting a reasonable amount for myself."
