Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the time pressure Alice, but the deal has to be fair to both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to pressure me with a ""final offer,"" but it's still not a good deal.  He's undervaluing the impact of inflation on his end. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to hold out for a better offer considering the money is losing value for him, not me."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 38.9% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message:  Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?
model: {""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, time is becoming a serious factor. Bob is finally willing to split evenly, and accepting now guarantees me a reasonable amount, whereas continued negotiation risks getting nothing at all."
