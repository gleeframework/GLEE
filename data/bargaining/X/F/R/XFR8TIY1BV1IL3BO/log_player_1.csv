I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. This gives me a significant portion of the money while still offering Bob a decent share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'm not going to accept this offer.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to stick with my original proposal.  While the money is worth less for Bob now, I'm hoping he'll realize that rejecting this offer again might lead to him getting even less in the next round."
