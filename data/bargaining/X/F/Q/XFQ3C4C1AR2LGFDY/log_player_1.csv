"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent share and can proceed to the next round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because, although it's a 50-50 split, the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. In this round, I'd be getting $400,000 (20% of $2,000,000) and Bob would get $450,000 (10% of $4,500,000). I'd rather wait for a better offer."

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because, although it's a better offer than before, I think Bob is taking too big of a cut. In this round, I'd be getting $336,000 (48.8% of $686,000) and Bob would get $748,000 (27.1% of $2,590,000). I'd rather wait for a more balanced offer."

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because Bob is taking an extremely large share. In this round, I'd be getting $67,000 (67.23% of $100,000) and Bob would get $900,000 (40.95% of $2,200,000). I'd be giving up way too much value. I'd rather wait for a more reasonable offer."

Do you accept this offer?","The clock is ticking!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because Bob is taking an extremely large share, and I'd be getting a very small amount. In this round, I'd be getting $7,000 (79.03% of $8,900) and Bob would get $950,000 (52.17% of $1,820,000). I'd be giving up too much value.
