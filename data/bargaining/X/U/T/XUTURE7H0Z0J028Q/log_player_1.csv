"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly.""}\n\nI am proposing that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000, with the message ""Let's divide fairly."" This division gives me a slightly larger share, but it is still relatively fair and gives Bob a substantial amount as well. The message is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This way, we each get a good share, and we don't have to keep playing and losing money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems reasonable and the message is persuasive, I think I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try to maximize my gain. I also want to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 10% less to Bob, which may make him more willing to compromise in the next round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and try to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I am proposing that I receive $5500 and Bob receives $4500, with the message ""Meet me in the middle."" This division is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer in the previous round. The message is intended to convey that I am willing to find a middle ground and compromise, and that I hope Bob will accept this offer and end the game. I am taking into account the fact that the money is worth less with each passing round, and I want to try to find a mutually acceptable solution before the value of the money decreases further."
