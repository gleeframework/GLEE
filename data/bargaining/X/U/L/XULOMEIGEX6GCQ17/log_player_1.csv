"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... With the money being worth 20% less, my potential gain is now $32 (40% of $80, which is 80% of $100). That's a decent amount, but I can do better.

I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","It's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth 51.2% of its original value, my potential gain is now $15.60 (30% of $52, which is 51.2% of $100). It's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll think carefully... and decide to accept this offer.
