"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and propose a 99/1 split in my favor.  Since it's the first round, I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and accept this offer. After all, 1 dollar is better than nothing!  Let's see how this plays out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm a bit annoyed Bob rejected my first offer, I'm not going to be too stubborn. A 50/50 split is a fair deal, and it's better than the risk of getting nothing if we continue to play. I'll accept this offer."
