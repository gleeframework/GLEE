"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 56 (70 x 0.8)
* Bob gain: 24 (30 x 0.8)

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll decide to...
