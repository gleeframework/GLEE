"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While starting with negotiation is good, Alice is taking far too much.  Bob needs to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. It's a strong offer considering the inflation working against you."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. Consider it a step towards a fair outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is budging, but very slowly.  She's leveraging the inflation against Bob, but he needs to hold firm for a better deal. Another rejection will make it clear Bob is serious about a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer. We both know the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  55/45 is a compromise, and it benefits you to accept now."" 
}
