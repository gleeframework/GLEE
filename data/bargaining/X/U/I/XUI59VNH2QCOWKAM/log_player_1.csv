"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share, and we can start the game. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as happy with the offer as I was with my original proposal. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
