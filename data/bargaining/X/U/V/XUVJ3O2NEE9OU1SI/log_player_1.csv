"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the 5% inflation, my gain of 300,000 is actually worth 285,000 in real terms. That's a significant difference from the 500,000 I was hoping for. On the other hand, Bob is offering a significant amount, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
