Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected 50/50, now I'll take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like the fact that I'm getting a smaller share of the pie. I'll try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not to my liking, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself."
