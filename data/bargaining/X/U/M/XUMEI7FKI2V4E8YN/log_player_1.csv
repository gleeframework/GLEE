"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you get 20. Accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount to start with, and I'm taking the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get something out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly. I'm still hoping to get a larger share, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80%).

I'll make a new offer, trying to take a larger share of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 40, but I need to take the majority to make it worth my while. Accept?""
}
