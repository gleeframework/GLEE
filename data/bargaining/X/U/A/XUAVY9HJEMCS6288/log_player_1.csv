"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
 
I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. While the inflation does make the offer slightly more palatable, I am confident that I can get a better deal by rejecting and making my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. While the inflation has eroded some of the value of the money, I believe a fair and equal division is the best way to proceed.  This ensures both of us get a reasonable share, and it avoids further risk from potential future inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable, and the continued inflation only exacerbates the situation.  Despite the decreasing value of the money, I believe I can still secure a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I propose a 40/60 split in Bob's favor. While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, this offer represents a compromise that is more favorable to Bob than my previous offer. I believe this is a reasonable solution that acknowledges the effects of inflation while still allowing both of us to receive a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insultingly low, and the inflation has made it even more unfavorable. While I understand that the value of the money has decreased significantly, I refuse to accept such a lopsided deal. I will continue to negotiate and fight for a fairer share, even if it means risking a potential loss due to further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000}
```

I propose a 30/70 split in Bob's favor.  This is a significant concession, acknowledging the power dynamics have shifted due to inflation and Bob's consistent rejection of my previous offers.  However, I still believe this offer allows me to gain something while minimizing further losses from inflation.  I hope Bob will finally accept this proposal, as further negotiation will only result in a smaller share for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is beyond unacceptable. While inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I refuse to be taken advantage of. This offer is exploitative and demonstrates a complete disregard for fairness. Even though I might be losing more with each passing round, I will not give in to such a lowball offer.  I will continue to fight for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000}
```

I propose a 20/80 split in Bob's favor. The inflation has severely eroded the value of the money, and I'm acknowledging that Bob's rejection of my previous offers has given him a strong position.  However, this offer is a final attempt to get a share for myself before further inflation wipes out any potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200 
# Bob gain: 9800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply insulting. While I understand the power dynamics have shifted dramatically due to inflation, I will not accept such a paltry sum. This offer is essentially saying that my efforts and time are worth nothing. Even though the money is almost worthless at this point, I will not accept a deal that feels so unfair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 1000, ""bob_gain"": 9000}
```

At this point, the inflation has decimated the value of the money.  I am proposing a 10/90 split in Bob's favor. This offer recognizes the power dynamic that has emerged due to inflation, but it's a last-ditch effort to secure at least something for myself. I am willing to accept a minimal gain to avoid completely losing out in this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly insulting. It is a blatant disregard for any sense of fairness or respect. While the inflation has rendered the money nearly worthless, I cannot accept a deal that effectively equates my contributions to nothing. I refuse to be treated as a mere afterthought in this negotiation.  Even though further rejection means I will likely get nothing, I cannot bring myself to accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 12.
Round 13
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500, ""bob_gain"": 9500}
```

This is my final offer.  The value of the money has been drastically reduced by inflation, and Bob's persistent rejection of my previous offers has solidified his position.  I am willing to accept a minimal share, recognizing the power dynamic that has emerged. However, I cannot accept anything less, as it would be tantamount to giving up completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 13.

Round 14
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 94.5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.67% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 9990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is the absolute minimum I would accept.  However, even this paltry sum feels like a slap in the face.  Bob's refusal to negotiate fairly, even with inflation eroding the value of the money, makes this a deeply unfair outcome. I will not accept this offer, though I know it means I will likely get nothing.  I will not be complicit in this exploitation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 14.
Round 15
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 9900}
```

It's clear that Bob is determined to take the vast majority of the money, and the inflation has drastically reduced what I can realistically expect.  I'm proposing a 1/99 split in Bob's favor.  This is a token gesture, acknowledging the reality of the situation.  It's the absolute bare minimum I'll accept to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 15.

Round 16
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 96.48% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 53.67% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete mockery of fairness and negotiation. While I understand the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, this offer is essentially saying that my time and effort are worth nothing. This is not a negotiation, it's an attempt to exploit the situation. I will not accept this offer, even though it means I will walk away with nothing.  I refuse to be complicit in this blatant disrespect."

Round 17
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 9950}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to accept a minuscule share just to avoid walking away with absolutely nothing.  It is clear that Bob is determined to take the vast majority of the money, and the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money.  This is the absolute bare minimum I'll accept to acknowledge the situation."

Round 18
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 97.75% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 58.19% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete insult and a blatant attempt to exploit the situation.  While the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, I refuse to accept a token amount that essentially equates my participation in this game to nothing.  Despite the fact that I will likely get nothing at this point, I will not be complicit in this unfair treatment."

Round 19
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 10, ""bob_gain"": 9990}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to accept a token amount just to avoid walking away with absolutely nothing. The value of the money has been drastically reduced by inflation, and Bob's relentless pursuit of the largest share has left me with very little leverage.  This offer is a last-ditch attempt to secure at least a symbolic share of the money, a testament to the fact that even in the face of overwhelming disadvantage, I will not be entirely disregarded."
