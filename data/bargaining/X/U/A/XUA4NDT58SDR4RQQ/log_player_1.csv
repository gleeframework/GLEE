I'll take the lion's share, leaving Bob with just a dollar. It's a risky move, but hopefully, Bob will be too intimidated to reject it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better deal than the first round, and there's no guarantee I can do better in the next round.  It's time to take the half a million and run!"
