I'm going to start with a fair offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept and get something rather than risk getting nothing at all."

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but I'm still leaving a decent chunk for Bob.  Hopefully, he'll realize that we're both losing money with each round, and it's better to settle than to risk getting nothing."

Bob is being incredibly stubborn! I'm starting to think he doesn't want to reach an agreement. I'm still not going to give in to his demands. I'm going to try one more round to see if he's willing to budge."

I'm going to try one final time to make a fair offer to Bob.  This is getting increasingly risky, but I'm still holding out hope that he'll realize that we're both losing money with each passing round.  Hopefully, he'll see that a little bit of money is better than nothing."

Okay, Bob's getting a little more reasonable.  I'm willing to accept this offer, even though it's not ideal.  It's better than getting nothing at all, and the risk of getting nothing just keeps going up."
