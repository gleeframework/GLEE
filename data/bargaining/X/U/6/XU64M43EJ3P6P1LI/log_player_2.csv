Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, that's a tough start! How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It benefits us both to settle this sooner rather than later due to the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. Let's meet in the middle with a 60/40 split in my favor. We're both losing money with each passing round, let's settle this quickly.

# Alice gain: 60

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and the fact that you're losing value with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll accept a 55/45 split in your favor.  It's better than nothing.  Let's get this done and stop losing money! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is willing to accept deals that are less favorable to her.  We just rejected her offer of 55/45 in her favor in Round 4. She's now offering the same split in *our* favor. This indicates we have a strong negotiating position, and it's highly likely we can secure a better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a compromise. Let's settle this now with a 58/42 split. It's a strong offer considering the time crunch we're both under.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** We are pushing our luck a bit, but Alice's offer in Round 5 demonstrates her increasing desperation.  We are aiming for a slight improvement over our Round 4 offer, capitalizing on her eagerness to close the deal.  There's a risk she'll reject it, but the potential reward of a better deal outweighs the risk of getting a worse deal in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this.  We're both losing money, and it's clear we're not going to agree on a split that favors one of us more than the other. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to settle this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While a 58/42 split was our goal, Alice is correct â€“ we're both losing substantial value with each passing round. A 50/50 split guarantees a decent payout and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we push our luck too far."
