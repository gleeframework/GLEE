"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this over with, I'm starving!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not starving yet, let's wait a bit longer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 0% less for me, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round.

I'll accept this offer, since I get 300,000$ which is a better deal than the 100,000$ I would have gotten in the first round.
