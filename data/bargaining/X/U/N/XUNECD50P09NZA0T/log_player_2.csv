Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I won't go below 65%.  We both need to consider the ongoing inflation, and a 65/35 split is a fairer reflection of that. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
