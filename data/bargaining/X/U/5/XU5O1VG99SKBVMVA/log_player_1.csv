"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one initiating the offer. I'm confident Bob will find it acceptable, but we'll see!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I understand that the inflation affects my gain, I'm not willing to accept a 10/90 split just yet. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share slightly to 80% and increasing Bob's to 20%. I believe this is a fair compromise, given the inflation factor.  I hope Bob sees it that way too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still believe we can reach a more equitable agreement.  While inflation is impacting my gains, I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share further to 60% and offering Bob 40%.  I believe this offer reflects the inflation impact while still being fair to both of us. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
