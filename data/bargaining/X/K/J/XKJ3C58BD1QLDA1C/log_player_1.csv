"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 90% and you get 10%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, giving me the majority of the initial amount, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the rejection, let's aim for an equal split to ensure fairness in the game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll actually get $450,000.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
