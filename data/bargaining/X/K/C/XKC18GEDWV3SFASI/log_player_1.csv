"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but you can do better 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer for now. I think I can do better than 70% of the remaining value. I'll wait for a better offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

I'm increasing my share to 80% of the remaining value, hoping that Bob will accept this offer."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I want to keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...
