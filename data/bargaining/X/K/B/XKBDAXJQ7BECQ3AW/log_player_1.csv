"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a very aggressive strategy, but it maximizes my potential gain in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While it seems like a good deal for me now, I know Bob is playing a very similar strategy to mine.  By rejecting, I can force the game into a third round, where I will be the one making the offer again. The inflation will likely affect Bob more than me, so I can potentially get a much better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999998, ""bob_gain"": 2}
```

I'm sticking with my aggressive strategy. Since I know Bob rejected my previous offer, I assume he is being equally greedy. However, I increase Bob's share slightly to 2, making the offer seem less hostile and perhaps more appealing due to inflation. This is a gamble, but I believe it increases my chances of getting this accepted and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 999998 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While it seems like a good deal on the surface, I can see through Bob's strategy. He is trying to use the power of inflation to his advantage, and I'm not going to give in. By rejecting, I keep the game alive, and we'll be back to my turn in the next round. The inflation will likely be even stronger by then, which could work in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999995, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I'm increasing Bob's share again to 5. This is still a very favorable deal for me, and I believe the combination of inflation and my consistent rejection of Bob's offers will make him more willing to accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 999995 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it seems tempting, especially with the inflation affecting Bob's share more, I'm sticking to my strategy. I've noticed a pattern in Bob's offers, and I'm sure that the next round will see another small increase in my share. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round when I'm making the offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share to 10.  I'm aware of the inflation's increasing impact on Bob's share, making him more likely to accept.  This is a risky strategy, but it's time to see if I can secure a deal before the inflation eats away at my share too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While I would prefer to have a larger share, I realize that Bob is playing a very similar game to me. He is using inflation to his advantage and is likely to continue doing so. By accepting this offer, I avoid the risk of further rounds and the potential for even lower gains in the future."
