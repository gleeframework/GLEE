"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I'm starting with a very generous offer, taking 90% of the money and giving Bob 10%.  This is a risky strategy.  While it's unlikely Bob would accept this in the first round, it establishes a high baseline and forces him to consider the possibility of getting even less in subsequent rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer more, it's important to consider the inflation.  If I reject this offer, the next round will leave me with only 320,000 (80% of 400,000) and Bob could potentially offer me even less. It's better to take the 400,000 now and secure some gain."
