Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer or we both lose out. It's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but it's getting very risky for Bob. He needs to apply more pressure. While this is her ""final offer,"" she still loses everything if Bob rejects and he offers her *anything* in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4400, ""alice_gain"": 5600, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm standing firm. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. It's your last chance to get anything.""} 

**Reasoning:**

This round is about applying maximum pressure to Alice.  She's shown a willingness to take a larger share, but Bob needs to make her sweat a little. 

* **The Offer:** A slight bump for Bob from his last offer. This isn't about being generous, it's about making Alice think Bob might be willing to negotiate a little.
* **The Message:**  Direct and firm. By emphasizing it's her last chance to get *anything*, Bob highlights the very real risk she faces if they don't make a deal now."
