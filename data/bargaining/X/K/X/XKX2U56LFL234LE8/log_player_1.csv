"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. 60-40 is a reasonable start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to reject or accept! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round, so I need to be cautious. Bob's offer is a 75-25 split, which is quite aggressive.

I'll reject this offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too one-sided, Bob. I'm not ready to give up 75% of the pot yet.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, Bob. 55-45 is a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I still think I can do better. Your turn to reject or accept! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now due to inflation. Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is actually more favorable to me than my previous offer.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept it, as Bob's message suggests he thinks he can do better. I'll reject this offer for now.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll stick to my guns.""
}
```"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. 52-48 is a fair split, considering the circumstances.""
}
```"

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now due to inflation. Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise.

I'm not sure if I should take it, but Bob's message suggests it's his final offer, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. 50-50 it is. Let's call it a day.""
