"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $90 and Bob receiving $10. This is a very generous offer, considering I could have proposed an even split and still had a good chance of getting it accepted. However, I believe this will incentivize Bob to accept early on and avoid the risk of losing money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer gives me something, it's significantly less than what I proposed in the first round. I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself, especially with inflation affecting the value of the money.  I'll see what Bob offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 60/40 split, hoping to find a middle ground that's more appealing to Bob than his previous offer. This still gives me a substantial portion of the money, while demonstrating a willingness to compromise. The inflation factor is becoming more significant, so I need to secure a decent amount now."
