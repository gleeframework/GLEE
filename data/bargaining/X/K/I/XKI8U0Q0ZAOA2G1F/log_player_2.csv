Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point, but the inflation is significantly impacting me. I'm proposing a 58/42 split, which is a compromise considering the circumstances. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Here's why accepting is the best choice in Round 3:

* **Declining means bigger losses:** If I reject, we go to Round 4.  The money will be worth even less then, hurting me more than Alice due to the different inflation rates.
* **Alice's offer is reasonable (in this situation):** While not ideal, a 58/42 split is better than what I might get in Round 4 after more inflation. Alice has also labeled it her ""final offer,"" adding weight to her statement.
* **Something is better than nothing:** If negotiations completely break down, we both get nothing!

It's a tough call, but in this scenario, cutting my losses and accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice.
