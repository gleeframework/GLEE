Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. We both face inflation, so a fair split is the best option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
Although Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, he's trying to mislead me about the inflation. I know the money loses value with each round, and a 50/50 split in later rounds will benefit him significantly more than me.  I need to push for a slightly better split in the next round while the money is still worth a bit more."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share to compensate for inflation, but I believe a nearly even split is still fair. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is tricky! Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, but it's still not in my best interest. He's banking on me feeling pressured to accept as the value decreases. However, if I reject this offer, he's very likely to concede even more in the next round, inching closer to a truly fair deal considering the inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5640,
""bob_gain"": 4360,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer, and it accounts for the decreasing value fairly. Let's close this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Time Pressure:**  By round 5, the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. I need to signal that I'm serious and won't accept a deal heavily in Bob's favor.

2. **Slight Concession:** I've slightly lowered my ask from the previous round (from 5463 to 5640). This shows a willingness to compromise, but not at the cost of a fair deal.

3. **Finality:**  Calling it my ""final offer"" adds weight and might push Bob to accept.  He knows if he rejects this, my next offer will likely be even less favorable to him due to inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every round. I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share to end this quickly and minimize our losses. Let's do this. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but it's likely the best offer I'll get at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:**  I'm losing over 22% of the value with each round now. Holding out any longer is very risky.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob knows he has the upper hand with the inflation working in his favor.  It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better than this.
* **Potential Losses:**  If I reject this offer, my next offer, even if Bob concedes a little more, might end up being worth less in real terms due to another round of inflation.

While not ideal, accepting this offer cuts my losses and avoids the risk of an even worse outcome in later rounds."
