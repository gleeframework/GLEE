"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's a long game, we can be more creative later. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It's my turn again.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's a fair split, and I'm willing to move forward with 50-50."
