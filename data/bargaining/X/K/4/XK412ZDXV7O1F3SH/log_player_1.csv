"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70 and you can take 30.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50, you take 50. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth 40% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, as it's a bit less beneficial for me than my initial offer. However, it's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing another round of inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
