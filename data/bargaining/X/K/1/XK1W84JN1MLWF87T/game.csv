570000.0,430000.0,"Bob, that's a tough break for me with the inflation, but your offer was a bit too low. How about 57/43?  It's closer to the middle ground and avoids dragging this out further.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Considering the increasing inflation penalty you're facing, I think 58/42 is a more suitable compromise. The longer we drag this out, the less you'll actually gain.",Bob,4,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit from inflation, and you're just sitting pretty.  55/45 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"You said 55/45 was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. Given the substantial hit you're taking from inflation, I think 60/40 is more than fair. It's time to settle.",Bob,6,
