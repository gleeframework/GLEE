Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split was a good try, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is severely hurting, but Alice is clearly trying to exploit that. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss compared to even a few rounds ago. It's a gamble, but holding out hope for a slightly better deal in the dwindling rounds is still the better strategy."

Round 8

# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The inflation has eaten away at the potential gains significantly. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing in the few remaining rounds. Alice knows the pressure is on and is unlikely to offer anything better."
